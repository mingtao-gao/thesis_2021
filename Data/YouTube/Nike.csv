i'm really excited about the youthclimate movement being likeferociously passionately brilliantly ledby teenage girls you don't have to becalled an activist to talk about what'sright[Music]i'm curious if there was a moment billywhen you were likeoh climate change the phrase globalwarming i had no idea what that meantyou know i was like it's warm yeahwarm sounds like kind of a nice thing itdoes sound like a nice thingi don't know if there was a specificmoment it was just kind of a growingthingof me just like damn this is reallygoing onand it's really getting worse so so yougottayou gotta do something with all thatcaring absolutely it's so much easierto just say nothing right it's likeevery little thing really does matteras as small as it may be i just feelbetter as a persondoing them you know little things i feelbetter as a personnot eating meat and dairy i feel betteras a person not using strawsi want to know like what your feeling isonhow and where to like channel our energywhen it comes to addressing the climatecrisiswe have to transform everything rightit'selectricity it's transportation it'slike buildings and agriculture and landuse and manufacturing like it'sall of this it actually helps me tochoose an area of focusright like i am a marine biologist so ifocus on the ways that theyou're smoking at me like a real lifemarine biologyi know because it's crazy go on yeah myfocus is on this likeintersection between ocean and climateand used to be more so on the scienceside but now it'son the policy side right because it'slike this crazy puzzleof science and policy and economics andculturethat all add up to how we live togetheron this planeta lot of the world is like well ifyou're going to speak up you have to be100committed to every single thing thatgoes with what you're sayingbut really it's not about being 100perfect it's aboutdoing what you can how would yougo about talking to somebody that wantedto know how they coulddecide what to care about a lot of timeswhen people ask me about thisit's like what's the one easysimple quick thing i can do to save theplanet and i just want to say likeyo we are so past that point for me thequestion is like what's the thing youcan dofirst the way that i think about it iskind of like a venn diagram imagine likethree overlapping circles the first onewould belike what are you good at like whatskills do you have beinga web developer or a farmer or an artistor a teacher or a lawyer or someone whomakes thingsreally cool so that people want to joinin and then there's likewhat is the work that needs doing rightwhat is the whole list of climatesolutions that we need to like go fullspeed ahead withand then there's the part that likepeople don't think about enough which iswhat brings you joy like what's gonnaget you out of bed in the morning sothatthis is not just like a miserable slogi love it how are you exploring that foryourselfhow are you finding that it's likeexcitingfor you to show up i've

i've changed the way that i live mylifei just got shivers just saying that justbecause even as small as it could beis so impactfuli have talked about this since i canrememberdon't shove whatever you want someoneelse to feeldown somebody else's throat you have tolet them come to itby telling them about it talking to themabout it telling them how youfeel about it not how they should feelabout it nobody's going to want to dosomethingif they're forced into it it's just howwe as human beings workwhen we think about who's impacted bythe climate crisisit's often communities of colorpoor people who people who are alreadymarginalized who just get likehit the hardest by the impacts rightwhether that's likehurricanes or floods or wildfires ordroughtsit's people who don't have a lot ofoptions and resourcesto protect themselves or to rebuildtheir lives who aresuper at risk when we talk about climatejustice it's making sure thateveryone has an equalopportunity for a healthy and safe lifeeven though the world is changing aroundus and if we don'tdo that then in my opinion like we won'thave solved the problemi'm really excited about the culturalshift that's happening that you're apart ofhow do we shift the status quo how do weshiftwhat's normal something that's beenreally excitingfor me is seeing how hardcompanies are going at trying to makeclothes and shoes andany type of merchandise for whateveras you know climate friendly as possibleso it really matters that someone isbrave enough to say likewe're gonna eliminate waste from oursupply chain like whatever the thingsare i think that's sokey to like have the bar just going upand up and uplike people used to repair their socks idon't know i feel like i've read this inlittle house and they're like darningsocks or something

these are 180 dollar shoes this is notsponsored we have these awesome brandnew Nike joy issues these are the latestinnovation in the race to create themost comfortable running shoe or justwalking shoe you've seen adidas boostthat came out I don't know maybe likefive six years ago and we did the easiesthey are crazy comfortable we'vepurchased so many pairs and we've alsotried the Nike epic react is that whatthey're called the epic yak shoes andthose ones are pretty good too they'repretty soft but supposedly these are 35%softer or cushier 35% then yeah35% a whole Kevin Durant softer than theepic reactoh my I get it it took me a minute yeahthat's okay sometimes there's beenchoosing the past that have come outthat we're like you know what if wedon't cut them open because what'sreally inside it is it really thatinteresting self-lacing shoes how's itfeel those are pretty cool Easy's let'slook at the inside of these guys thoseare pretty cool is there a prettyhigh-end these ones are 100% shoes thatwe should be cutting open becauseapparently there are thousands of littledippin dots like rubbery bouncy ballsinside of the sole of these shoes allthe way up here there's a bunch of ballsinside of that it looks really cool Ilove the orange on the bottom and thislittle part right here and just likewhen you're walking around you can seethe little beads inside which is so coolso what did people say it's cool and youwear these to school did anybody noticethat there yeah a lot of people noticeand they're like what are those shoesI've never seen them before those arereally cool like like feel about they'recool okaywe got both of these pairs about a monthago these ones we haven't messed withbut Lincoln has been wearing these onesyeah you see the difference yeah let'ssee do you see the difference in thatone month of wearing them and they'repretty dirtythey look pretty messed up when I firstput them onit's kind of weird cuz you'd feel theballs inside of it but it's reallycomfortable like one of my favoriteshoes that's kind of what I felt like -it feels a little strange because itreally is pouches and you're walking onthem and they move almost every timethat you walk and now is probably myconcern like this you kind of think ofit as like I don't know a beanbag if yousit on it the same place over and overagain it's just gonna have that littlespot right there and thank you says ifthat doesn't happen so anyway enoughtalking about these I want to cut thesethings open see how many beats are inthese I was thinking we cut open oneshoe we put them inside of this and weliterally like one by one count and seehow many beads are what if I was like athousand do we have to count there'smore than a thousand I bet every singleone one by one all of these all of themin one shoe there are so many is thatthere's no way[Music]all right Nike joyrides we are going tocut you open these are 180 dollars shoesand these ones have never been wornthey are nice on that side but somethings have to happen for science[Music]whoa they're like bouncy balls oh mygosh nothing everywhere okay we gottacount them all they really did put likelittle squishy toys into little tinypieces and put them down in here you'renot styrofoam but they're kind of likestyrofoam it's just like a squishy toylike you can you can compress it all theway and then it pops right back upsquish it squish it doesn't it feel likea squishy toy oh like a stress ballshe's an expert when it comes to squishyso that's that's better the stress ballthere's so many in this and on thebottom you can see now that it's outit's just like soft but it's hard to getthat open because you can see the littlepillar system it's connected prettytightly let's cut that a little bit moreyeah the little pillars are made out offoam also yeah that's starting to wonderif they're just like be they're justthey like the same material so ballswhich is the same material as this greenpart right here that's really creativeto make this is a material really softbut then also make the rest of the shoeout of that same material look at thatthere's the inside of the system okaywe're getting closeryeah I'm not a good surgeon but we'regetting closerah there we go so that's that top partyou can see the oh the middle pocketokay there's one we got to separatethese um give me another cut Lincoln itlooks like there are four pockets insideof this of the balls one of the very fartoe part one in like what do you callthat part of your foot I don't know andthen there's one right here that's inlike the mid section of your foot andthen one on the heel so four sectionsboom boom boom and they're bulging withthese stress balls after hundreds ofmiles of people running how do they notturn into like a bean bag and get wayout of shape and let gets stuck in oneposition or does water affect thesethings I don't know I'm sure Nike testedit but there's a lot of potential testsyou could do with thisfour different pouches we are going toget these inhibitors nothing else on thetable and no other beads guys whoathere's so many more than there there'sball of your foot there's so many[Music]you have to tell every one of thesenobody's ever accounted these before onYouTube when you cut up the last onefind it is there's one that reallypastor that I found it got itwe've saved it okay the last one theheel which we've already seen has a lot[Music]still some in the bottom there's likestill some right in the bottom so thisis what it looks like when it's all cutopen there's the different sections onetwo three the third one is big it's allunderneath this really squishy area andthen the fourth section it's actuallythe biggest of all of them that goes allthe way down to the bottom this is thenike Joyride pretty comfortable shoespretty unique idea and I really likethat how many balls are inside of hereno we are gonna count themI made the decision I am going to countevery single one of these and I'm gonnacount it on a long video so you can seeexactly how many there are no cheatingthey're taking them out it's gonna beexactly how many are in here but I wantyou guys to guess how many do you thinkthere's going to be and then after fourdays whoever gets it right or gets itclosest to the actual number we willcontact you and send you a brand newpair of these you only get one guess ifI look and you commented like five orsix different times or even two timesyou dishcloth just qualified you get onechance put it on there no editing howmany do you think is in here you sawlike complain with it get remote yes thevideo no no no

cap of adidaskumar and under armour combined and notjust since yesterdaythe company from oregon has beendominating its competitorssince the 90s how did nike manage todisplacethe german sportswear giants adidas andpumawhat strategy kept them on top fordecades and what have they planned forthe futurewe take a deeper look into the strategyof the strongest sports brand in theworld[Music]for a long time the sportswear marketwas dominated by german brandsadidas and puma were the big names hadall the resources andknow-how and it didn't look like thiswould change very soonbut phil knight had a different ideaafter graduating from the university oforegon he enrolled at stanford for anmbabeing a competitive runner himself hefollowed his interests and wrote a paperwith the titlecan japanese sports shoes due to germansports shoeswhat japanese cameras did to germancamerashis ambition was to import high qualityand low-cost running shoes from japanwherelabor was cheaper into the americanmarket and that's exactly what he didafter his graduation he traveled tojapan and met with onitsuka taigathe company that would later launchessex impressed by the quality and lowcost of their running shoesknight managed to secure thedistribution rights for the westernunited statesand ordered his first samples whenknight finally received the first shoesafter more than a year of waitinghe mailed two pairs to his former trackcoach bill bowerman at the university oforegonhoping to gain both a sale and aninfluential endorsementtonight's surprise bauermen not onlyordered the shoesbut also offered to become a partner andprovide product design ideasthe two men agreed to a partnership byhandshake and blue ribbon sports wasbornthe company that would later become nikethe founding story already reveals someimportant factors that explain the riseof nikefirst phil knight showed stronganalytical skills by realizing thepotential in outsourcing the productionto japanmaybe even more significant were nike'sroots in sportsto be precise in running like the twoco-foundersmany of the first employees were formerrunnersthey sold their first running shoes tobefriended athletes oftenright on the track one of them was steveprefontainewho was a huge star in oregon at thetime and went on to become nike's firstsponsored track athletesoon people realized that the fastestrunners were suddenly not wearing adidasshoes anymorebut this new local brand knight and histeam quickly realized they had foundtheir perfect marketing strategy whileadidas was close to officials andputting their money on organizationslikefifa and the ioc nike was close toathletesand rather invested in individuals thaninstitutionsthe idea of creating a shoe brand fromathletesfor athletes was also shown in theirhands on research and developmentaside from an intensely competitivemindset bowerman displayedfascination with optimizing the shoes ofhis athletes in the early 1970soregon's hayward field where bauermanworked for yearswas transitioning from a crushed cindertrack to an artificial surfaceand bowerman was searching for a runningshoe that would be suitable for multiplesurfaceswhile watching his wife making wafflesin their kitchen he had his eurekamomenthe simply molded some plastic and pouredit into his wife's waffle ironthat completely ruined the iron but itsgrooves turned out to be a near perfectmould for a running shoebowerman's waffle trainer set aprecedent for nike's culture to innovateand to redefine the status quo andsports equipmentit was the first of many majorinnovations that helped nike gainand expand the lead on its competitorsinventions and designs like air soulsthe air force onenike3 and flyknit followed andrevolutionized the sneaker industrythe latest example is the nike vapourfly running shoethat made headlines because it isliterally making you run fasterit was initially developed to helpelliot kipchogebreak the two-hour barrier for themarathon which he did in 2019 in viennathat event and the fact that nikerunners have dominated the major racesin recent years led the world athleticsassociation to releasenew rules to regulate running shoesbanning shoesbecause they increase performance that'sa similar story to the nba banningmichael jordan's air force onenike couldn't have wished for bettermarketing elliot kipchoge and michaeljordan are just two names from a longlist of nike athletes what started withprefontainequickly developed into the most valuablesport portfolio in the worldother big names of that list carl lewistiger woodsserena williams ronaldinho roger federerlebron james and cristiano ronaldoand the other ronaldo the roster ofathletes clubs and federationsis the heart of the nike brand which isone of the strongest in the world amongall industries their marketing strategyhas been praised many timesfrom their iconic swoosh logo and justdo its sloganto multiple advertisements that have wonemmysbut what's just as interesting as themarketing strategy itselfis how the organization behind thatmachinery worksnike is a so-called matrix organization[Music]that means that employees report to morethan one supervisorfor example if you are a sales managerfor footwearyou might report to the sales directorand the director of footwearthe departments in the matrixorganization can work closely togetherand communicate more frequently toresolve issuesthis frequent information exchangeallows managers to respond quickly tothe needs of the customersand nike's business goals nike's matrixwas previously structured to developmarket and sell based on product typethis allowed them to be efficient insupply chain and manufacturingbut it did not address the needs of theconsumer so in 2008nike made a change to organize based onsportsinstead of products an approach theycalled category offensenike's categories include among othersrunningglobal football basketball and trainingthis change has proven very successfulas sales have grown by70 percent to over 30 billion dollarssince the realignmentmaybe you have even seen the effect ofthe category offense yourself in a storenear youas a market leader nike had so muchinfluence on their retail partnersthat stores changed their layouts tobuild entire sections of the storearound each of nike's sports categoriesthese sections featured footwear appareland equipment tailored to each specificsportmaking the shopping experience moreconvenient for the consumerthe change led to increases in overallspending for multi-sport consumers whonow had a large selection of merchandisefor each of their sportsso instead of owning one pair of shoesto use for bothrunning and the gym people now buy onepair of running shoesand one pair of training shoes thecategory orphan's model has evenimproved nike's financial reporting andplanningnow nike tracks financial performance bysports categoryand is able to make targeted investmentsin the struggling categoriesfor example if they see a decline insales of football bootsthey could decide to sign a footballclub to stimulate salesit is a perfect example how nike usedtheir influence as a market leader tochange the sports industryfrom a focus on product silos to sportscategoryit explains how the company defended andexpanded the lead over adidas and pumain recent yearsbut what are nike's plans for the futuretheir strategic outlookmight be even more interesting thantheir past accomplishmentsafter the category offense in 2008nike's leadership decided that it istime for another strategy changein

adidas vs pumanike versus under armour not manymarkets are as competitive as thesportswear industryhaving the best shoe design greatestathletes and most efficient supply chainthere is a reason that the race for themarket leader has been many timesreferred to assneaker wars but the point is the battleis long decidedthere is no question who the number oneisnike's value is more than twice themarket cap of adidaskumar and under armour combined and notjust since yesterdaythe company from oregon has beendominating its competitorssince the 90s how did nike manage todisplacethe german sportswear giants adidas andpumawhat strategy kept them on top fordecades and what have they planned forthe futurewe take a deeper look into the strategyof the strongest sports brand in theworld[Music]for a long time the sportswear marketwas dominated by german brandsadidas and puma were the big names hadall the resources andknow-how and it didn't look like thiswould change very soonbut phil knight had a different ideaafter graduating from the university oforegon he enrolled at stanford for anmbabeing a competitive runner himself hefollowed his interests and wrote a paperwith the titlecan japanese sports shoes due to germansports shoeswhat japanese cameras did to germancamerashis ambition was to import high qualityand low-cost running shoes from japanwherelabor was cheaper into the americanmarket and that's exactly what he didafter his graduation he traveled tojapan and met with onitsuka taigathe company that would later launchessex impressed by the quality and lowcost of their running shoesknight managed to secure thedistribution rights for the westernunited statesand ordered his first samples whenknight finally received the first shoesafter more than a year of waitinghe mailed two pairs to his former trackcoach bill bowerman at the university oforegonhoping to gain both a sale and aninfluential endorsementtonight's surprise bauermen not onlyordered the shoesbut also offered to become a partner andprovide product design ideasthe two men agreed to a partnership byhandshake and blue ribbon sports wasbornthe company that would later become nikethe founding story already reveals someimportant factors that explain the riseof nikefirst phil knight showed stronganalytical skills by realizing thepotential in outsourcing the productionto japanmaybe even more significant were nike'sroots in sportsto be precise in running like the twoco-foundersmany of the first employees were formerrunnersthey sold their first running shoes tobefriended athletes oftenright on the track one of them was steveprefontainewho was a huge star in oregon at thetime and went on to become nike's firstsponsored track athletesoon people realized that the fastestrunners were suddenly not wearing adidasshoes anymorebut this new local brand knight and histeam quickly realized they had foundtheir perfect marketing strategy whileadidas was close to officials andputting their money on organizationslikefifa and the ioc nike was close toathletesand rather invested in individuals thaninstitutionsthe idea of creating a shoe brand fromathletesfor athletes was also shown in theirhands on research and developmentaside from an intensely competitivemindset bowerman displayedfascination with optimizing the shoes ofhis athletes in the early 1970soregon's hayward field where bauermanworked for yearswas transitioning from a crushed cindertrack to an artificial surfaceand bowerman was searching for a runningshoe that would be suitable for multiplesurfaceswhile watching his wife making wafflesin their kitchen he had his eurekamomenthe simply molded some plastic and pouredit into his wife's waffle ironthat completely ruined the iron but itsgrooves turned out to be a near perfectmould for a running shoebowerman's waffle trainer set aprecedent for nike's culture to innovateand to redefine the status quo andsports equipmentit was the first of many majorinnovations that helped nike gainand expand the lead on its competitorsinventions and designs like air soulsthe air force onenike3 and flyknit followed andrevolutionized the sneaker industrythe latest example is the nike vapourfly running shoethat made headlines because it isliterally making you run fasterit was initially developed to helpelliot kipchogebreak the two-hour barrier for themarathon which he did in 2019 in viennathat event and the fact that nikerunners have dominated the major racesin recent years led the world athleticsassociation to releasenew rules to regulate running shoesbanning shoesbecause they increase performance that'sa similar story to the nba banningmichael jordan's air force onenike couldn't have wished for bettermarketing elliot kipchoge and michaeljordan are just two names from a longlist of nike athletes what started withprefontainequickly developed into the most valuablesport portfolio in the worldother big names of that list carl lewistiger woodsserena williams ronaldinho roger federerlebron james and cristiano ronaldoand the other ronaldo the roster ofathletes clubs and federationsis the heart of the nike brand which isone of the strongest in the world amongall industries their marketing strategyhas been praised many timesfrom their iconic swoosh logo and justdo its sloganto multiple advertisements that have wonemmysbut what's just as interesting as themarketing strategy itselfis how the organization behind thatmachinery worksnike is a so-called matrix organization[Music]that means that employees report to morethan one supervisorfor example if you are a sales managerfor footwearyou might report to the sales directorand the director of footwearthe departments in the matrixorganization can work closely togetherand communicate more frequently toresolve issuesthis frequent information exchangeallows managers to respond quickly tothe needs of the customersand nike's business goals nike's matrixwas previously structured to developmarket and sell based on product typethis allowed them to be efficient insupply chain and manufacturingbut it did not address the needs of theconsumer so in 2008nike made a change to organize based onsportsinstead of products an approach theycalled category offensenike's categories include among othersrunningglobal football basketball and trainingthis change has proven very successfulas sales have grown by70 percent to over 30 billion dollarssince the realignmentmaybe you have even seen the effect ofthe category offense yourself in a storenear youas a market leader nike had so muchinfluence on their retail partnersthat stores changed their layouts tobuild entire sections of the storearound each of nike's sports categoriesthese sections featured footwear appareland equipment tailored to each specificsportmaking the shopping experience moreconvenient for the consumerthe change led to increases in overallspending for multi-sport consumers whonow had a large selection of merchandisefor each of their sportsso instead of owning one pair of shoesto use for bothrunning and the gym people now buy onepair of running shoesand one pair of training shoes thecategory orphan's model has evenimproved nike's financial reporting andplanningnow nike tracks financial performance bysports categoryand is able to make targeted investmentsin the struggling categoriesfor example if they see a decline insales of football bootsthey could decide to sign a footballclub to stimulate salesit is a perfect example how nike usedtheir influence as a market leader tochange the sports industryfrom a focus on product silos to sportscategoryit explains how the company defended andexpanded the lead over adidas and pumain recent yearsbut what are nike's plans for the futuretheir strategic outlookmight be even more interesting thantheir past accomplishmentsafter the category offense in 2008nike's leadership decided that it istime for another strategy changein 2017. they announced the consumerdirect offense with a goal to betterserve the consumer personally at scalethat sounds very fancy but basicallymeans that they want to sell more onlinevia their own

you look at the history of professionalbasketball in Philadelphia Philadelphia76er went to the championship in 1977and lost to the Portland Trailblazerswent to the championship in 1980 andlost to the Los Angeles Lakers and theygot Moses Malone for 1982-1983 seasonand prior to that season Moses Malonewas wearing the franchise white Nike redswoosh perfect almost perfect 1982 who'sKilgore came up with the Nike Air ForceOne and blessed Moses Malone with thatshoe and in turn he blessed the citywith the championship in 1983so that shoe means a lot to this citybecause most Malone was that one playerPhiladelphia Sixers for one player awayand then it was Moses Moses came and hedelivered two Philadelphians to thepromised landit's called pho pho phone you say thatanywhere in the city you're 25 or olderand you like basketball you know whatthat meansfo fo-fo that's the Air Force one andthat is what Moses Malone proclaimswould be the record for 76 it was sweetfour zero four is the number and theyswept to Los Angeles Laker four games tozero the rest is historyat the time that the Air Force one hitPhiladelphia Philly was all about ballPhilly we played hard and we know how toplay and I'm not hating on the othercity cuz there's great players all overthe world but fully we do it big hereand it reflects the sneaker of the timeNike Air Force One and I say forcebecause that's what you got on the courtthe major innovation with Air Force oneis obviously in the title of the shoeitself you know the air technology Imean when we first heard there was airshoes I mean it was kind of incredible Idon't think any of us really believedthat there was air inside there and Iremember the one advertisement the AirForce One and the sole of the shoe wascutaway and did the diagram and you canactually see inside of it and they saidit was air you got to understand brosneakers made in the 70s or early 80s Imean we're really really hard on yourfeet I mean a more important thingreally at that point what used to besocks you know you look at old picturesyou see a lot of brothers with threefour sometimes five pairs of socksbecause that's what gave you yourcushioning on the concrete but when theAir Force one came out all of a suddenyou could wear one pair sock basketballshoes before 1982 we're not in modernterms comfortable they didn't offer thatcomfort or that that support thatplayers need you took a player in 2006put them in a shoe saying 80 80 81 shoethey'd be lucky if they lasted a quarterand you knowa quarter and a shoe like that theendurance and the stamina of the shoeall of a sudden changed that was therock him that's that was like what youknow raised the bar of what sneakerscould be the unique thing about Nike AirForce one is they went from being abasketball specific shoe with air a newshoe with air to issue that nowculturally is accepted worldwide peopleon other planets where Air Force OnesMartians wear Air Force one we startedselling Air Force Ones 1982 sold prettygood the guys like the soles they likejust a look of it I think what wouldreally made it was the thickness of thesole the strap they like the word air onitjust the beefiness that's the the lookthat they wanted there's a nice basiclooking shoe not too many colors if youhave the Air Force Oneyou were the Shi take back then eightytwo shoes had what they call it a runshoes will come out be out for a certainamount of time and they go awaykids in Baltimore in particular at thatpoint in time after the Air Force onehad its initial run was still coming tothe stores like you always you know canI get them once gotta get those AirForce One three retailers known as thethree amigos picked up on that havemeetings with Nike as I look why don'tyou bring back this shoot you hadCharlie Rudo sports downtown locker roomand Cinderella shoes it was Harold brutoand myself who came up with this idea ofresurrecting the Air Force one visitmeeting and I told him I wanted to bringin the Air Force Ones who would take todo it they thought we were crazythey said you guys but I believed in youguys you guys are crazy enough to askweren't were crazy enough to make it wewere forced to take twelve hundred pairof each color a white royal blue and awhite chocolate brown we took them wesold them right out the Air Force Onewas reborn this was unprecedentedwe started doing a program with Nike adifferent color each month that's whatthe shoe that my thing came fromBaltimore kids were feeling for thisshoe every month come in they're buyingevery different color where they can getthey would come up to me a paw you thinkyou can make a sky blue yeah we havethat already in the works that took itto another level this is something thatnever been done beforeback then you had almost an internetbetween New York Philadelphia Baltimoreyou had the i-95 corridor I 95 freewayexpressway link these three cities nextthing you know cats in Philadelphia inNew York getting a form oh what's goingon Baltimore and vice versa when wefound out where they were we went ohyeah people were coming down from NewYork buying shoes people were comingfrom DC buying shoes from us so the wordgot around pretty quick and it wouldhave 15 colors like Air Force Ones inWindows one all of those three timesthat's what it was we knew it wasworking we were rocking he just spreadlike wildfire this is withoutadvertising this is without nike makinga big push this is by word of mouth thisis through that internet connection thatthat preceded the digital technology byyou know decades that's where thegenesis of this whole rebirth of the AirForce one came from yeah you never knowyou sometimes you just can't figure itout it's it's like being in Las Vegasand you have the dice in your hand andyou're rolling it you just don't knowI remember I'll never forget that momentI walked into the store and I saw thesesneakers and I picked them up off thewall and I was like yo what the what artis itI was I was intrigued I wasn't sold onthem right off the bat until I waterit was the ball-playing community thatwore those sneakers off the back to playball and then it started spilling oncourt could I remember a time when wewore basketball clothes all day longlike anonyme gym shorts and everywherewe went and we had sneakers on gymshorts and a Jersey or a tank topbecause we played ball that's that's howwe live let me let me make a connectionfor you like basketball and hip-hop theythere's so intertwined it's not evenfunny like before hip-hop came along itwas nothing but basketball when we wereplaying ball like we were listening toto rap music you know and the guys thatwere involved in hip-hop you know theylove basketball a lot and play ball sothe relationship between hip-hop and andand sports period but mainly basketballis really tight into rolling meatparticularly in my life and I hadn'tgone hip-hop I'd have been a ball playerjust do it baby you know so there'salways been that connection of likehip-hop basketball New Yorkand the Styles mesh you know walkinghere is a very functional part of livingin New York you know so if you're gonnawalk you know say what do you want to beseen in the New York kid weather whetherhe's walking to school or walking towork or walking to his cornerwhatever whatever job he's doing youunderstand comfort is key the componentsis key and the bragging rights that theshoe gives you walking up the block iskey people that look down at your feetyou know I mean in New York you knowpeople eye contact after we get to knowyou but before that it's like yeahwhat's up and people

is going on with this suit whatdoes it mean for sneakerheads in generalis it illegal to modify a consumerproduct and resell itdoes this mean that you can't sellmodified nikes anymore or any other kindof modified clothingwell we're going to get into all of thattoday because this is a fascinating casethatjust involves just about everything butfirst a point of clarification because alot of people think that this caseinvolves copyright and that's simply notthe case there are generally three kindsofintellectual property or ip that peoplethink about there's copyright patent andtrademarkcopyright involves things that areexpressivethings like art books tv shows moviesthat gets copyright protectionthen there's patents that tends to coveruseful items things likeinventions and then finally that leavestrademark which is meant to protect theconsumer public it's meant to uh showpeople where things came from bycreating brands so that they knowthe source of the things that they arebuying and in order to qualify fortrademark protection under federal lawa trademark has to meet three basicrequirements one the trademark has to bedistinctive of the source of the goodsor servicesto which it is affixed number two thetrademark must not bedisqualified from protection by variousstatutory bars to protectionnumber three the trademark has to beused in commercethe purpose of trademark is to identifythe source of goods to ensure thatconsumers actually know where theirproducts come from in other wordstrademark holders get protection frompeople and companies who would sellknock-off goods it's all aboutprotecting the consumer publicand that's what this whole lawsuit isabout nike has invested billions ofdollars into its brand and is trying toprotect the strengthof the swoosh and the nike word mark sothat people aren't confusedand people don't think that nike createdsome shoes that are endorsed by satanyou can sort of understand where they'recoming from on that and in nike'slawsuit it immediately dissociatesitself from the satan's shoesmischief is currently taking orders forthe shoes it refers to as the satanshoes which are customized nike air max97 shoes that mischief has materiallyaltered to prominently feature a satanicthemethis was done without nike's approval orauthorization and nike is in no wayconnected to this projectso nike brings a bunch of claims and thefirst of which is garden varietytrademark infringement in violation of15 usc1114 and nike claims that mischiefproducts violated nike's trademarkby manufacturing and selling satan'sshoes so how do you prove trademarkinfringement well to prevail on a claimof trademark infringement a company hasto showone it owns a valid trademark number twothat the defendant used the trademark incommerce without the company's consentand three the defendant's use created alikelihood of consumer confusion the keyelementis the third one that there is alikelihood that a consumer will beconfused about the source of the goodsand nike objects that it has no controlover the nature and quality of thesatan's shoes and that it has areputation and goodwillthat will be damaged if mischief keepsselling these modified nikesand consumers are likely to be confusedby the shoes and any defects objectionsor faults with the shoes thatmight hurt nike's reputation and nike ofcourse especially objects to the bloodin the midsolewhich could pose a risk of harm to theconsumer but this isn't yourgarden-variety trademark infringementcase where some nefarious competitoris creating another product andintentionally creating it in a waythat's confusing to peoplecreating a bunch of shoes that have acheck mark on it that kind of looks likea nike swooshinstead mischief actually bought nikesthey were originally nikes it's justthat theymodified them after the fact whichbrings up the most common defense in acase like this which is called the firstsale doctrinewhen people started hearing about thisnike suit a lot of people were worriedthat that meant thatif nike can sue you you can't buy aconsumer good and thenresell it let's say used on ebay ormaybe resell it newon amazon but generally the first saledoctrine means that it's legal for anindividual to resell atrademarked item after it has been soldby the trademark owner in an authorizedsaleso when you buy an authentic pair ofnikes you can usually do what you wantwith them in factanytime you buy a branded good itbecomes yoursif you want to buy a book and later sellit on ebay the author can't stop youyou can keep it forever and maybe giveit to goodwill sell it on ebay or throwit in a like it's yours to do with whatyou wantand trademark law is supposed to protectconsumers from being deceived about theorigin of a productare consumers confused when they buy thegenuine article with an authentictrademarkgenerally no they're not and that's whya mark holder can't stop you fromresellinga used item that's the whole purpose ofthe first sale doctrine and there are acouple of exceptions to the first saledoctrine for the purposes of nike'slawsuit the most important one applieswhen the products soldare materially different from thecompany's authorized productnike says that its shoes were materiallyaltered to prominently feature asatanic theme and so how do you provematerial difference well in 2020one court described it this way analteration is material if it changessomething about the product that isrelevant to a consumer's decision topurchasethat product that quote is from a casewhere maui jim the sunglass manufacturersued someone who was reselling theirsunglasses but theyremoved the lenses from the frames andreplaced them with different lensesgenerally either plano lenses orprescription lensesthe problem from maui jim's perspectivewas that they had patented the lenses topromise to wipe out glare and uv raysand the skin cancer foundationofficially recommended the maui gems asan effective uv filter for the eyes andsurrounding skinso maui jim didn't want people buyingthesemodified sunglasses without theprotections that they had designedinto their original glasses and maui jimsuccessfully argued that by replacingthe lenses with something elsethe this reseller had removed somethingthat factored into a person's decisionto buy maui jimframes so to bring it back around to thesatan shoes nike is arguing thatconfusion has already resulted becausethisunauthorized reseller and modifier ofshoes is offering original nike shoeswithout the associated benefits thatnike customers expect andit has been materially modified nikesays that adding an extra substance likeblood to the midsole of the shoecould pose safety risks to the consumerand of course nike also implies thatlots and lots of consumers are disgustedby the ideas of shoes with blood in themand yeah if you're selling nike airshoes they're supposed to have an airpocket in the sole of the shoe and it'sactually filled with liquid regardlessof whatever that liquid isthat kind of seems like a materialdifference but nike's second claim isfor false designation of origin which isgenerally a fancy name for consumerconfusionaccording to nike consumers are alreadybeing misled into believing that nikewas deliberately promoting satan's shoesthe company can cite hundreds of postsfrom christians who are now questioningwhether nike is promoting satan they canalso findplenty of people who object to havingshoes made with blood in themand i have to admit when i first saw theheadlines for this case i thought nikehad manufactured the shoesthere's a prominent white nike swoosh ona black shoei thought that nike had done thiscollaboration and as nike saysas an innovative brand that strives topush the envelope and do the right thingnike knows it may not please everyone atall time but decisions about whatproducts to put the swoosh on belong tonikebut on the other hand generally whenyou're talking about consumer confusionyou're talking about point of saleconfusion that the people who bought theactual productswere misled into thinking that there wassome association there and it's actuallysort of unlikely that the over 600people that boughtthe modified shoe thought that nike hadcreated the shoeit seems like they knew that mischiefwas the one that modified those shoesso it's hard to argue that they theconsumers the direct consumers of theseshoes were confused in any other waythough on the other other hand nikewould argue thatregardless of whether these consumerswere confused downstream consumersthe public at large will think that nikehad something to do with his satan shoesand thus potentially notbuy nike shoes in the future and then weget to nike's third and myfavorite trademark related claim one fortrademark dilutionand i know i joke on this channel a lotabout claims being particularly sexybut this claim is actually literallysexy and we'll get to that in just asecondbut in 1996 congress enacted the federaltrademark dilution actwhich made it possible for mark holdersto obtain injunctions against the use oftheir markseven if there is no traditionaltrademark infringement and the ftdagives certain mark holders the right tosue when a third party uses a markin commerce in such a way that it hurtsconsumer perception ofa famous mark and there are generallytwo kinds of dilution there's blurringand there's tarnishmentand blurring is when a famous mark'sdistinctiveness is harmed because itbecomes or is likely to becomeassociated with a similar mark in adifferent context so for exampleif rolex was suddenly stamped on golfballs andhot dogs in addition to watches thenthere would be blurring of that mark youmight associate rolex with hot dogsinstead offancy watches and tarnishment on theother hand happens when the famousmark's reputation is harmedthrough an association it tarnishmentcreates a harm to a famous mark byassociating it with something that woulddamage that reputation so normallythat's when a famous mark is linked withsomething that is considered offensivelike pornography or drug use and courtsare especially hard on expressions thatlink a product tosex i told you we were going to getactually sexy with this legal claimso for example barbie won a case againsta porn company that wanted to havebarbie in their urland the dallas cowboy cheerleaders won acase against the movie www's dallasbecauseit used dallas cowboy cheerleader styleoutfits ina very adult film and a website was notallowed to use the domain namecandyland.com to identify porn sitebecause it tarnished and diluted thehasbro candyland trademark associatedwith its board gamesbut if the subject is not sex thencourts are not completely consistent inhow they decidewhether there is actual tarnishment anddilution so for example in one caseparodies involving dog chew toys wereprotected speechthe ninth circuit held that a squeakingdog toy resembling a bottle of jackdaniel's whiskeyis an expressive work entitled to firstamendment protection while a virginiacourt held that louis vuitton's mark wasnot tarnished by a company sellingchewy futon squeaky dog toys but on theother hand dr seuss was able to stoppublication of an o.j simpson trialparody book calledthe cat not in the hat by dr juice thecourt found a likelihood of confusionand stopped publication that caseinvolved both copyright and trademarkaspects you really could write a wholebook on howdr seuss enterprises vigorously defendsits rights throughlawsuits but in contrast the banned aquawas victorious in a battle with mattelover the song barbie girlwhere the ninth circuit held that thesong about barbie did not turn barbieinto a sex object nor didits lyrics tarnish barbie's reputationbut nike claims that mischief's wrongfuluse of the nike asserted marks inconnection with his satanic imagery islikely to cause dilution bytarnishment which understandably couldtheoretically damagenike's reputation and as i said courtstake a very puritanical view when itcomes to associations with sexbut we don't know exactly what thecourt's going to think about usingsatanic imagery on a shoe whether that'soffensive or unsavory in the same waythat pornography or criminality would bebut nike probably has a decent chance ofprevailing on thisso let's talk about mischief's defenseshere in its response to nike's motionfor temporary restraining order whichi'll get to in a few momentsmischief says that nike cannot showconfusion among sophisticated purchasersof sneakerswho all knew all along that this was acollab between lil nas x and mischiefwith no nike involvement but nike'scounter to this is that nike's logois all over the shoes in question and asfor nike's claim that its brand is beingtarnished by an association with satanmischief argues about the prior shoesthat it created it created a lineof jesus shoes white shoes with crossiconography and filled withsupposedly blue holy water and says thatthose shoes were not universallyembracedbut nike didn't try and enforce theirrights against that particularmodified shoe and on the contrary manypeople were outraged by thethese jesus shoes and labeled them assacrilegiousand like nike mischief has tweetsbacking up its position and here's onepointing out that nike is named for thegreek goddess of victory which at leastone twitter user found to be offensiveand here's one saying that the jesusshoes made the user sick and he intendedto throw awayall of his nike gear so nike can't winwith associations with other non-satanicdeities and mr's point here is that theycan probablyfind tweets hammering nike no matterwhat choice they make andpeople have criticized nike formanufacturing sneakers in china but whennike criticized china's forced laborcamps earlier this year chinesecelebrities publicly cut ties with thecompanyso nike is frequently the subject ofdebate and controversythose who are convinced nike is ahorrible company are unlikely to beswayed by the satan's shoesand that of course brings us to thefirst amendment because just becausesomething is a trademark or is involvedin commerce doesn't mean that you giveup all first amendment rightstrademarks of course are meant toprotect against consumer confusionbut in recent years courts areincreasingly likely to find that thefirst amendment protects speech evenwhen it might naturally result in someconfusionand that's a good thing for artists likelittle nas x and mischief nike of courseclaims that the satan's shoes are not apieceof art and were not created by artistsand are just purely a commercial venturesaying well mischief has a firstamendment right to criticizediscriminatory social normsthose norms have nothing to do with thenike swoosh and the nike word mark butat base there's clearly some tensionbetween trying toprotect trademarks and one's firstamendment right to expressionwhich takes us to the parody defensejust asfair use is a defense to copyrightinfringement parody is a defense tosome kinds of trademark dilution claimsbut parity in the trademark context isnot easy to provethe elements that you have to show areone in original host work too theoriginal work must be famous or wellknown within the particular targetaudienceand three the creator of the derivativework the parody must take only so muchof the original work as is necessary tobring to mind the original host workand for the derivative work whichconjures up the famous mark must resultin a neworiginal work so let's break this downfurther this is difficult in thiscontext because the parody has to bemaking funof a real product here nike shoes itcan't just be a parody of something elselikereligion for example and it has to beobvious to consumers that the parody ismaking a comment on the real productand the second message must be somethinglike yes these are authentic nike shoesand isn't nike ridiculous with the waythey use their brandso there has to be an element of satirejoking or reverend commentary that theconsumer would understand and this is areally interesting issue formischief because as we talked aboutbefore a traditional trademark casecares about confusion at the point ofsale where the people who bought thesatan's shoes confused at all about thesourceprobably not the buyers knew thatmischief had created a parody making funof nike itself the argument being thatthey're making fun of all thecollaborations that nike is willing todo that they'll basically collaboratewith anyone evenjesus or satan and there are collectorswhoare well aware of what mischief does infact they may even be aware thatmischief once made jesus shoes with holywater in the midsole andnike didn't object and the jesus shoe isinteresting because it added a goldenjesus on a crucifix as a shoelace charmandmischief also sourced holy water fromthe river jordan which was apparentlyblessed by a priest in brooklynand added it to the soul of the shoe andin a press releasemischief founder said that he wascommenting on the ridiculouscollaborations that nike has done weasked ourselves what would a shoe collabwith jesus actually look like obviouslyit would let you walk on water well howcan we do that you pump holy water intothe pocket ofair of the air max 97s and with that youget the jesus shoethe holiest collab ever and that makesthe jesus shoe and the satan shoes feelmorelike a parody maybe the satan shoebuyers were aware of this history ofweird collabs and even saw satan's shoesas an extension of the earlier jesusshoescouncil for mischief expanded on thisargument in the company's tro letterwhere mischief argues that the shoesaren't mocking religion they aremocking nike's reputation and nike is atonce a global iconin a company with a reputation for shadybusiness practices likemaking shoes using chinese sweatshopsand collaborating with just about anyoneto make a buck butthis logic may not hold up in court nikecan respond by saying that surethe 666 consumers who purchased theshoes weren't confused but everyone elseon the internet surely was and thesepeople matter becausethey are future nike consumers who arenow confused they are literally sayingoh no nike loves satani have to burn my nikes again and thattakes us to the motion for a temporaryrestraining ordernike was lightning fast with thislawsuit filing almost the next day afterthe shoes were releasedand the day after that nike moved for atemporary restraining order or aninjunctionto prevent mischief from doing anythingrelated to the shoes basicallynike wanted a temporary and permanentinjunctive to preventmischief from manufacturing transportingpromoting advertising publicizingdistributing ordering for sale orselling any products including but notlimited to the satan shoes under nikemarksand or any marks substantiallyindistinguishable they're fromnow we've talked about tros a lot onthis channelgenerally the court only will issue thisemergency relief when there isirreparable harm that cannot be undoneby the courtgenerally the idea is if you can becompensated with money evenlong after the fact that's notirreparable harmbut ip is an area where courts oftenfindirreparable harm it's harm to one'sreputation or brand that cannot beundone and that's what nike is sayinghere that their brand is being tarnishedby an association with satanand you can't really undo that after thefact but mischief argues that thisis inappropriate because mischief hasalready shipped 665 of its 666 pairs ofshoeswith only one pair being held back for alater raffle but it contends that sincethe shoes have already shipped they'vegone outemergency relief shouldn't be grantedwell nike responded that even if thecompany did shipall but one of the pairs of shoes thetro would still be necessary toprevent that one other pair of shoesgoing out and to preventmischief from benefiting from thisharmful and tarnishinguh action that they've taken againstnike and nike accuses mischiefprobably correctly of quickly shippingthe orders to circumvent thepossible incoming tro and to add injuryto insult mischief is now selling at-shirtbearing the front page of nike'scomplaint on the shirt that issome creative marketing there and ofcourse nike accused mischief ofdeliberately trying to stir upcontroversy by promoting the t-shirt andgoing forward with the shoe saledespite having noticed that nikebelieved that this was trademarkinfringement but at the same time nikedidn'ttechnically notify mischief by letter orphone call that it objected to the shoesthe company just simply went forwardwith the lawsuit on the same dayof the sale but just like nike the courtmoved lightning fast and within a dayissued a temporary restraining orderpreventing mischief from really doinganything related to the shoes buthere it's hard to unring the bell theshoes are out mischief hasreally benefited from all of thepublicity that it has gotten related tothe satan's shoesand the associations have been made nowthe court hasn't made a determinationon the merits a final one it found thatnike was likely to prevail ifthis indeed goes forward but mischiefwill be able to presentall of its arguments even those relatedto the first amendment issuesuh in briefing related to a preliminaryinjunction and eventuallythe trial itself but if you want toshoot a satan-themed music video

you don't have to be a rocket scientistto know that America under Trump is morepoliticized than everbecause although this country has alwayshad his issues people used to be able toescape by turning off the news but nowpolitics is just like a track featuringcardi B it's everywhere you go and justthis week politics even reached the moonthis morning a controversy over RyanGosling's upcoming movie first man itexplores the life of astronaut NeilArmstrong the first man to walk on themoon but the film is coming under fireweeks before its release for a momentfrom that historic mission that isn'tshown the film which premiered Thursdayat the Venice Film Festival does notinclude that famous moment where theAmerican flag is planted on the moon'ssurface several conservatives are evenpushing for a possibly a boycott of thefilm but actor Ryan Gosling who playsArmstrong defended the decision bysaying that Armstrong's moonwalktranscended countries and borders thiswas widely regarded in the end as ahuman achievement I don't think the neoviewed himself as an American Hero okayRyan Gosling is such a beautiful idiotsall rightlike when Neil Armstrong stepped on themoon he didn't say this is a giant leapfor mankindhe said one small step for man america[ __ ] yeah[Music]you didn't hear it cuz of the vacuum inspace now honestly like I don'tunderstand why conservatives are soangry that they're planning to boycott amovie about America landing on the moonbecause apparently there are Americanflags throughout this movie right theyjust didn't show the exact moments thatArmstrong placed the American flag onthe moon but no one is gonna walk out ofthat movie and be like wait were thoseastronauts Korean I couldn't tell andalso on the other side I don't thinkthat Ryan Gosling is right all right Idon't think that it wasn't an Americanthing the moon landing was very much anAmerican thing and to be honest there'ssomeone from the rest of the world wedon't want credit for America's moonlanding right cuz I don't know whathappened up therewe saw the astronauts come down theyplanted the flag and then the video cutsoff all right all we know as soon asthat clip ended they did a genocide ofall the native moon people this hasburied them in a mass grave somewhere onthe dock side of the Moon and thensomeday the moon people are gonna comedown to earth and be like you guys didthis to us and we'd be like god no wedidn't do that the Americans did it canyou see the flag[Applause]but still but still either way manyconservatives have said that they willbe boycotting this movie and

become fashion statementsthe two brands are the biggest of theirkindalthough Sporting Goods newbee UnderArmour has threatened to take thenumber-two spot in the u.s. at least buton a global scaleUnder Armour can't compete just yet withthese two behemoths right now the focusof the leading two brands is China's 415million Millennials maybe we'll have abetter idea of who will take over Chinaafter today's episode of the infographicshow Nike vs. Adidas don't forget tosubscribe and click the bell bone to theyou can be part of our notificationsquad let's first have a look at howthese two companies got off the groundNike is an incredible success storygiven that before it appeared on thescene Adidas and Puma owned the marketNike changed that pretty quickly thecompany was founded on January 25th 1964when businessman Phil Knight and trackcoach / running shoe enthusiast BillBowerman got together to build theperfect and affordable athletics shoeprior to its independence Nike thencalled Blue Ribbon sports or BRSoperated under Japanese Sporting Goodsfirm Tiger which is now known as Asicsin 1966 BRS opened its first store andin 1971 it changed its name to Nike andalso created the swoosh most everybodyknows of today that swoosh cost Nike 35bucks to design and was created by aPortland State University graphic designstudent Nike took off as fast as itsrunners and by 1980 it had half of theu.s. athletic shoe market in the late80s and 90s Nike began its globaldominance and its products are nowavailable in virtually every country inthe world in undeveloped nations if youdon't see a Nike store you will stillfind people wearing the products adidasstarts as a family story the founderAdolph Destler began making shoes in hismother's kitchen at the same time hisbrother Rudolph was working with theirfather at a footwear factory later thebrother started working together at the1936 Olympics in Germany young AdolfDestler made a great move by findingAmerican sprinter Jesse Owens andconvincing him to wear the spiked shoeshe had made Owens won four golds andAdolf and his brother almost immediatelybecame famous all over the world by 1939the two brothers werejuicing and selling around 200,000 pairsof shoes a year at the time the shoeswere simply products of the Dasslerbrothers shoe factory that would soonchange in 1947 the brothers split on notvery good terms Adolph Destler named hiscompany Adidas and his brother RudolfDasslerstarted a company called rue de whichlater became Puma a household name todaynow let's look at some numbers Nikenamed after the Greek goddess of victorylives up to its nameit's currently on Forbes list as thebiggest sporting goods company in theworld forbes put the value of nike at 27billion dollars for the year 2016 adidasis in third place

gonnabuy some more Nike stuff for some peoplethey make a big issue over little thingsthat's wrong if you sit down during thenational anthem and you don't stand upbut this kneeling down it's okay when Iwas teaching and I had students whoweren't gonna say the Pledge I askedthem to step outside we will all standand show respect to the country and youcan do that in private it's notdisrespecting your country if you areusing it as a form of protest we havethat right the video showing peopleovercoming physical challenges isamazing I'm not behind him he has nophysical handicap and yet he's using hisfootball and his football Fame toprotest something that is very very dearto many people so campaign caused manyto weigh in on social media right so wedo have a few of those responses to showI bet I bet they're both positive andnegative first the NFL forces me tochoose between my favorite spot in mycountry I choose country then Nikeforces me to choose between my favoriteshoes in my country since when did theAmerican flag and the national anthembecome offensive I'm gonna go with thisguy they didn't buy Nike to begin withbut I'd be less inclined to buy them nowhe's got a very good point there they'retrying to mix two different things that- andone shouldn't have any effect on theother I really don't see anything wrongwith it it's like a respect and you knowwhen you go and pray to God you kneeldown I think there's nothing wrong withit so you will destroy something ratherthan give it to someone who needs it Idon't understand why people feel thatthat's a choice there's a lot of sickpeople around and that they're notunderstanding what he did or why he didthey just looking at what our King KingTrump is saying throwing this in thefire this is a Colin Kaepernick is nowthe face of Nike okayas his choice in the National I got them[Music]well you're an idiot I think this thisis dumb this is a dumb reaction Oh Godgive it to me give me I'll give it to myson five pairs of shoes

seems alittle wasteful I saw man just cut theNike switch off his socksformer Marine get ready and Nikemultiply that by the millions kind oflike that I think that makes a littlemore sense big deal they already soldthem and made money Wyeth why shouldthey care just means that eventuallysomebody will come around and buy morethat's an idea if you think America'sveterans deserve more respect why notdonate your clothes to a veteran'scharity instead of cutting them up withscissors like a dumb spiteful littlebrat I'm with you Matthew amen I agreegood idea I like that I can't seeturn up good shoes for their Nike or youknow from JC Penney's for pete's sakestop using the mm excuse to burn yourNikes I'm not your scapegoat I'm gonnasit over here and continue to buy myNike stuff they give

thinks that it'sa bold move and that it's going to bringsome negative reactions as well as somepositive ones Kelly Clarkson to thankyou stood a one thank you Nike forsimply backing what you believed in oneof the best parts about this country isthe freedom we have to express ourselvesthat's right 16 years ago today thepeople of America changed my life and Iwill be forever grateful andappreciative well now that's thepositivity that we need in the worldmy aunt Kelly she's wide awake what shehas in mind is what I have in mind -it's a free countryBill O'Reilly oh I can hardly wait tohear what ya

myquestion for Nike mister Kaepernick woresocks mocking Muslims or gays would hirehim to endorse your products well nowthere's an interesting connection nowwe're mocking so this is mockable thisis a mockable offense now okay hmmthat's more muckraking I don't careabout the negative why spend all thatnegative energy I'm being negative aboutsaying negative things Serena Williamsespecially proud to be part of the Nikefamily today hashtag just do it it's apositive message this Nike is puttingout everyone has a right to say whatthey believe in and the harder youbelieve in it stand tall with it I justAM standing tall with I think this isthe wrong move for Nike if we look athistory I mean let's try to remember the1968 Olympics they won medals and theystood on the platform and they raisedtheir hand in a and Black Power salutein protest of what was going on in thecountry and people just I think theylost their medals for that it's freespeech you have the right to state anopinion has often said the message ofkneeling is a peaceful protest to endpolice brutality and racial inequalitybut many still feel that these protestsare potentially anti-american andagainst the flag and the national anthemand the US military mm-hmm I would agreewith the latter if he thinks thatkneeling is going to be something that'sgonna stop all those things that hethinks it controls or can control he'sdead wrong and I think he has a right todo thatand he shouldn't have been uh ostracizedlike he was for doing that simple acteven though it was a stupid simple actI've waited on these issues notablyPresident Trump who frequently discussesthese issues he in my opinion he shouldbe supporting what they're protestingabout and in his position doingsomething about it some of the owners ofthe National Football League have beenbuzzing a policy banning players fromkneeling though many have violated thispolicy in the preseason and some NFLowners have even volunteered to pay anyfines given out related to this policyright good for them they're just tryingto say that you need to pay attention tothese things that are going on the worldand we need to correct them for youpersonally where do you stand on theprotests during the national anthem I donot agree with the protest during thenational anthem he can head up somethingthat that would be more in tune with hisviews his ideas and do it in a settingthat's appropriate this is notappropriate I don't think nobody shouldbe protesting because the issue of blackpeople being killed all the time I thinkit's our duty our responsibility tospeak out it's not only a right it's ourobligation to stand up when we seethings are wrong they choose to protestthere on that stage where they have mostof the attention of the world morepeople should be paying attention to theissue that they're protesting about youneed to show respect for the country butif you feel that you can't respect thecountry because of certain policies thatare in play you have the right toprotest I stand up I like tradition Ilike the flag I know the song by heartbut as the issue stands I do not likeNike I do not like the fact thatKaepernick has started this kneeling atthe national anthem and and taken awaymy enjoyment of a game the black protestis right but not there well thisspecific issue aside it feels liketoday's America any shoe seems to getboth liberal and conservative peoplevery upset with each other arguing andposting on social media etc they getcarried away in your experience in yourlife have you always felt that this wasthe case with both sides this polarizedor has it gotten worse over time I thinkto me it's always been this bad it'sjust that it's just more up front nowbecause of social media this is a lotmore than beforeduring my time people are fighting morepeople want to prove that they're rightwe've gone down a road of reducedcivility we used to be able to argue ina very polite and mature fashion and Ifeel like now we just have becomeyellers and screamers gotten worsebecause the president this president haspolarized our society the bad examplethat he sets going after people anybodythat opposes him anyone that speaks outhe goes out after them like a rabid dogit's built on a light or a dislike ofthe president ever since he was electedpresident there has been a massseparation about all things I do believeif we keep trying keep pushing forwardthat this will dissolve someday go backto the Nike campaign many have pointedout Kaepernick it has long beensponsored by Nike but wasn't the faceuntil now as an elder who's seen a lotof controversial campaigns over theyears what do you think this will do forNike overall long-term overall I thinkit's gonna have a negative impact justtoo far-reaching to put this kind ofnonsense out there all things areforgotten history goes on we'll havesomething big to deal with next week Ithink it would be good for them in thelong run Nike is more of a company thatrespects the long run it's gonna helpthem because I think all the people whohave destroyed their their Nikes aregonna end up going out and buying morebecause they're gonna be missing them sofinallythe NFL season kicking off this weekwhen do you see resolution to thisdispute happening and what do you thinkthat resolution will be I really don't Ihate to be cynical I really don't seeany reason there isn't Maddie it's gonnakeep on going until maybe there changesin the end the government I don't seeresolution this is a high-poweredmulti-billion dollar industry and Ithink what what's going to affect itmost are our ticket sales and Watchersand people of buy season tickets it'sgoing to end in a stalemate Nike will beokay Kaepernick will be okay as far asgetting back into pro football I got afeeling that might not happen ourpolitical leaders ought to get involvedin this to put our country at restconcerning a national anthemif that doesn't happen then where is aleadership coming we got actors it canbe role models they should speak up theeasiest resolution is to simply have theplayers not come out until after thenational anthem is played they may befrustrated that they can't protest butthen you're not gonna have people all inhysterics about it and then maybe we'llstart discussing why people areprotesting what the real reason is thoseplayers are pretty tough and they'restanding for what they're

there's a lotof old people there are these youngpeople don't know anything they wentaround for a first time roundthere are some guys of a certain age whodon't validate that a kid can likesomething just because he likes it butmy thing is well how does it keep goingif the kid doesn't get told a story forhim to be attached to it we talked abouthanding things down when we weredesigning a new airmax we're making forthis new generation so they have theirown thing to stand with but they canlook back in the past and celebrate thatas well that's the goal for the 2090 thevisible air all started in 1978aeronautical engineer by name of FrankRudi came to fill night with this ideaof a cushioning system and it's almostweightless but it wasn't until 1987where everything changedwith their max1 the potential of whatrunning footwear could be changed thegame I fell in love with airmax ones assoon as they happen the air bubbles whatthe hell is this what the hell are theseyou can look through that shoe you couldsee the air just the red blue of course- should I get red should I get blue youwanted both you could kind of see thebeginning of what Nike was gonna becomethis innovation house was making theimpossible possible and tinkerer I thinkwas the person I set it off TinkerHatfield he's the goat Tinker Hatfieldis the sleeker Oracle the god of shoedesign tinker was in Paris and soughtour buildings he figured out how to getthat look in that idea inside of a shoebecause you have to know there was errorwhen sneakers before that there wereairships they were Air Force but theyjust said airyeah but why not just show it you knowit's not a bad idea to let peopleactually see what an air bag looks likeas a matter of fact I've got a drawinghere that actually shows what a whatshoe could look like with a visiblewindow and he'll when the idea ofexposing air started getting around atNike people started freaking out Nikethought that tinker was out of his damnmind so then it was like a hole in theshoe it wasn't an air it wasn't a holein the shoe people were like oh it's notgonna work it's impossible because youjust couldn't understand how you weregonna wear these shoes and those

youknow me and sneakers go way back I amfrom the Bronx and at school Nike was astatus symbol so you came in walkingwith some airmax of course you know youfire you got the latest but I used towatch the kids on my block simplybecause they had the fire sneakers onthere the real fashion icons for me I ama DJ I am a sneaker junkie and I am noteven from Brooklyn I just am Brooklynwhen I wore em max it was definitelywhat are you doing you have tounderstand it's not like air max tookoff when they came out not in the hoodwe were still wearing basketball shoesEmmerich's started as a running shoesure he

grewup in the coolest time 70s 80s in movinginto the 90s that was the coolest timewith cool in 1990 if I was going crazyand sneakers are part of the uniformand when you go to Europe there's MXeverywhere - you trying to figure it outyou won a half what he has and make ityour own so we claiming and we claim itwith pride MX 1 + MX 90s when that shoecame out is also around the same time Idiscovered hip-hop music the way I grewup was in a very traditional senseespecially for Asian kids like I do goodat school become a doctor become alawyer and my whole thing growing up wasgo against the grain be difficult and dowhat I love instead and maybe warningthat sneaker was one of the first stepsin that whole process we started pata VMupon the genome suite in Europe we haddifferent beds that nobody else had butI'm a DJ first from 80s till 90s up tonow so I had all these records when Ifirst saw an MX shoe was probably onsomebody's feet but when I saw it on arecord cover what are thosewhere can I get up when a subculturedecides to adopt something as their ownand that's your way to find like-mindedpeople like you're not alone we don'tearly adapt it's just typical Dutch aslike I've let's make it our own versionthen the harbor King Harbor music[Music]gabber culture goes hand in hand withhuge range like stadiums full crazy kidsgo in the heart all night and with thatstyle of

gonna destroythis thing but then you got to do itagain tomorrow and the next day andhow's this thing gonna hold up for thatall over the world music was evolvingbut I always go back to London that wasreally kind of kick off I was a kid togrow up listening to drama bass andgarage I was surrounded by that anybodywhen it came time to making our ownmusic we used the same platform as thembut then we had our own identity rightin the beginning I didn't have a namefor what I was doing I used to turn outto raves so I just wanted to just get onthe Mac so I can MC that's what it was abad but in other clubs you weren'tallowed in without shoes and a shirtwhere Graham came into the game was lackthe rebellious to that because bluecoming just straight off the street andthen eventually he took over the wholebuilding and then it became the biggestthing you'd find it hard to talk aboutgrime and not find a relevance to a maxI'm wearing them on my most iconic albumcover I didn't think it would start anold big movies where enough but from thearea people don't really walk around inblack suits that was one of the thingsyou people will cost you about if youdidn't have good trainers on you mightnot have all the money in the world butyou've got to rap here trainers on yoursomeoneliterally every artist would be wearing1995'syou see your favorite artist wearing apair of 95 you want to go out and buythose 95 this is a layered shoeit's like material type of material typeof material number two circular saw nowas the designer on that shoe he wasinspired a lot by the human anatomy therib cage attendants the muscles and hecould really see it this is the firsttime of airmax having that four foot airunit that was groundbreaking in itselfpeople are like well this is first a maxI think a black sole people are goinglike you don't do this like runningshoes have white midsole but heavy Nikehere in Portland OR shoes getting dirtywe're running trails then why not justmake this hill to into the design when95 first came out in London they werecalled the 110 because that's how muchthey costwhy do call one turns but they costhundred and ten pound people did thingsto get money and one the first thingthey did was buy a trainer there is ahuge sense of pride and where you'refrom on what you were so you'd alwayssee people wearing a full track suit anda pair of 90s or 95 like that was thelook and it still is it's not changed atall the 95 looks nothing like the 90every time a new staple air max comesout it's an entirely differentexperienceI am sneaking his story and I rememberas a kid me trying to find a way toraise $9.99 mom can I wash the dishesmom can I shovel snow mom can I dowhatever to get my shoes and if you takethe Air Max lineage and phases it's hardto sink a lot like one particular shoein the line that makes it more specialthan the other but it goes back to thedesign because it's unlike anythingbefore[Music]like asking me what my favorite airmaxis basically like asking me which childdo I like the mostbut the 97's oh that's good you this isthe first shoe to have a full-lengthairbag like when Christian Tresserdesigned that shoe he brought thatanother point of view to that water dropthere's something so subtle andbeautiful about that this is the classicI probably have six more pair of thisSilver Bullet Air Max 97 the same exactcolorwaywhat did you see I saw silver bulletswas huge in Japan the bullet train inTokyo this transportation system thatwas revolutionized the way people movedthis shoot began to do the same thingthe culture hadn't that nickname andit's

youwere doing what music you identified atthat time that will influence yoursneaker choices when you have that cleanaesthetic that's recognizable I think itbecomes a canvas for people to kind ofput there and play on it I think as soonas all these artists started coming inthis becomes this art piece for cultureto play with and say like this is how Ido itthis is basically the genesis of myworking with sneaker brands careerwith Dizzee Rascal being given his ownpair of 90s I feel like that was likethe pinnacle of crime and Londonnow that came about it must have justdone some talking and asked me if alwaysdo it and I just said yeah obviously waslaughs massive privilege like what todecide my own train on the shoewe did four pairs and it came out and itjust blew the up for us it wasbeautiful and makes one we consider itour shoot that's are you in a phonethat's Amsterdam so there would not bean adoption see the mx1 or nocollaboration for me the Air Max is seenas revolutionary it's giving visionariesof voice and I love that I was able todesign the seeker with Nike by you andwhen given this opportunity I have newstraight from the bat that I wanted toincorporate my full-time career as

office the oldMiss Liz you have some drip I havefallen in love with air max ever since Iwas a kid and the high school that Iwent to sneakers were kind of a refugefor me for me I think the most iconicsneaker that warms my heart are thelemaise claw designed by Gabrielleserrano I was born in Queens I work inthe medical field I have like youngerkids coming in and they're like oh mygod you're like the cool nurse thatwears sneakers I wanted to make it notjust a shoe about myself that's why Iended up doing all the different skintones to highlight everybody in New Yorkthe airmax even though it's meant forperformance is just taking on a wholenew evolution when you have that canvaseveryone loves it they feel connected toit the 90s was like the Golden Age ofairmaxand I think now looking back we're kindof doing let's do that again I don'tthink there's such thing as creatingicons icons just happened just like whensomebody goes I'm gonna go in the studiothat someone's gonna be a classicyou're a liar either it just happens butit doesn't happen for a sneaker tobecome an icon the people have to makeit the iconI do believe that you can take somethingiconic and make it better as long as youhave the respect for what came prior Idon't think the new generation has theirown show in that same sense that we hadour generations should encourage youngerkids to do stuff your own way we're notgrowing up in this time regardless ofwhat a designer or Nike wants to make itit's the culture that makes it what itis there's history of where airmax camefrom but it's uniquely modern anduniquely now that's what this is this isthe new generations airmax this is madefor them we kind of thought about futurecity's future of fashion reducingdistractions and this idea of simplicitynot like just doing a mash-up of tissueit what we did to create the new Air Max90 it's very sensitive balance betweenhaving something bow down on somethingfamiliar[Music]you have this duality between expressionon experience this is why people relateto the shoe this is what make Air Maxand Max we're celebrating anniversariesfor shoes that when they were makingthem they thought they were gonna goaway oh yeahthe only reason why these things keepgoing is because the story keeps gettingtold from a older guy to a younger guyto a younger guy to a younger guy and itstill looks perfect Anisa media

a long time ago sneaker technologies arebasic and not as exciting as they aretodayfor example leather basketball andtennis shoes for groundbreaking as wordtrack spikes but sometime in the mid tolate 70sevie a cushioning was born and sportsscience and shoe companies began rapidlyinnovating Nike had their waffle soleand eventually debuted air technologywith the nike air tailwind every time Iknew sneaker technology was released tothe market it seemed like something fromthe future think of shoes like theReebok pump or the adidas micro pacerwhich had a computer in it encounteredyour steps one of the most highlyanticipated sneaker technologies wasNike Shoxin this video we're going to be taking acloser look at the history of Nike Shoxtechnology but more importantly we'regoing to be answering the question whydid thankies long-awaited shocktechnology fail at a capture the marketlike nike air did hello and welcome backeveryoneif you're new here my name is Brian andmy brother nacho and I make videos onsneaker history and all things relatedto sneaker culture so if you're intosneakers then please considersubscribing to this channel because wemake content like this all the time andyou're not gonna want to miss an uploadalright guys with that out of the waylet's get into the video as early as1984 Nike was already experimenting withthe idea of placing a mechanicalcushioning system in their shoesBruce Kilgore's the designer responsiblefor the Air Force one designed this madscientist looking contraption it wasNikes first steps towards developingwhat we know today as Nike Shox afterfiguring out the perfect formula forstabilization and a running shoe withnike air technology the swoosh set outto figure out the perfect formula forenergy return shoe companies like Adidasand Reebok throw those words around alot think of adidas boosts cushioning orReeboks ers technology well what exactlyis energy return well when a person runsthat distribute energy with each strideevery time their foot hits the groundtechnologies like boost and reactionfoam take that same energy andredistribute it back to the runner whichtheoretically can make you run fasterlonger and with less fatigue the Nikedesigners were moved to create an energyreturn technology after observingrunners on a special running track atHarvard University the track was made ofpolyurethane and hadspringing nature to it it took 13 yearsto come up with the solution from 1984to 1997 Nike trialed all kinds ofexperiments but finally arrived atplacing four hollowed-out polyurethanefoam columns sandwiched in between TPUat the heels of the shoe three yearslater the long-awaited Nike Shoxtechnology debuted on the r fours in theyear 2000 the shoe retailed at 160dollars and created a lot of buzz the Rstood for running and then number fourstood for the four shock absorbers onthe heel of the shoe shortly after therelease of the R for the BV fours werereleased nike tapped the slam dunklegend Vince Carter to be the face ofNike shocks basketball line during the2000 Olympics in Sydney AustraliaVince literally leaped over seven foottwo French Center Frederick twice andone of the most soaring dunks of alltime here we are 20 years later watchingthis footage and I still can't believehe jumped over someone 7 feet luckilyfor Nike he was wearing the BBforeshocks this did two things for 91 itobviously boosted cells and 2 and moreimportantly when you saw Vince jump overthat 7 foot dude it made you think thatif you had Nike shops on your feet youcould jump that high to presents tonightVince Carter faces free mime artistswith a time bomb and seconds on theclock the minds have the bombplay harmonica use the don't fits that'sgonna hurt in the morning the BB fourwas designed by Eric a var the same dudewho designed Kobe shoes when he went toNike to me the BB four perfectly sums upthe year 2000 everyone was thinkingabout flying cars and how the future wasgoing to look the Nike shocks absorbersPlus Eric's futuristic looking uppermake this shoe an instant classic Nikecontinued to release silhouettes withshocks technology up next was the NikeShox XT which was a cross trainer thathad seven shocks columns my personalfavorite from the bunch was the NikeShox TL TL standing for total becausethe shoe from heel to toe was completelyoutfitted with shock absorbers givingyou total shock support by the mid-2000sNike Shox had fallen out of favor withthe market I'm beginning to wonder if itwas ever really in favor especially withsneaker head Nikes SP program wasbeginning to gain traction and peoplewere obsessed with the dunks by the timethe shocks traded out one interestingthing I learned from doing research forthis video is that Nike Shox actuallyhad a cult following in the UK thanks inpart to it being part of the image ofgrime hip hop Shox had a blip ofresurgence with the comms des Garconsand skeptical ABS but it just doesn'thave the cultural relevance as it didwhen Vince Carter was dunking oneveryone to try and figure out why theNike Shox failed I took to our Facebookgroup of diehard sneaker enthusiastshere's what some of them had to say theywere the worst not comfortable noresponse and it looked like garbage inmy opinion they're only retro as a cashgrab nostalgia sell sneakers the pair Iowned it felt like the aestheticsexceeded the functionality of it andwith that said people wouldn'tnecessarily wear shocks to the clubeither kind of just felt like a visualgimmick attached 200k shoes here's onemorethey were Mis marketed the shockstechnology originally debuted as newtech for running shoethe problem is that most runnersespecially ones willing to invest in anew sneaker technology aren't heelstrikers they run on the balls of theirfeet so the springs really made theshoes heavy while providing littlesupport near the ball of the foot nikelater brought shocks into basketballwork performs much better but thereviews had already set the technologytoo far back to be saved okay so maybeit wasn't exactly a commercial failurebecause obviously there's some demand inthe market because Nike keeps on Retroin shops but the overall consensus isthat the shoes weren't that comfortableto begin with they didn't really deliveron the promise of performance orcushioningmaybe it's because when we all saw beenscarred or dunk on that seven-footFrench dude we thought that we'd bejumping that high too but what do youguys think do you guys have any memoriesof wearing Nike Shox do you rememberwhen they first came out also I'velinked this video for you it's a videoof Jordan Geller showing off his NikeShox collection if you don't know whoJordan Geller is he's the founder ofshoes iam and he's a legend in theindustry at one point he held theGuinness world record for largestpersonal collection of sneakers so yeahgo ahead and check that out I thinkyou're really going to enjoy it andcatch you guys next timethank you guys so much for

born one of thesilhouettes most striking features wasthe shank which extends from the bottomsole to the midsole this was actuallyinspired by the tell of a well here's aquote from McDowell himself the shank isa modified well tell that tail comingout of the water is so iconicMcDowell's lack of experience that Nikewas actually one of the main keys tounlocking the shoes originality take -swoosh for instance it's easily one ofthe most instantly recognizable logos inthe history of design let alone fashionyet because it was an experienceaccording to him he simply winged it noone had given me any guidance because itwas my first few days the shape is alittle bit off and I put the border onthe inside when technically all thebrand guidelines say to go outsidebecause McDowell was so green heconstantly broke sneaker designconventions sometimes without evenknowing it for example he took his ownobservations as a runner to implementreflectivity and footwear design in avery new way I grew up a runner and youlearn to always run facing traffic sothat carts can see and I thought it'sweird that they put reflectivity on theback of every shoe when you needreflectivity all the way up the front soI put bars of reflectivity going all theway up the forefoot the vamp and thetongue the tee and air logo which standsfor tuned air is one of the most famousicons in Nikes history everyone knowsthat the Air Max Plus is a shoe that issynonymous with the TN logo but thehexagonal branding was a surprise at thetime for the M designer McDowell didn'twant todesign initially they told me the TN airlogo was a big deal and I needed tofeature it prominently the initialdesign sketches I got approved byfootlocker's didn't include the TN logoas a publication we galloped through theTN logo on the back and the soul of theshoot tuned air was a huge technologicalshift for Nike the tuned air unitfeatured with Nike called hemispheressolid half spheres inserted into thesole and air use which allowed them toreduce pressure in the heel whileincreasing cushioning in the forefootnike considered tuned air to be the mostsignificant innovation in the history ofair technology it wouldn't be updateduntil 2006 with the release of the airmax 360 think about that for a secondfor a brand that's made its reputationenough innovation tuned to air has stoodout as the best technology invisible airNikes choice technology for almost adecade everything was going according toplaneveryone loves the design and theaccompanying innovative features butthere was one little problem the fadedupper Sean McDowell's picturesque sunsetfade that he had envisioned was nowbeing dubbed impossible to create byNike being naive in news McDowell wouldnot take no for an answerI drew the fade and everyone was likeyou'll never be able to do thatyou can't find material like that beingin experience he was determined andwilling to do everything he can to provethem wrong and he was right it waspossible Nike have been using smoothgradient type designs on their apparelfor years McDowell knew that it could bepulled off and it literally just tookone sample to get the desired effect itwas perfectfootlocker and thank you were so dazzledby the shoe that they decided to bypasstheir traditional route of doingmarketing research and focus groupsinstead they decided to simply place thesample pair on the shelves of a localfootlocker to seekids would react Shawn McDowellexplained what happened next five or tenminutes later there were like ten kidsflocking as the shoe asked him what isthis how do I get it the associates werelooking around like I've never seen thatthing before I don't know how much itcosts I don't know where it came fromall the kids were running around like Iwant to buy this thing they were almostfrantic I was beaming one of the majorhurdles for the Air Max Plus was havingto compete with the actual Air Max lineyou see this shoe wasn't exactly slatedto be the next heir of the Year modelNike was placing its bets on the NikeAir Max 98 but nonetheless in 1988 Nikereleased the original trio of Air MaxPlus colorways too much successMcDowell's original Florida inspiredsketches were used to tell a three-partstory there was the sunset colorway withthe blue and yellow fade the night skymodel he cooked with black and hints ofred and the sunrise was blinding orangehues and shades of yellowdespite releasing alongside the Air Max98 the Nike Air Max Plus TN thrived aninteresting part of the Air Max buseshistory was its international appeal theAir Max Plus gained a cult following inEurope and Australia in those marketsthe shoes better known by two letters TNthe hexagonal logo which McDowell wasincident to include came to define theshoe the TN really became popular ininner city streets or it became afavorite among street kids who hadenough money to afford a pair thanks tothe silhouettes crazy and intimidatingdesign the TN symbolized the bad-boyimage in the UK Australia and Francehere in the US the Air Max Plus is knownfor its heavy cult-like followingamongst tinker aficionados trust me ifyou know an Air Max Plus spam boy orfangirl then you know how crazy they canbe about their collection later on downthe years Nike attempted to follow upthe iconic silhouette with the Air Maxplus two three and five but the shoesdidn't have the cultural andtechnological impact the original AirMax Plus did their Max Plus releasedover 20 years ago and continues to beone of the top silhouettes out therereflecting on the shoe now the Air MaxPlus wasn't destined to become thefootwear icon we know today how could itbe it was assigned to an experiencedNike designer who couldn't even draw thebrand's logo properly but that's exactlywhat made the silhouette so specialShaun

hated itis this new air unit purely a gimmickplaying off shock value to pique theinterest of the sneaker industry's mostgullible consumerswell today nike air technology is apillar of the sneaker industrycoveted imitated and respected worldwidebut in 1987 some people even within nikehated it the designer who conceived thisfuturistic new conceptput his entire career on the line whenpitching the visible air unitsit was widely discussed that i hadpushed it too far people were trying toget us firedfast forward 30 years into the futureand it's 2017.could any of the original nike hatershave guessed we'd be wearingthese much like the conversationsurrounding nike air technology in 1987nike air vapor max is an extremelydivisive topicthis is one corner of sneaker designthat you really either love or hateregardless of how you feel about itthough what is the true identity ofvapormaxis it the pinnacle of the nike airunit's evolutionthe ultimate performance running shootas nike's marketing would have youbelieveor is it merely one visual element ofsneaker designpushed to its limits for the sake of abold fashion statementhello everybody and welcome back to thechannel if you're new here my

wemake videos like thisall the time and you're not going towant to miss an upload all right guyswith that out of the waylet's get into the video about the nikevapor max vapormaxis one of the youngest lines of sneakersthat we've ever covered in our videosthe first vapormax dropped only threeyears ago in march of 2017 for 190despite the shocking aesthetic of itssoul the first version was actuallypretty minimalone of the main goals of the vapormaxdesign was to do away withunnecessary aspects of the shoe cuttingdown on the weightand bringing the wear closer to the airtechnology the processof designing and testing the vapormaxsole was painstakinglegend has it that it took 15 tries toget the soul right and that the shoe hadto be tested on 350 different runnersnike also claims that the mold for thesole is composed of over 39000 different components the exhaustivetesting and reworking of the vapormaxsoleresulted in its designers completelyeliminating the need for a couple ofelements that are typically essential tothe anatomy of most sneakersprevious air max running shoes such asthe air max 95and air max 97 had always incorporated athick layer of foam which comprised themidsole among other elements such asglue and rubberflyknit vapor maxes however arecomprised only of the flyknit uppermolded to a single mass of tpusince nike chose to market vapormax asthe future of running sneaker technologyi'm curious to hear from runners as tohow the vapormax performs as a runningshoei've never tried on a pair of flyknitvapormaxes myselfbut i do own a pair of vapormax 360s andi cannot imaginechoosing to run in them over any otherrunning shoe the vapormax 360s are acomfortable enough sneaker but even justwalking in them feels sort of unstablehave you guys ever tried on a pair ofvapor maxes what was that experiencelike did you actually go running in themi've heard from a lot of people thatthey actually roll their ankle leave acomment down belowit's hard to give a generalizedbreakdown about the anatomy of avapormax shoe becausemany of the vapormax releases we've seensince its first drop have been hybriddesignsattaching vapormax soles to the uppersof og silhouettes there's the vapormax97 95the vapormax 360 and the vapormax pluseven though the vapormax line is onlylike three years oldthere's already too many models to coverin one single video like they reallywent all out with the vapormax linethere's the laceless vapormax mockshort for moccasin and the vapormax mach2 the vapormax 2019 and 2019 utilitythe vapormax glycee which while notreally a hybridis based on the nike air dt max or howabout the vapormaxfk 2020 which features a two-part lacelocking systemwhich you pull from the back to lock andrelease at the front at the top of thetonguethe shoe was marketed not only as beingmade of at least 50recycled materials but also marking thenext steps towards nike's ultimate goalof zero carbonzero waste i wonder if they're going tocommit to that adding to the list ofnike's many collabs with off-whitethere's a nike air vapormax off-white2018another high fashion collab we've gotthe laceless nike air vapormax coms togarconone of my personal favorites is thecactus plant flea market and women's airvapormax 2019 collaba unisex women's size priority vapormaxthat sports an avant-gardeasymmetrical design with so many detailsand hidden featuresto get the standard version in my sizeright now i'd have to drop aroundfourteen hundred dollarsa couple of months ago jordan brandactually implemented the vapormax soulinto a shoe with thejordan rain these are horrible if you'veever seenthey look like a team jordan or maybelike a some kind of jordan fusion andi don't know if you thought the airjordan rain was the most wildapplication of the vapormax technologythink again check out the women's nikeair vapormax light 2.released in 2018 with the price tag of180i don't think this hybrid boot was muchof a hit because i could hardly evenfind any information about them onlinenot a single youtube review how do youguys rate the acronym and nike airvapormax mockretailing for 225 dollars it came inthree different colorways and was firstteased to consumers was an old westernstyle short filmstarring acronym founder earlson hughand singer-songwriter john mayerwho himself is known to be both thesneaker head and a fan of acronymif you guys want the full story of theacronym vapormax check out this videothat our homie dr soules made all aboutthe collabi'll put a link to his video in thedescription sowe know that despite the initialpushback on the idea of the visible airunit and air max 1the shoe was a monumental success andthough we might be able to drawparallels between the air max 1 and thevapormaxnot every sneaker that includes boldrisky new technologyis successful in its leap of faith ifyou watched our video on the history ofnike shocksyou know that shocks was one of thosenike releases that took that leap offaithand ended up failing short of nike'sother endeavorsthe hype was relatively short-lived andshocks just never found the acceptanceand long-term mainstream success thatthe jordan or air max lines enjoyed andgrew fromis vapormax doomed to a similar fate asnike shocksseems to me that if vapormax cushioningtech doesn't end up being the future ofrunning shoe designvapormax is likely going to have tosurvive off the strength of itsaesthetic appeal alonewhich honestly at this point i could seeworking out vapormax has already seenso many hybrids and collabs in the merethree years since its launch thatit or hate it i think we've only seenthe beginning of vapormaxwhat are your guys's thoughts on thelongevity of vapormax and do you thinkit's really going to stand the test oftime or notbut

Unboxing and first impressions - Latest Nike Golf Shoes,ZhMl55BRKe0,12800
hi guys come in here from golf growreviews and in today's video we're gonnado what is a first for my channelbecause we're gonna do a reaction videoand an unboxing video so these nightgolf shoes have just arrived in the posthead the studio set up so I thought whynot film a quick reaction video so thisis not a full review video this is justmy initial thoughts of these golf shoesand they are the hotly anticipated andbrand new night react infinity pro nowwe are all awaiting the release of theInfinity talked of shoes and these seemto be a quietly released takedown modelfrom night golf I didn't see muchfanfare about them certainly didn't seeany press releases and when you look atthe specs of these shoes there'scertainly a takedown model compared tothe Infinity tall but they're currentlyretailing now on in the UK for a hundredpounds so I thought I'd order them andtake a look check them out see ifthey're worth 100 pounds because I'vegot a feeling the infinite or are gonnabe a lot more than that so let's openthese up here we go and we've got thewhite and black versions let's takethese ones out the white and blackversions of the reactor pro so let mestick the box down thereso first impressions right out of theboxare quite like the colorway it's niceand simplistic on initial look you'vegot this black and white colourway herebut actually if I take a closer look atit yeah you've got some detail in hereon the black area on the hill so notonly if you've got this polka dotpattern on the night squash but if Ihold it up to the camera there can yousee that you've got this kind of likevery dock camo pattern it's notreflective but as I move it in the lightthere you can just kind of see thedifference homes of that camo to thenaked eyes you look quite far away fromityeah you probably can't necessarily seethat it's gonna look black for themajority of the people looking him onthe golf course but as you get closeryou can definitely see that little bitof reflection on the show which is quitecool a second thing I'd say about theshowis that this is the night skin I believesynthetic material if I remember up fromthe materials I did see my store on thewebsite and it's quite interesting sogiven that the tour is going to use theFlyknit technology which I'm reallyreally looking forward to this is usingthe night skin but they've made it looklike flying it so they've kind ofembossed a pattern definitely on the toebox area you can see that embossedpattern so that's quite interestingquite cheeky then of what feels like Ihaven't tried them on yet but yeahthat's interesting and then on the sideit's less so I suppose the fly knitpattern you've just got more just kindof this embossing reminds me of thereactive a photos which I've done a fullreview of I did a comparison compared tothe Roche G tours so I'll leave the linkabove this you can go check that outbut yeah it feels very very similarnight skin is a material they use on alot of their football boots so you knowit's a nice lightweight materialpersonally I'm not entirely convincedabout the breathability of the materialwhen I've used my ReactOS my feet do geta little bit hot and stuffy but it'snice and lightweight and nice anddurable this feels a little bit stiffactually interesting so it might take alittle bit of time for these to break inI'll let you know in the form of you butyou know ultimately these are a takedownmodel so you know if you don't want tospend the money on the the tall versionthe infinity tours which use the Flyknitthese are going to be an option but Ithink interestingly it really dependsupon how much the infinite or is goingto be because you know if they're notthat much more I've got a feeling Imight prefer and go forward the Flyknitversions so it'll be interesting to seewhen they finally get released in termsof detailing and styling you've got thisbig polka dot swoosh there on the sideand that's on the inside as well as Imentioned you've got this camo kind ofreflective material their color patterngoing on you've got just a pretty plainstandard Knight swoosh on the top andthen you've got the knight logo runningdown the hill of the shoe no Hill pooland this shoe and actually looking at itthat Hill area does seem to come upquite high so that will be interestingto see how that feels in regards towhether that's gonna get in the way ofmy ankles at all but yeah in regards todesign styling I think it's quiteminimalist let me know down in thecomments what do you think on themidsole you've got the full length reactfoam which you can see here you've gotthe relay ball and the react foam isvery very comfortable I've used thatbefore on the react paper twosreally really soft underfoot and it'sdefinitely giving boost of run for itsmoney personally I don't think it'squite as soft but still very very softvery very comfortable now what I'minterested in is actually the undersideof the shoe so you can see here on thesoleplate that actually what they'veused is like a plastic kind of coatingwhich covers the react foam so I'minterested to see how hard wearing thatis because if you take a look here I'vegot the epic react flying it trainersreally really love these really reallylightweight just a great great trainerbut they use and the react foam and it'sexposed on the bottom and you can seehere that it wore away really reallyquick I've only had these about sixmonthsdon't even go running in these I justuse them for walking to and from workand just casually and while they arevery soft and very comfortable that isdefinitely wearing away very veryquickly so I'm interested to see how itworks with these because they've putthat coating on let's see out on thecourse how that actually stands up isthat gonna wear away that coating or isthat going to be resistant enough I'mnot sure this is just the first video sowe will see one of our area I wanted tohighlight in this very quick video isactually the spikes on these so you cansee here you've got these two largerspikes at the front and then this onemassive one at the rear and I believeMike they're calling these piston spikesnow looking at them because I wascurious they're not removable they areattached and part of the sole of theshow so what you've got it's probablyeasy to demonstrate here on the big oneis that there's a lot of flicks in thesespikes essentially if I move it sidewayscan you see that there there's a lot offlicks going on with these spikes veryvery soft and so they're just going tokind of sit down and compress when youare wearing them out on the course nowagain I've not really tested any golfshoes that kind of have that designthe bottom so I can't say how that'sgoing to hold up definitely gonna bereally really interesting to see thekind of traction that provides also youknow how durable these spikes that's aquestion I want to ask to give them thatthey're non replaceable if you snap oneoff you know you're gonna compromise theamount of grip you'll get in from theseshoes does that bother you that youcan't replace the spikes in these showsbecause they've kind of gone for thisweird hybrid you know it's not aspiteful show because they are very muchspikes but they're not replaceable so Iwon't call it a spike show let me knowwhat you think down in the commentswould that put you off are you happywith that we've really interesting tosee how they perform long course sothere we go that was just a very veryquick first look video of the brand newnight creates infinity pro golf shows Ilook forward to testing these out and Idefinitely look forward to testing outhow they stack up against the infinitytour when they're finally released herein the UK we really hope you enjoyedthis video so make sure you give it alike

hi Jacoba unisport webtv and on today's menu wehave our review of the Nike magistaOprah now the magista has build up quitesome busts so today we're going to takea look at if this boot can actuallyrevolutionize the way we think aboutfootball boots so if you want to knowhow the magista Oprah performs on thepitch then you better stay right herewith me so let's look at the fit side ofthe boot because herenow you wanted to eliminate all thedistractions on the magista and sointroduced the Flyknit upper and thedynamic fit collar now because of thisnew construction some of you might beworried that the magista is tough to puton but luckily it's not as hard as itseems because basically you just gottaloosen the laces up a bit and then pullthe boot on like a regular socket andokay you got to pull a bit harder butyou get the deal and once you get theboot on you really feel that the fit issomething else now because of this reeflining material and the dynamic fitcolor you get a pretty close tight areally personal fit in the magista andit's basically like it's made to followthe shape of your foot and also nikehave applied a black inner lining whichis slightly padded so you get a verycomfortable feeling wrapping around yourfoot while also making the magista feela little bit more solid that you wouldactually think I need to boot X now theawesome thing about flying it is that itallows Nike to actually remove thetongue on the Medusa which makes theboot really hawk your foot uber tightall over basically wrapping it like asock wood and further enhancing thisfeeling are the Brio cables that go fromthe soleplate into the eye state andwhen you're pulling the laces tight youcan really feel that the beat iswrapping your foot like a sock andproviding lockdown and the cool thingwith the fact that there is laseron the magista they didn't need to bebecause the upper would still fit youwell but because of the laces you canreally pull the boot tight and adjustyourself how tight you want it to be noweven though the Brio cables work reallywell in keeping your foot on the plate Iwas looking for just a tiny bit morelockdownin the magista simply because my foottended to move just a little bit whenchanging directions with a lot of forceand I mean it's no big deal but it'sjust something I know it size wise I'dsay the magista is true to size I wasn'twith my usual size 40 and the fit ispretty much perfect both length andwidth wise but the coolest thing aboutthe magista is that the gr13 lasts thebooties bill on will accommodate both aslim and a wide foot especially becausethe fly net material will stretch to fitthe white footed playersnow the thing that really sets themagista apart from any other boot I'veever tried is the dynamic fit color andbasically it makes the magista feel morelike a part of your foot than any otherfootball boot out there but to be honestI don't think that physically it makesyour lower leg and your foot move morein unison than in say any other footpoking the thing is it feels like thatand you get that sensation mainlybecause of the closed seamless fit likethere basically are no distractionsbetween these parts of your leg and yourfoot because the magista is made to helpyou move in tight spacesit's equipped with a pee bags an islandsoleplate with mostly conical studs andalso a few bladed studs now you canactually feel that the nylon frame ispretty stiff and responsive making themagista feel like it's reacting verywell to your little bursts of speed andcombining that with the fact that nikeremoves the insole board you're reallyclose to the ground and can transferenergy from your foot to the soleplateand then ultimately the ground themagista also made me feel a bit morefree in my movements and after thinkingabout it I came to the conclusion thatit's because 19the soleplate without the mechanicalflex which basically means that my footis not forced to bend in the same areain the same way every time and when youcombine this with the stiffness and thestability from the nylon frame youactually get a very nice combinationwhere you feel you can basically burstinto any direction you want at any timegrip wise the magista just what it'ssupposed to which is help you turn ontight spaces mainly thanks to theconical studs that really give you aseamless motion through the ground whenyou're turning on the spot and I reallylike it in that aspect now as we knowmagista is made for the creativemidfielder and as a midfielder you needas much control on the ball as you canpossibly get and to do this Nike haveequip the Flyknit upper with these realcables that create this honeycomb blackpattern and that is one to give you morestability but also two to give you morefriction on the ball and we know thatmore friction needs more grip and moregrip means a bit more control but thequestion is how does it workand yeah it actually works pretty welland the touching the magista is quite aninteresting combination mostly becauseon one hand you get a pretty close tothe ball feel thanks to the thin Flyknitupper rim but then again on the otherhand it's also a bit soft and slightlypadded mostly thanks to this slightlycushioned inner lining so it's a bit ofa mix that's very very interesting nowit's not a total barefoot like feel buthaving said that you're still a lotcloser to the ball in the magista thanin other boots with similar amounts ofgripwhen it comes to shooting the magista ispretty no-nonsense there are no issuesgetting under the ball and because youhave no tongue you really get a niceclean striking surface all over theOpera but one of the best things whenstriking the ball to me is the innerlining because again it takes away a bitof this thing when you really strike theball hard and it makes it a ripepleasure because the padding is just theright combination or you can still feela lot but it doesn't hurt that muchwhen you really put your foot throughthe ball when it comes to the Briocables they're also going to give you abit of friction when you're striking theball whether you're striking it with theinside of your foot for the instep anddon't get me wrong it's not going toturn you into this world master butthere's still a nice little toolso the final verdict on the magistaobrah is that it's well it's reallyreally awesome and the fit is one of thebest I have ever tried in a footballboom similar because it fits your footso closely that is actually hard todescribe you have to try it and to putit into perspective when I went back toa conventional football team I reallymissed the closest ation off the planetand the dynamic bit color it's that goodwell what do you think about the magistaOprah and is it something for you wellleave your thoughts in the commentsection below and if you have questionswell that's the way to go swell becausethis was all I have to do for today I'llsee you later on and use the wet TVsigning off to yell so is it hard toclean the magista well for the part thathas Nike skin with a CC on it water anddirt will come right off when you wipeit with a cloth but the dynamic colorand the tongue pod is exposed the finiteis

hi Jacoba unisport webtv and on today's menu wehave our review of the Nike magistaOprah now the magista has build up quitesome busts so today we're going to takea look at if this boot can actuallyrevolutionize the way we think aboutfootball boots so if you want to knowhow the magista Oprah performs on thepitch then you better stay right herewith me so let's look at the fit side ofthe boot because herenow you wanted to eliminate all thedistractions on the magista and sointroduced the Flyknit upper and thedynamic fit collar now because of thisnew construction some of you might beworried that the magista is tough to puton but luckily it's not as hard as itseems because basically you just gottaloosen the laces up a bit and then pullthe boot on like a regular socket andokay you got to pull a bit harder butyou get the deal and once you get theboot on you really feel that the fit issomething else now because of this reeflining material and the dynamic fitcolor you get a pretty close tight areally personal fit in the magista andit's basically like it's made to followthe shape of your foot and also nikehave applied a black inner lining whichis slightly padded so you get a verycomfortable feeling wrapping around yourfoot while also making the magista feela little bit more solid that you wouldactually think I need to boot X now theawesome thing about flying it is that itallows Nike to actually remove thetongue on the Medusa which makes theboot really hawk your foot uber tightall over basically wrapping it like asock wood and further enhancing thisfeeling are the Brio cables that go fromthe soleplate into the eye state andwhen you're pulling the laces tight youcan really feel that the beat iswrapping your foot like a sock andproviding lockdown and the cool thingwith the fact that there is laseron the magista they didn't need to bebecause the upper would still fit youwell but because of the laces you canreally pull the boot tight and adjustyourself how tight you want it to be noweven though the Brio cables work reallywell in keeping your foot on the plate Iwas looking for just a tiny bit morelockdownin the magista simply because my foottended to move just a little bit whenchanging directions with a lot of forceand I mean it's no big deal but it'sjust something I know it size wise I'dsay the magista is true to size I wasn'twith my usual size 40 and the fit ispretty much perfect both length andwidth wise but the coolest thing aboutthe magista is that the gr13 lasts thebooties bill on will accommodate both aslim and a wide foot especially becausethe fly net material will stretch to fitthe white footed playersnow the thing that really sets themagista apart from any other boot I'veever tried is the dynamic fit color andbasically it makes the magista feel morelike a part of your foot than any otherfootball boot out there but to be honestI don't think that physically it makesyour lower leg and your foot move morein unison than in say any other footpoking the thing is it feels like thatand you get that sensation mainlybecause of the closed seamless fit likethere basically are no distractionsbetween these parts of your leg and yourfoot because the magista is made to helpyou move in tight spacesit's equipped with a pee bags an islandsoleplate with mostly conical studs andalso a few bladed studs now you canactually feel that the nylon frame ispretty stiff and responsive making themagista feel like it's reacting verywell to your little bursts of speed andcombining that with the fact that nikeremoves the insole board you're reallyclose to the ground and can transferenergy from your foot to the soleplateand then ultimately the ground themagista also made me feel a bit morefree in my movements and after thinkingabout it I came to the conclusion thatit's because 19the soleplate without the mechanicalflex which basically means that my footis not forced to bend in the same areain the same way every time and when youcombine this with the stiffness and thestability from the nylon frame youactually get a very nice combinationwhere you feel you can basically burstinto any direction you want at any timegrip wise

hi everyone kevin here from golf guyreviews and in today's video i'm goingto give you a preview of the brand newnike air max 270 g golf shoes now theseare launched here in the UK for ahundred and thirty pounds on the nikewebsite and they have literally justdropped a couple of days ago over in thestates about a hundred and fifty dollarsnow this is just gonna be a previewvideo today I've not worn these out onthe course so keep a look out for myupcoming review of these because Idefinitely won't be giving you a fullreview but for now this is just verymuch a first look video I wanted to showeveryone a few of the details up closeyou can kind of see them and a littlebit more detail rather than just thesestock images on the nike website andalso only to let you know how theyactually fit on feet in case you'rethinking about buying a pair of these asI say this isn't my full review thatwill be coming soon but for now let'stake a closer look at these so theseshoes just launched last week andinitially it was just this colorway soyou've got this kind of 10 cookie colorI suppose upper with this maroon e pinkair bubble at the back and so I pickedthese up straight away on the day thatthey launched and then the very next daythey launched two more colorways andthen another colorway as well so at themoment there's 4 colorways launched herein the UK but I have seen plenty ofother different color options as wellbeing teased from some of the pictureson Instagram as well so I'm pretty surethere's gonna be plenty more colorwayscoming out in this show now nike saythis is a stitch 4 stitch replica of theoriginal air max 270 trainers and you'vegot to say that it really does have thaticonic silhouette it's kind of matchedit really well in regards to the upperand you've got this massive air bubbleat the rear which i think at the timewhen the china was launched it was thebiggest air bubble nike had ever done soyeah this really looks similar to theoriginal trainer that was to be fairit's not even that old of a traineractually it's only a few years old Ithinkbut yeah they've done a really good jobin regards to the actual silhouette andthen they've changed that upper a littlebit in regards to the materials to giveit a bit more stiffness a bit help withthe stability and then they've put adedicated sole on the bottom as wellwhich is going to give you more tractionout on the golf course compared to anormal pair of trainers in regards tothe style and the look then that'stotally going to come down to personalpreference personally I was never thebiggest fan of the MX 270 I've just feltit looked a bit toohad to say a bit too young for me to behonest I'm not exactly a young guy I'mgetting old about a day and I justpersonally prefer the look of the airmax 90 that's my favorite MX or evenjust an AMX one that's my kind ofpreference for the silhouette and sothis is very much even going to be alove it or hate kind of shoe and if youlove the 270 then I think yous gonnaabsolutely love this let me know down inthe comments what you think of this shoewould you wear this out on the courseis this your type of trainer or wouldyou like to see something a little bitmore traditional now I think what'squite interesting with the launch ofthis shoe as well is that actuallyoriginally the MX 270 was designed as alifestyle sneaker from Nike it very muchwasn't designed for performance so nowit's been turned into a golf performanceshow now interestingly with the othertrainers that Nike you've turned intogolf shoes you think you had the MX 97the MX 1 jeez you've got the rush azor apair of trainers which are now golfshoes you've even got the infinity tourand the Infiniti pro they wereoriginally running shows all of thoseshoes were originally designed forsporting performance not necessarilygolf but still some kind of sport orrunning or a flakes or anything likethat this is the first pair that I canthink of really that they've turned apair of lifestyle trainers into adedicated pair of golf shoes so againit's just a really interesting directionfrom Nike at the moment you just seem torefuse to want to make actual dedicatedgolf shoes and just rather use theexisting designs that they already knowpeople know and love so let's take aquick look at the upper in closer detailand first of all you can see here thatthe majority of the upper here is thismesh material I say it's a mesh materialbecause the original MX 270 is used thismesh material and you can just kind ofsee underneath there you've got thiskind of criss cross pattern on the meshthere but it's got an overlay on it andthat's there to help with the raw proofmiss of the show and to give it a littlebit more stability as well it kind ofgives it a bit of almost like a rubberytexture not quite full rubbery texture Isuppose if you're going to describe itbut definitely a bit more of a textureit doesn't necessarily feel like anormal mesh you've got these hot fusedelements as well so you've got a pieceright along the toe box there whichzoom is there to help kind of with theprotection on the golf swing and you cansee as well the fact that on the insideof the show the rubber outsole comes upa little bit as well to give it a littlebit more protection there so you're notdamaging the phone too much on theinside of the show you've got the Nikeswoosh there on the outside and you'vegot a few other style elements too so onthe tongue there you can see that you'vegot a golf 270 logo with the two sorrywould be F and the two kind of mergedinto each other and then again on therear of the show similar to the originalyou've got a air logo on the back thereand it's kind of got this kind of paddedeffect to it and looks quite nice fromthe rear but from the rear you can justsee that this show is absolutelydominated by that ginormous air bubbleand from the side as well there you canreally see it kind of almost protrudeprotrudes at the back a little bit thereand what's really cool with this designfeature of the shoe Inc and it's exactlythe same on the original show is thatthey've made it so that the externalheel counter actually kind of looks likeit merges in with the air bubble as wellthat's not actually one piece they aretwo separate pieces there but you knowit's quite interesting and good for agolf shoe really because that's quite achunky heel counter there so hopefullygonna get a decent amount of stabilityand lock down in the hill I hope youenjoyed this preview so far and findingit helpful so hit that like button ifyou are and if you haven't done soalready please make sure you subscribeto my channel so you can keep up to datewith all my latest reviews of golf shoesclothing and tech right here on golf guyreviews a couple of other very smalldesign points as well you can see on thepull tab at the rear there you've gotgolf 270 on the pull tab and on theinside too you've got a little 270 logoand a Nike swoosh on the side theresorry I know I said Nike its Nike Icompletely appreciate that the companyis called Nike but here in the UK I'dguarantee you that everybody says Mikeso I'm just trying to you know say Nikea little bit more it's really hard whenfor the last 30 odd years you've said noik I'm doing my besta couple of things to point out on theupper first of all you can see that thelaces are kind of offset from this shoeand that's just kind of a little bit ofa unique style of the show I supposewhat is more interesting I think aboutthe laces in the upper is the fact thatit is a one-piece construction so thereisn't really a tongue to speak of it'sjust a singlebutI now that's kind of interesting it'swhat the original did so to be fairthey're only copying what the originalMX 270 did but it does mean for me thatyou can't really adjust the fit of theshoe with the lacesit's no good really kind of pulling thelaces tighter across the shoe becauseall you do is just crease this front bitreally you're not pulling the wholeupper across your foot so muchso again interested to see how thataffects performance out on the golfcourse personally one I'm not thebiggest fan of this silhouette Iactually quite liked this colorway Iwasn't sure about it initially when Ifirst got it because I wouldn'tnaturally pick up a pair of trainers inthis colorway but I quite like the factthat this rear air bubble really standsout really sets it apart they'redefinitely gonna stand out on the golfcourse and quite like this cookie coloractually I don't think that's theofficial name I'm just calling it thecookie color and the combination withthe black I quite like it I'm kind of ofthe opinion that if you are gonna get apair of golf shoes that are gonna standout on the course make them really standout kind of similar you know to the Pumaice geez they're they really stand outthat's why I got that colorway in thembecause they really stand out so again Iapplaud Nike for releasing these andactually the more I'm with them the morequite like I'm actually in regards tothe color and the look so flipping themover to have a look at the sole and youcan see here that you've got quite anaggressive soleplate on the bottom thereit's this rubber material and it's veryvery similar to the material that youget on the MX 1 G's or the 97g but theyhave updated it specifically for theseshoes and you can see here that you'vegot this kind of pink material in themiddle which is a slightly differentkind of texture so again it'll be reallyinteresting to see actually how theseperform out on the course and the amountof grip that you can get from them nowwhen I first put these shoes on I wasactually quite surprised with the fitmuch like I believe the original Air Max270 trainers these do fit quite close tothe foot there's not a huge amount ofroom there even though they actuallylooked like quite big chunky trainers tome personally they felt that theyactually fit quite slim and I just abouthad enough room at the end of the toebox set for my toes I'm a UK 9 and Iwent true to size in the end I did buy apairof larger ones as well I went up to anine and a half and although theydefinitely had more room in the toe boxarea and across the width of my foot myheel was actually slipping a bit in thenine and a half's whereas in the ninethey were a better lock down fit in thehill area so I stuck with the nines ifyou have got a wider foot then it's kindof a similar trend at the moment with alot of golf shoes maybe these won't bethe shoes for you because they do feelquite kind of tight and restrictiveacross the width of my foot there sosomething for you to considerI've not seen that ever released a widefoot version I don't think they've everdone that with their other MX golf shoesso I don't suspect that that's going tobe the case with these either but what Idid quite liked is the way that thiskind of one-piece upper fit I was alittle bit concerned initially inregards to not having a tongue and notbeing able to adjust it but at the Boxjust wearing them around the house Ifound them to be quite comfortable andit actually feels quite nicely kind ofwrapped around my foot initially butagain the truth will be once we get themout on the golf course also with theshoes on I wanted to talk about how theyfeel under feet and first of all I'vegot to say that I was really reallyimpressed with the giant air bubble atthe back of the 270 as you can kind ofexpect it's quite nice and soft andsquishy there's a lot of kind of bounceto it and you can really feel it underthe here and the show what was actuallyreally impressed with as well was themidsole of the shoe as you can see hereyou've got the wet foam going from kindof the middle in the show or at the wayit to the front and in other airmax golfshoes I found that to be a little bitfirm actually in the Gulf versions ofthe MX one and the 97 GSI found the golf versions to be firmerthan the regular trainer versions withthese I actually found that foam to beactually really quite soft now nikehaven't said specifically that it'sanything in particular you know it'scertainly not made any claims that thisis react foam and i think they'll beshouting from the rooftops of it wasbecause you can get mx2 70s with reactfoam and but that just wasn't whatinitially launched with I think this isjust a regular foam that nike use but itis very very soft underfoot and I wasreally impressed with that actually sooverall these give a really decent levelof comfort underfoot and even thoughyou've got quite harshrubbertraction on the sole I was actuallyreally quite impressed you can feel abit of the transition from the airbubble at the hill to the foam at thefront but I'm gonna reserve judgment asto how much that impacts me and how muchyou really feel it until I've managed toget several rounds out on the golfcourse with these shows so make sure youtune in and make sure you keep an eyeout for my latest videos because I willbe posting a full review of these shoesand once I've managed to get out on thecourse if you want to know more aboutAir Max golf shoes then I have reviewedboth the MX 1g of the original versionsand the 20/20 versions as well as the MX+ 97 G's and so I'll include links inthe description below so you can gocheck out those reviews but I've got tosay out the box just wearing theminitially around the house I think thesedo feel like the most comfortable AirMax golf shoes that I've tried so farbut again I will let you know once I'vedone my fall review I really hope youenjoyed this preview today and hit

[Music]today we're gonna review the NikeMercurial Superfly 6 to see if it's anybetter then the Superfly 5 and to reallytest the new boot abroad jobs who asksimpressively wide foot to really pushthe Superflyto its absolute limits exactly butunfortunately J might we can make anepic review here so why don't we bothlay down and dream of someplace verynice cool[Applause]I chose to dream myself away to Monacoto look at what is essentially the vapor12 with a dynamic fit collar it featuresthe same 360 degree one-piece file itupper and I solve that split into aninner chasse and two outs old pots thatmeans that in general the fit is a lotlike on the vapor 12 it's tight andfollows your fit very closely but in aless restrictive and more rounded waythan on the Superfly 5 then there's adynamic fit collar that gives you a verycompressed sensation around the anklethat almost tricks your brain intothinking it is more like of a naturalextension of your foot and it's a lotless chunky and more nice I think thatunder Superfly 5 and with a slightlylong and low toe box the Superfly 6feels like a knitted aerodynamic speechinstant for your foot that really filledme with[Music][Applause]what I really like though is our thefree upper works extremely well with theanatomical soul play that almost sucksyour foot in to give you an extremelylock-in fit and combining that with avery aggressive feeling because of thetraction you get a pretty potentsensation under your foot in that regardit's my job to watch enough that you'redoing here it's a man it's more like asun is shining I want to join okay it'smy dream inceptionhe also came to Monaco to enjoy thesuperfly cigs in a beautiful settingbecause with the new gradual likeencoding the booth made promises ofbeing able to stretch enough to feed mywife and it did it is of course verytight and close to the food takes alittle bit more braking time compared tothe flight in ultra but you do noticehow there's more space here on top ofthe boots for us white hooded peoplewhere the fly need is more exposed andthat makes a huge differenceagain it's tied it snug it's close toyour food but it's not uncomfortable andif you go to the sides have a little bitof patience for the breaking period youcan fit the Superfly no matter the shapeof your foot[Music]the touch is also interesting as you getsuch a thin upper package it means tofeel a lot closer to the ball and get agood amount of grip so it doesn't feellike the ball is slipping away andbecause there's no foam on the uppershooting feels close and bear food likeno matter where on the food you hit it[Music]sadly dreams don't last and back in graycold Denmark we decided to give theSuperfly a reality check and look atwhat it could do better now the firstthing I noticed is that just like on thevapor 12 the upper is a little bit toostiff for my liking when you take it outof the box it's softer than on the vaporjust a little bit but still a bit for meI would actually agree and I was also alittle bit disappointed in the breakingtime this board requires especiallycoming from the fly at Ultra we saw lastyear which was just pure butter straightout of the box in general just will beused to from flying ebooks and anotherthing I noticed was that just like onthe vapor as well I got this bit ofweird like chafing on top of the softbecause of the tape I got a blister andI'm not used to that in 2018 but thenJohn says there's also the matter thatyou repeat itthere's the durability so far we haven'thad any problems but since the soleplateis actually underneath the upper wedon't know how well it's gonna last inthe long run but again so far so good[Music]these are only small issues in a premiumbooth only and what made me think themost is the fact that the superfly inthe vapor and now so close to each otherthe Superfly 6 is an absolutelybrilliant poof it's really no denying itin fact it's so good that if it wasn'tfor the vapor 12 this would easily beone of my favorite piece out there butthey super fly to me has always beenabout this incredibly extraordinary thiswild array giuse lee innovative and Ihaven't made my mind up yet maybe thatspeaks for itself but it's the Superflysix really Superfly enough to be a superfly or should it just up in the vapor 12D F instead pocket philosophy aside bothJoe and myself could agree on the factthat the Superfly 6 these are very goodbecause not only is the best performingsuper fly ever made it's also a superfly that can be worn and enjoyed by morepeople with different food shapesexactly and you and me curious obviouslyI never thought I would see the day meneither but seriously man let's agree onnever ever ever ever meeting in dreamsagain yeah I agree okay but guys what doyou think about the Superfly 6 youshould let us know

my god am I gonna break this you go inthere okay oh it steals me Nikesintroducing its second version of itsself lacing hyperadapt shoes the adaptBB and this pair is a lot moreaffordable at $350 pairs over Bluetoothand remembers how tight you like yourshoes it's a ton of Technology packedright under the arch of your foot peopleare probably going to buy it Andros justlike they do with most any other Nikeshoe but what does it mean when yourshoe acts more like a gadget we wantedto see what they're all about so we'rehere today at Nikes campus to try themoutokay so these are them this is aprototype version this is not thecolorway they're gonna be released inbut I've never worn these before I'venever won the first version either afterall this hype it's kind of hard okaythat's it let's see if I can press somebuttons now we're tightening oh it'sgonna give you my foot a hug yeah ismuch tighter kidding guys picture LeBrondoing this at the sidelines during thegame pressing down on his buttonsalthough these were neat to try on andunlike any other shoe I've ever worn I'mnot convinced self-lacing shoes over thefuture so I chatted with Nike visionarylongtime designer of the Jordans and thecreator behind the self-lacing shoesconcept Tinker Hatfield I was invitedinto the process of designing productsfor Back to the Future 2 it justoccurred to me a shoe that would comealive when you touch it and itrecognizes you essentially adapts to youseem like a very out-there futuristicidea but on the other hand it alsoseemed like it would be doable at somepoint time releases all right the Backto the Future shoe is just a propthere are people controlling the shoethrough strings below the floor actualself-lacing shoes didn't come out untilthe Nike mags in 2016 then a few monthslater the hyperadapt 1.0 is followedthis third version refines everythingfrom those two shoes and gets the hyperight after ready for a wide releasesuch a huge amount of effort andengineering that went into this motorand it's not just the invention of themotor but then it's how it's beenfinalized so we can build it for formany other people too you knowthis motor is key to making the shoemainstream the hyperadapt 1.0 had tonsof cables and wires connecting the lacesmotors and lights it was a tangleddelicate setup compare that to the adaptBB where the shoes technology has beencompletely re-engineered for massmanufacturing all the shoe needs to makeit smart is its lacing cable and laceengine the cables threaded through themotorized spool you see in the laceengine which then winds around the spoolmaking the shoe tighter all the techiestuff is in that engine too literallyeverything of course you don't thinkabout any of the tech inside when you'rewearing the shoes but that doesn'tchange the fact that you're walking ontop of a lithium ion battery and a bunchof other electronics that's a littlescary to meJordan rice engineer Piper adapt tellsme not to worry though and he walked methrough how the team tests the shoes tomake sure they won't explode so we putit out in the field we put it onathletes we put it on in double-aathletes semi-pro athletes athletes thatplay professionally overseas and comehome for the summer and then regularathletes playing hoops on Thursday nightwe literally beat it up really reallyhard right over top of the lace enginein the shoe all right so like vintagehyperadapt 2.0 so you mean like fiveyears oh yeah like five years I wore thehell out of mine but I'm ready to sellthem because the batteries that I can'tit doesn't matter about the app supportor anything it's just like I can'ttighten the shoes ever again right yeahI mean the the shoe is dependent on thislace engine there's not a manual lacingmethod for it in terms of battery decaymost of the batteries that you see decayand your normal devices do so becausethey're being charged and dischargedevery day and so you have a certainnumber of cycles you go through 365 ofthose on your phone in a year it wouldtake you a very long time at 10 to 14days battery life to goes through 365 onthese Jordan thinks this shoe isn'tgoing to die anytime soon in any way theshoe is smart enough that we'll alwayssave enough battery to unlace worst casescenario though you can check yourbattery life through the app and controlsome other things pair it over Bluetoothand then it'll do a quick tighten loosenon your feet to sense kind of theoptimal setting once you have a settingyou like you can also set a modesave it self-lacing shoes are a reallyinteresting idea that anyone who geeksout on tech or sneakers will probablywant to try personally I'm not going torush out to buy these shoes because I'mnot a sneaker head and I'm not abasketball player these just aren't theright shoes for me right now but Nikereally seems to believe these are thefuture we've learned how to make shoes alot better so they don't stretch as muchbut they want to everybody wants freshnew shoes all the time our next goalwill will be to make this and morecolors and more styles if somebodyswitched shoes we would like them toswim and they would probably like toswitch to another shoe that has the samesame technology in it Nike clearly hasgrander plans for this technology andyou can even see hints of it in the namea dot B B stands for adaptive basketballso in the future a different kind ofshoe might have a different name like arunning shoe might be adapt our orsomething like that but even if thisadaptive fit technology doesn't take offit's not the end of the world Nike willgo on and civil laces and we'll makesure that that they're still cool shoeseven 20 years from now that have laceswe shake on that hold me to it if I'mstill kicking Oh dark yes hey thanks forgoing on this self-lacing journey withme tell me in the comments do you wantto wirelessly charge your shoes do youhate tying your shoes let me know and asalways stay locked to the verge for allthe future tech content you'll

today i'm going to be breaking down thenike sb bear brick collab and i'm goingto tell you why i think they're flyingunder the radar right now we'll talkabout that a little bit more in thevideo come on let's get it[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already hit thatsubscribe button join the familyjoin the squad don't forget to hit thelike button because that helps thealgorithm ohso much and with all that being saidit's time to talk about this shoestarting with the box you have yourmodern 2020 sbrainbow vibes all over the box big nikesb logo here on the topand on the size tag it reads nike sbdunk low ogquick strike black black white retail100so opening up the box as expected we gotour wood grain paper right here and thenwe have the shoeoh we have the shoe so before i getstarted breaking down the shoe andtalking about the materials and thedetails and the cuts and everything likethat we need to talk about bear breakfirstbecause a lot of people don't even knowwhat bear brick is where it comes fromor how this shoe even came about soessentially a bear break is somethinglike an art piece that has been collabedwith many of brands many of people manyof companiesover the years they started in 2001 andit was founded in tokyo the originalbear brick was all white and it just hadthe outside on it it was very verysimple and when they first launched theygave their bear bricks away at the worldcharacter convention out in tokyo andhonestly it's super dope to see how farthis brand has come over the past 20yearsi would say recently over the past 10years there has been a lot more hypewith people collecting it especiallywith sneaker heads and collectingdifferent itemsdifferent trinkets this is somethingthat's dope for an in-home displaya lot of people get the bigger size onesand when i talk about different sizeones there are different tiers to sizingyou have itty bitty ones and then youhave the large ones all the way up toone thousand percentthe prices are literally gonna rangefrom a couple bucks to literally acouple hundred to a couple thousanddollarsfor the retail value and then the resalecan obviously go up depending on thecollaboration and whatever it may be sowhen we see a collaboration with thisit's kind of dope to see them takingtheir collaboration from their toy andactually doing it with the sneaker andthen now releasing a sneaker and a toythat comes with the shoei was not able to get the bear brickthat comes with these in particular buthere's a photo so you can see what itlooks like this is not the firstcollaboration with nike and bear brickwe have seen other ones over the pastcouple years2017 2018 those also came with bearbreaks and special boxes differentsituations like thatsometimes they have the regular releaseand then special pack with the box andall the different trinkets and all thestuff that goes with it typically thatcauses the sneaker to be worth a littlebit more because you get the entire setplus the toy and everything that comeswith it i'm ready to show you guys ashoe enough talking let's get into itstarting with the outsole you have aall-gray outsole something that i'm veryhappy about because typically when youwear a shoe with a white outsole it getsdirty immediately and you can reallytell the difference when the shoe isdirty or notso for this having the gray outsoledefinitely a bonus working our way up tothe midsole we have all white midsolewith a black stitchall the way around the shoe and then tothe upper i think this is a very dopehitall pony hair around the entire uppermainly black and then you have a bearbreak at sign here on the back of theheel and you have a gray pony hair witha gray stitch here with the nike on theback around the heel as wellanother dope touch is the at bear bricksign here on the tongueinstead of the nike sb you still haveyour fat nike sbtongue right here and one thing that ireally really love i don't know aboutyou but personally when they have aleather sock liner and a shoeit just feels a little bit morecomfortable a little bit more premiumand i like it just a little bit more sowhen i look at the white leather sockliner right hereoh my god these shoes come equipped withtwo different laces you have your fatblack laces and you have your fat whitelacesthe white laces have a silver tip onthem the black laces have a gold tip onthem here's a look at the bottom of theinsole and here's a look at the top ofthe insolei love the detailing it's almost kind ofgot like that laser vibe like when theydo it on the jordans this one is justactually bare bricks everywhere in alight gray print and then you have yournike sb with your bear brick logo rightunderneath that20 20 medicom toy yeah these are fireso there isn't too too much to go overwhen it comes to the color and thedetails and all those things becauseit's pretty simple right you got yourblack pony hair all over the shoe andthen you got your subtle hits around itbut honestly the simplicity behind thissneakeris so clean to me i like dark shoes ilike black shoesfor something like this to come out i'mso happy with it and honestly i thinkthis shoe is undervaluedyes it's worth around 500 550 bucksright now but i think over timethis could go back up in value it washidden for 800 to a thousand dollarsoriginally when it first came out but ithink this shoe just fellunder the radar a lot of people didn'treally realize it was coming out there'sbeen so many sb's so many dunks jordansall these different releases stuffreleasing on random days these didn'tcome out on the weekend eitherso because of that some people weren'teven paying attention we had kobe weekso many other factorsand i get it there's just a lot of shoescoming out but me personally i thinkthat these flew under the radar and ithink if you can get them for 500 orunder right now i think that's a greatdealjust because i think they will go up invalue drop a comment down below and letme know what you think about the pricedo you think these are going to go up doyou think they're going to go down doyou think they're going to see it how doyou feel about this shoe i know some ofthe other bear brick sb's weren't asdope as these or maybe they were to youbut i think to me they weren'ti think this one is very very clean ithink this is probably the bestcollaboration that they have done so farbut again let me know what you thinkabout that in the comment section butbecause of those and the value that theyholdpeople might think that these might notgo as high but i think once peoplerealize likeyo this shoe was hard to get it is okaykind of dope once i see it in persongive it a little bit of time next thingyou know800 900 000 shoe so i went to instagramlike i always do if you haven't alreadyfollow me on igon there i like to post different thingson my story that i don't post hereget some different results from pollsand then post them on the videos and letyou guys see what everybody thinksso what i always do is i ask people isthis shoe fire or is this shoe trashi let the people vote

gonnabuy some more Nike stuff for some peoplethey make a big issue over little thingsthat's wrong if you sit down during thenational anthem and you don't stand upbut this kneeling down it's okay when Iwas teaching and I had students whoweren't gonna say the Pledge I askedthem to step outside we will all standand show respect to the country and youcan do that in private it's notdisrespecting your country if you areusing it as a form of protest we havethat right the video showing peopleovercoming physical challenges isamazing I'm not behind him he has nophysical handicap and yet he's using hisfootball and his football Fame toprotest something that is very very dearto many people so campaign caused manyto weigh in on social media right so wedo have a few of those responses to showI bet I bet they're both positive andnegative first the NFL forces me tochoose between my favorite spot in mycountry I choose country then Nikeforces me to choose between my favoriteshoes in my country since when did theAmerican flag and the national anthembecome offensive I'm gonna go with thisguy they didn't buy Nike to begin withbut I'd be less inclined to buy them nowhe's got a very good point there they'retrying to mix two different things that- andone shouldn't have any effect on theother I really don't see anything wrongwith it it's like a respect and you knowwhen you go and pray to God you kneeldown I think there's nothing wrong withit so you will destroy something ratherthan give it to someone who needs it Idon't understand why people feel thatthat's a choice there's a lot of

already soldthem and made money Wyeth why shouldthey care just means that eventuallysomebody will come around and buy morethat's an idea if you think America'sveterans deserve more respect why notdonate your clothes to a veteran'scharity instead of cutting them up withscissors like a dumb spiteful littlebrat I'm with you Matthew amen I agreegood idea I like that I can't seeturn up good shoes for their Nike or youknow from JC Penney's for pete's sakestop using the mm excuse to burn yourNikes I'm not your scapegoat I'm gonnasit over here and continue to buy myNike stuff they give military a discountwhen I leave this studio I'm gonna buyme a big Nike certain I'm gonna wear iteverywhereyeah good using the veterans which youuse in the military I hate whenpoliticians do that it's okay Nike givesdiscounts to military I honor that Idon't honor their advertising Oh Nikedone stepped in it now sanctions to bedeterminedyeah well he's being sarcastic that ishilarious seems like he thinks that it'sa bold move and that it's going to bringsome negative reactions as well as somepositive ones Kelly Clarkson to thankyou stood a one thank you Nike forsimply backing what you believed in oneof the best parts about this country isthe freedom we have to express ourselvesthat's right 16 years ago today thepeople of America changed my life and Iwill be forever grateful andappreciative well now that's thepositivity that we need in the worldmy aunt Kelly she's wide awake what shehas in mind is what I have in mind -it's a free countryBill O'Reilly oh I can hardly wait tohear what ya say Oh didn't even get introuble himself for something heshouldn't have done a while backremember when calling cabinet war socksthat he picked at police officers aspigs okay I remember that so here's myquestion for Nike mister Kaepernick woresocks mocking Muslims or gays would hirehim to endorse your products well nowthere's an interesting connection nowwe're mocking so this is mockable thisis a mockable offense now okay hmmthat's more muckraking I don't careabout the negative why spend all thatnegative energy I'm being negative aboutsaying negative things Serena Williamsespecially proud to be part of the Nikefamily today hashtag just do it it's apositive message this Nike is puttingout everyone has a right to say whatthey believe in and the harder youbelieve in it stand tall with it I justAM standing tall with I think this isthe wrong move for Nike if we look athistory I mean let's try to remember the1968 Olympics they won medals and theystood on the platform and they raisedtheir hand in a and Black Power salutein protest of what was going on in thecountry and people just I think theylost their medals for that it's freespeech you have the right to state anopinion has often said the message ofkneeling is a peaceful protest to endpolice brutality and racial inequalitybut many still feel that these protestsare potentially anti-american andagainst the flag and the national anthemand the US military mm-hmm I would agreewith the latter if he thinks thatkneeling is going to be something that'sgonna stop all those things that hethinks it controls or can control he'sdead wrong and I think he has a right todo thatand he shouldn't have been uh ostracizedlike he was for doing that simple acteven though it was a stupid simple actI've waited on these issues notablyPresident Trump who frequently discussesthese issues he in my opinion he shouldbe supporting what they're protestingabout and in his position doingsomething about it some of the owners ofthe National Football League have beenbuzzing a policy banning players fromkneeling though many have violated thispolicy in the preseason and some NFLowners have even volunteered to pay anyfines given out related to this policyright good for them they're just tryingto say that you need to pay attention tothese things that are going on the worldand we need to correct them for youpersonally where do you stand on theprotests during the national anthem I donot agree with the protest during thenational anthem he can head up somethingthat that would be more in tune with hisviews his ideas and do it in a settingthat's appropriate this is notappropriate I don't think nobody shouldbe protesting because the issue of blackpeople being killed all the time I thinkit's our duty our responsibility tospeak out it's not only a right it's ourobligation to stand up when we seethings are wrong they choose to protestthere on that stage where they have mostof the attention of the world morepeople should be paying attention to theissue that they're protesting about youneed to show respect for the country butif you feel that you can't respect thecountry because of certain policies thatare in play you have the right toprotest I stand up I like tradition Ilike the flag I know the song by heartbut as the issue stands I do not likeNike I do not like the fact thatKaepernick has started this kneeling atthe national anthem and and taken awaymy enjoyment of a game the black protestis right but not there well thisspecific issue aside it feels liketoday's America any shoe seems to getboth liberal and conservative peoplevery upset with each other arguing andposting on social media etc they getcarried away in your experience in yourlife have you always felt that this wasthe case with both sides this polarizedor has it gotten worse over time I thinkto me it's always been this bad it'sjust that it's just more up front nowbecause of social media this is a lotmore than beforeduring my time people are fighting morepeople want to prove that they're rightwe've gone down a road of reducedcivility we used to be able to argue ina very polite and mature fashion and Ifeel like now we just have becomeyellers and screamers gotten worsebecause the president this president haspolarized our society the bad examplethat he sets going after people anybodythat opposes him anyone that speaks outhe goes out after them like a rabid dogit's built on a light or a dislike ofthe president ever since he was electedpresident there has been a massseparation about all things I do believeif we keep trying keep pushing forwardthat this will dissolve someday go backto the Nike campaign many have pointedout Kaepernick it has long beensponsored by Nike but wasn't the faceuntil now as an elder who's seen a lotof controversial campaigns over theyears what do you think this will do forNike overall long-term overall I thinkit's gonna have a negative impact justtoo far-reaching to put this kind ofnonsense out there all things areforgotten history goes on we'll havesomething big to deal with next week Ithink it would be good for them in thelong run Nike is more of a company thatrespects the long run it's gonna helpthem because I think all the people whohave destroyed their their Nikes aregonna end up going out and buying morebecause they're gonna be missing them sofinallythe NFL season kicking off this weekwhen do you see resolution to thisdispute happening and what do you thinkthat resolution will be I really don't Ihate to be cynical I really don't seeany reason there isn't Maddie it's gonnakeep on going until maybe there changesin the end the government I don't seeresolution this is a high-poweredmulti-billion dollar industry and Ithink what what's going to affect itmost are our ticket sales and Watchersand people of buy season tickets it'sgoing to end in a stalemate Nike will beokay Kaepernick will be okay as far asgetting back into pro football I got afeeling that might not happen ourpolitical leaders ought to get involvedin this to put our country at restconcerning a national anthemif that doesn't happen then where is aleadership coming we got actors it canbe role models they should speak up theeasiest resolution is to simply have theplayers not come out until after thenational anthem is played they may befrustrated that they can't protest butthen you're not gonna have people all inhysterics about it and then maybe we'llstart discussing why people areprotesting what the real reason is thoseplayers are pretty tough and they'restanding for what they're standing forand that's the way it's been throughoutcenturies you have to stand until therewas a difference made like FredrickDouglas said you have to agitate

hi everyone Kevin here from golf Groreviews and today we're looking at thenight tour premier golf shoe now thisshoes got quite a lot of unique featuresso I'm gonna go through some of thedetails I'm going to give you an on feetreview and then I'm gonna let you knowwhat I think so if you enjoy the videoplease hit that like button and feelfree to subscribe so you can keep up todate on all my latest review videos ofgolf shoes clothing and tech so first ofall let's take a look at the overalldesign and look of the shoe now I thinkthis is going to be very much a Marmiteshow you're either gonna love it oryou're gonna hate it and I have used asynthetic leather upper right across thewhole of the shoe and that's going togive you a two year at waterproofguarantee and the way that they've putthe upper together is using a fewdifferent techniques really so on partsof it you've got a seamless design herewhere you've got this piece of thinleather meeting this part of the toe boxand another part you've got seamsrunning across the shoes as well onething to note about the syntheticleather upper is that it is a very softfeeling upper it does feel very highquality to me across the toe box that'sreally nice and soft it's got a goodfeel to it and like the quality of thislittle patch across the left-hand sideof the toe box on the right shoe to helpwith the durability where you might rubyour toe across the grass when you swingand again the feeling of the sympatheticapart across the fast bit system feelsnice and high quality it's a decentlooking TPUand again around the ankle support thereof the foot it's nice and soft but itdoes feel good quality there of coursethe fast fit lacing system gives aslightly different aesthetic look to theshoe as well and you can see here thatthey've used this piece of the syntheticleather upper to cover the workings ofthe fast fit system which we'll go intoin a little bit more detail in a minuteso that's giving it a very unique styleof shoe so in certain parts of this showI think it can look a little bit big andchunky certainly on my feet I think itdoes but then also it's trying to look alittle bit sleek and stylish as wellwith the way that they've covered theworkings of the fast fit system so it'sa bit of a mishmash of styles to behonest and as I said I think you'reeither going to love it or you're gonnahate it so let me know what you thinkdown in the comments of this one I'vegot or admit I'm notthe biggest fan of the looks of this onefor me personally I'd either rather amore traditional looking show or I'dprefer at the other end of the spectruma more trainer style showI think this sits somewhere in betweenthe two and for me it's not what I wouldpersonally want to wear on the coursebut that's personal opinion there'splenty of people out there that lovethis show a lot of the professionalsusing it on tour at the momentpretty sure I sort of kept the last weekrocking a pair of these so you know whoam I to say but that's just my personalopinion on that oneso the real unique aspect of this shoethat we want to take a little bit morefocus on is the fast fit system so youcan see there's no usual style lacesyou've got this elasticated pull tab atthe front of the show so once you putthe shoe on you give it a good tug andit's pulling the inner lacing systemwhich is hidden under this piece ofleather here it's pulling that tighterin around the foot locking down yourfoot and then when it's time to take theshoes off you've got the red tab on theside you give that a good pull you heara slight click and that loosens it up onthe inside and you can slip your shoeoff easily now for me I'm a huge fan ofthe BOA lacing system and I'm alsocurrently gaming the Puma disc systemwhich really gives me a good lockdownfill and same with the night the fastfit system you can't deny it it givesyou a really really good fit rightacross the foot and it really locks downyour foot in the show when it comes tothe design and the style of the lacingsystem I've not got a problem with theelasticated vent it's a different way togo for me personally again I think Iprefer the look and the mechanisms thatyou use in the twist based systems thatare out there on the market but in termsof lock down and fit it's doing the samejob and I can't fault it whatsoever forthat my foot feels just as a lockdown inthis show as it does any of the otherlaceless systems out there on the marketone thing I'm not entirely keen on to behonest is where they've tried to hide orthey have hidden the internal workingsof the fast fit system you can see thatactually it still protruding from theleather that it's covering andfor me I would rather not see any of itat all or have a system where it's moreintegrated in the design of the showcomfort wise the night tour premier isusing a fine on midsole all the waythrough the length now that's a you knowthat suspended Mike midsole is beentested for years it's nice and soft it'snice as comfortable there are softer midsells on the market for me night capsoff the mid soles in the marketpersonally I prefer the feel of theLunarlon foam I also prefer the feel ofthe react foam which is a far newerconstruction just created my opinionmoney to compete with the adidas boostmidsole this gives a good amount ofsupport it's not too soft it's not toofirm the midsole gives a nice bit ofcomfort on the inside of the show you'vegot a really good amount of paddingactually this is really quite a heavilypadded show on the inside you've got agood amount around the ankle you've gota good around around the hill and thetoe actually feels quite significantlypadded I think that's possibly to reduceany feelings of the fast fit mechanismthat lies in front of it but there doesa good job and it really does securelykeep your foot in place if anything Ifound that the shoe actually run quitesmall for meI mean you canine which is what I've gotthis in when I put it on I instantlyfeel that I need a bigger size the toebox did feel quite cramped for me when Iwas using a normal pair of my sportsoxide wear for golf so personally Iwould go up half a size and then you canmake use of the fit system to make surethat your foot is lots of nicely inplace also on comfort when you look atthe midsole that they've got in thereyou've got to be honestquite a bog-standard midsole runningthrough there there's no special pointswhere there's increased padding at allto help with the comfort and it's notoverly thick it's pretty bog-standard inmy opinion and which is a little bitdisappointing for a shoe that currentlyretails at 170 pound in terms oftraction the soleplate has got a TPUbase and you've got seven of thesecleats they're plastics pipes in therethat are going to give you plenty oftraction there's nothing too funky orunique goingwith the soleplate there you've got someof these raised points across the wholecell plate which reminds me a little bitof the react or a little bit of the Gtour that naik also put out but they'renot as they're not severe they're not asharsh as those shows so your mainelement subtraction is going to becoming from the spikes we've a littlebit of the rotational traction comingfrom the soleplate but again I think itlooks nice on this black version thatI've got here it's nice and plain thereare different color ways that theseshoes got going for it as well there's awhite version there's an energy versionor energy version and there's a whiteand teal version I believe that I sawout there as well but this is the blackversion which would look nice and smartwith a pair of trousers I'm not sure I'dpersonally be able to pull this off witha pair of shorts I think these areslightly too big and bulky for me to bewearing with a pair of shorts but againthat's totally up to you I've got littleskinny legs that I don't think couldcarry them off but it doesn't mean thatother people out there can't I thinkthere's not going to be too much of anissue it just depends on your personaltaste so with the night tour premiere onthe feet I think from a side profilethey're actually quite a good lookingshoe and they're on the more traditionalend of a style of show to be fair ratherthan the trainer style but then when youlook at them from the top that's whenyou see the different contrasts of thetextures that they've used here with thedifferent parts of the synthetic leatherupper and for me it's quite a busylooking shoe from the top even thoughthese are plain black and you can stillsee as I mentioned before in a videothat the top piece of leather is hidingthe fast fit technology on the insideagain you can kind of see a little bitas well where that piece of leather hasbeen used to cover the facet system itdoesn't sit flush on the show there'sparts that are raised you can just seeon the inside a little bit of the firstlace that's kind of protruding from theedge of it so you just get a littlehidden a little peek at the technologythat's going on underneath again that'sa style choice that night I've decidedto make personally I would havepreferred it if it was fitting flush andtruly covered it and didn't show meanything whatsoever but that's uptonight and the wayhave chosen

together is using a fewdifferent techniques really so on partsof it you've got a seamless design herewhere you've got this piece of thinleather meeting this part of the toe boxand another part you've got seamsrunning across the shoes as well onething to note about the syntheticleather upper is that it is a very softfeeling upper it does feel very highquality to me across the toe box that'sreally nice and soft it's got a goodfeel to it and like the quality of thislittle patch across the left-hand sideof the toe box on the right shoe to helpwith the durability where you might rubyour toe across the grass when you swingand again the feeling of the sympatheticapart across the fast bit system feelsnice and high quality it's a decentlooking TPUand again around the ankle support thereof the foot it's nice and soft but itdoes feel good quality there of coursethe fast fit lacing system gives aslightly different aesthetic look to theshoe as well and you can see here thatthey've used this piece of the syntheticleather upper to cover the workings ofthe fast fit system which we'll go intoin a little bit more detail in a minuteso that's giving it a very unique styleof shoe so in certain parts of this showI think it can look a little bit big andchunky certainly on my feet I think itdoes but then also it's trying to look alittle bit sleek and stylish as wellwith the way that they've covered theworkings of the fast fit system so it'sa bit of a mishmash of styles to behonest and as I said I think you'reeither going to love it or you're gonnahate it so let me know what you thinkdown in the comments of this one I'vegot or admit I'm notthe biggest fan of the looks of this onefor me personally I'd either rather amore traditional looking show or I'dprefer at the other end of the spectruma more trainer style showI think this sits somewhere in betweenthe two and for me it's not what I wouldpersonally want to wear on the coursebut that's personal opinion there'splenty of people out there that lovethis show a lot of the professionalsusing it on tour at the momentpretty sure I sort of kept the last weekrocking a pair of these so you know whoam I to say but that's just my personalopinion on that oneso the real unique aspect of this shoethat we want to take a little bit morefocus on is the fast fit system so youcan see there's no usual style lacesyou've got this elasticated pull tab atthe front of the show so once you putthe shoe on you give it a good tug andit's pulling the inner lacing systemwhich is hidden under this piece ofleather here it's pulling that tighterin around the foot locking down yourfoot and then when it's time to take theshoes off you've got the red tab on theside you give that a good pull you heara slight click and that loosens it up onthe inside and you can slip your shoeoff easily now for me I'm a huge fan ofthe BOA lacing system and I'm alsocurrently gaming the Puma disc systemwhich really gives me a good lockdownfill and same with the night the fastfit system you can't deny it it givesyou a really really good fit rightacross the foot and it really locks downyour foot in the show when it comes tothe design and the style of the lacingsystem I've not got a problem with theelasticated vent it's a different way togo for me personally again I think Iprefer the look and the mechanisms thatyou use in the twist based systems thatare out there on the market but in termsof lock down and fit it's doing the samejob and I can't fault it whatsoever forthat my foot feels just as a lockdown inthis show as it does any of the otherlaceless systems out there on the marketone thing I'm not entirely keen on to behonest is where they've tried to hide orthey have hidden the internal workingsof the fast fit system you can see thatactually it still protruding from theleather that it's covering andfor me I would rather not see any of itat all or have a system where it's moreintegrated in the design of the showcomfort wise the night tour premier isusing a fine on midsole all the waythrough the length now that's a you knowthat suspended Mike midsole is beentested for years it's nice and soft it'snice as comfortable there are softer midsells on the market for me night capsoff the mid soles in the marketpersonally I prefer the feel of theLunarlon foam I also prefer the feel ofthe react foam which is a far newerconstruction just created my opinionmoney to compete with the adidas boostmidsole this gives a good amount ofsupport it's not too soft it's not toofirm the midsole gives a nice bit ofcomfort on the inside of the show you'vegot a really good amount of paddingactually this is really quite a heavilypadded show on the inside you've got agood amount around the ankle you've gota good around around the hill and thetoe actually feels quite significantlypadded I think that's possibly to reduceany feelings of the fast fit mechanismthat lies in front of it but there doesa good job and it really does securelykeep your foot in place if anything Ifound that the shoe actually run quitesmall for meI mean you canine which is what I've gotthis in when I put it on I instantlyfeel that I need a bigger size the toebox did feel quite cramped for me when Iwas using a normal pair of my sportsoxide wear for golf so personally Iwould go up half a size and then you canmake use of the fit system to make surethat your foot is lots of nicely inplace also on comfort when you look atthe midsole that they've got in thereyou've got to be honestquite a bog-standard midsole runningthrough there there's no special pointswhere there's increased padding at allto help with the comfort and it's notoverly thick it's pretty bog-standard inmy opinion and which is a little bitdisappointing for a shoe that currentlyretails at 170 pound in terms oftraction the soleplate has got a TPUbase and you've got seven of thesecleats they're plastics pipes in therethat are going to give you plenty oftraction there's nothing too funky orunique goingwith the soleplate there you've got someof these raised points across the wholecell plate which reminds me a little bitof the react or a little bit of the Gtour that naik also put out but they'renot as they're not severe they're not asharsh as those shows so your mainelement subtraction is going to becoming from the spikes we've a littlebit of the rotational traction comingfrom the soleplate but again I think itlooks nice on this black version thatI've got here it's nice and plain thereare different color ways that theseshoes got going for it as well there's awhite version there's an energy versionor energy version and there's a whiteand teal version I believe that I sawout there as well but this is the blackversion which would look nice and smartwith a pair of trousers I'm not sure I'dpersonally be able to pull this off witha pair of shorts I think these areslightly too big and bulky for me to bewearing with a pair of shorts but againthat's totally up to you I've got littleskinny legs that I don't think couldcarry them off but it doesn't mean thatother people out there can't I thinkthere's not going to be too much of anissue it just depends on your personaltaste so with the night tour premiere onthe feet I think from a side profilethey're actually quite a good lookingshoe and they're on the more traditionalend of a style of show to be fair ratherthan the trainer style but then when youlook at them from the top that's whenyou see the different contrasts of thetextures that they've used here with thedifferent parts of the synthetic leatherupper and for me it's quite a busylooking shoe from the top even thoughthese are plain black and you can stillsee as I mentioned before in a videothat the top piece of leather is hidingthe fast fit technology on the insideagain you can kind of see a little bitas well where that piece of leather hasbeen used to cover the facet system itdoesn't sit flush on the show there'sparts that are raised you can just seeon the inside a little bit of the firstlace that's kind of protruding from theedge of it so you just get a littlehidden a little peek at the technologythat's going on underneath again that'sa style choice that night I've decidedto make personally I would havepreferred it if it was fitting flush andtruly covered it and didn't show meanything whatsoever but that's uptonight and the wayhave chosen to style the show so tosummarize the night tour premiere golfshoe this is a premium spiked golf shoethat's looking for the top end of themarket really in terms of the looks-wiseyou're either gonna love it or you'regonna hate it hope I've given you enoughinformation there so you can start tomake a decision for yourself the fastfit system locks down across the shoenice and tight it's an alternative tothe BOA and the other disc based systemsout there in terms of fit it locks itdown in my opinion just as good in termsof looks I'm not so keen personally butthat's totally up to you it does fitnicely and seamlessly in with the shoethey've done a good job with the designjust personally I'm not overly keen onthe way that this piece of syntheticupper is covering the system and you canstill kind of see the lumps and bumpsunderneath fit wise it's a nice andcomfortable showit's your foot is nice and locked in allthe way through I don't think you'd haveany problems with comfort and lastingfor a full 18 holes of golf that beingsaid I believe that there are morecomfortable night shoes out there on themarket retailing at less than this oneso for this currently retailing foraround 179 pounds in the UK I thinkthere are alternatives that wascertainly warrant new considering but ifyou truly love the style and you want tohave the latest night golf shoes outthere on the course then

today we have a very special unboxingi'm excited to open these things up andsee how dope they really are[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already go ahead andhit that subscribe button join thefamily join the squad you already knowwhat to do manand don't forget to hit that thumbs upbutton because you know that helps thealgorithm owe so much but with all thatbeing saidwe got two dope shoes right here solet's go ahead and crack these thingsopenand see what they're really talkingabout so starting with the box as youcan see it's got that rainbow print withthe more exclusive sbboxes we have seen it has come with thisstyle right here we have been typicallyseeing a sbbox similar to something like this andthat right here is like on a strangelove sbthat we've seen before in the past thisalso did come with the rainbow boxbut that was more exclusive on thatversion just for the boxnow i don't know if that really changesthe value of the shoe in my eyesbut for some people it does so crackingopen this first box we got the woodgrain paper right here for the sband we have the yellow colorway righthere looking ohso clean and in this box we have anotherone with the wood grain paperand we have the orange colorway lookingoh so cleanwell at least in some people's eyesbecause i'm not exactly sure how i feelabout these ones so for those of youguys that do not know this is thegrateful dead nike sbcollab and they have their dancing bearsthat they represent here on the insoleand on the tongues of the shoes now theyhave three different colorways that arecoming outthe yellow the orange and then the greenand apparentlythey're supposedly a blue and a pinkpair because they have two differentversions on the insoles of these shoesbut that does not mean they're actuallycoming out there have been a lot ofpeoplegetting fakes and selling them as realso when it comes to this shoe inparticularespecially the price of this sneakermake sure that you pay attention andunderstand thatthe pink and the blue is not a thingright now you either have yelloworange or green i want you to make surethat you know thatso you don't get yourself into troublespending money on a shoe that is notrealso i want to get started with the yellowshoe first and i'll save the orange onefor last because i know a lot of peoplelike the orange one a little bit morefor some reason at least the value sayssobut me personally i love the yellowversion so we gotta go with these onesfirststarting with the outsole you have allbaby blue outsole with the yellow nikesbbranding here and the mid foot workingour way up to the midsole we have ayellow midsole with the yellow stitchand then on to the upper i think this isone of the most interesting things aboutthis shoe becausea lot of people think this is like somenew miraculous designbut then they forgot about the threebears pack when you had the papa bearthe mama bear and the little bearand the sb's from back in the day andi'm like this waswhat immediately is what i thought ofwhen i saw this collaboration coming iwas like yo that's the little bears packand a whole new versionand then other people are like wait whatis that if you don't know make sure youcheck those out from the past i'm prettysure those are probably worth a prettypenny nowto me this is like another rendition ofthat version of the packand where they went with it with thebear style and everything like that solooking at the yellow suede right hereis pretty nice it's pretty solidand then obviously you have your barematerials here on the tongue on the midfoot and then here wrapping around theback sideone dope thing that i do really loveabout this shoe though is the swoosh ithink the characterthat they bring to the swoosh with thedesign with the jagged edges similar tothe collar around the bear's neck i feellike that's really dope to see itbrought to life and now put onto theshoe like thatanother dope thing that a lot of peoplelove is the tongue if you look righthere it has a zipper that wraps all theway around the top of the tongue righthereand then you have your stash pocket andit's fully padded but the stash pocketactually goes all the way into thebottom of the laces right hereso you can put damn near a phone in hereif you wanted to but i don't think youcould fit a phone in here but you coulddefinitely put somesome money or some narcotics orsomething else like that butthat you shouldn't put no narcotics inthere i'm just saying people be doingthat sothat sometimes with that all right we'regoing to just we're going tostop that conversation right now soanyways back to the shoeas you can see it's essentially all overyellow and then you got your dope babyblue hits around the shoejust looking at the images andeverything like that hopefully thathelps you get a little bit better visionof the quality and everything behind theshoeit is very interesting i don't knowabout the price of why it is so muchthere's a lot of hype behind nike sbright now in bruh these things are goingfor way too much in my opinion and ithink that's what brings us to this onethe orange paircan you believe these are going for evenmore than the yellow pairi don't know about you but for somereason when it comes to orange shoes itjust doesn't hit that hard for me likei'm just not that big of a fan of itso when i think about the orange one i'mlike these are like last on the listlike i would go yellowgreen orange and for some reason theorange is the one that everybody wantsdrop a comment down below and let meknow why the orange oneis the one everybody wants is it becausethere's less pairs that are madeis it because the colorway is just alittle bit better than the other ones isit because a certain celebrity warm andit caused the price to go up please letme know what you think about this orangepair down below in the comment sectionso looking at the orange pair as you cansee you kind of got like ai would say neon green type color forthe outsole and then you got your orangenike sb hit right here and then going tothe midsole orange with the orangestitch and then all orange on the uppersame materials everything's the samewhen it comes to these two shoesonly thing different is the colorwayboth shoes come with the extra pair oflaces so on here you got the yellowlaces that comestandard and then the blue laces thatcome additional and then on here you gotthe orange laces that come standard inthe green laces that come as anadditional lacepretty dope i think they might look alittle bit oh no actually i'll take thatbut nah i think these might look dopewith the blue laces low-key i feel likethese might be fire with the blue lacesso like i was saying before if you lookat the insole right here you can see youhave the yellowthe green the blue the orange and thepink so we've seen the yellow and thegreen release and then the orange is theopportunity to release as wellbut we haven't seen anything withofficial images with a blue and a pinkpairso make sure you stay tuned with thatbut a lot of people have the assumptionsthey're gonna end up releasing all fivecolorwaysso a lot of people are able to get awaywith murder by letting people think ohyeah they got the pink pair oh yeah theygot the blue pairno bro watch out for those trust me wheni tell you this i have to keep sayingthis becausethere's a lot of people that are gettingscammed right now and i want to makesure that you guys are protected fromthis becausebro there's people on ig right now theygot these shoeswithout the box without the tag all thestuff and talking about oh it's from theplug yeah all right bro why is it fromthe plug and it ain't got noyeah i'm not i'm not even gonna starti'm not even gonna startit just pisses me off to see how yeahpeople are getting over that's all i'msaying sorry i'm getting off topic butman i just hate to see that happen topeopleso overall what do you guys think aboutthese two shoes i asked the people on igand this is what they said 61 went withthe yellow 39went with the orange but it'sinteresting because the orange is worthso much morethan the yellow pair and i'm confusedpeople like this one morebut these is worth more i still don'tunderstand that concept it happens withsneakers all the timesomeone please explain it to me onething that i do think is super dopeabout grateful deadand the shirts that they have done overthe years especially like when they hadthat kind ofcollaboration with lithuania and thebasketball team and they had the tiedeye teasand then everybody used that inspirationto create their own tied it's over theyearsso they have definitely had a hugeimpact on the cultureand everything behind it it's just a lotof people in this time in this erai don't think they're really big fans ofgrateful dead and didn't really careabout grateful dead until they saw thiscollaboration knowing that nike sb ispopping right nowand it's definitely a very uniquecolorway pretty rarehard to get so because that the pricestarts to skyrocket because of the hypeand everything behind it now do i thinkthese shoes is worth that muchno but retail being a hundred bucks andyou can get this shoe for a hundreddollarsand then potentially make a flip or havea very dope sneakerthat is worth a lot of money why notgrab it if you have a chance it onlymakes sense rightme personally i would probably rankthese shoes at like alet's say 500 to 700 value when it comesto these sneakersthat's what i think they would be worthmax now my valuedoesn't mean nothing because everybodyelse clearly thinks these are worthmultiple thousands of dollars soagain whatever i say don't really matteri just know personally i would neverspend resaleon these sneakers that's all i'm sayingi wouldn't do it it's up to you you cando whatever you want but i just know meretail 100 bucks yeah 500 700 buckscool but they got to be legit because iain't doing that whole likei got the sneaker without the box theycame from my plug they came in thisclear plastic bag yeah all right bro soanyways with all that being said i hopeyou guys enjoyed this video i hope youguys enjoyed this reviewthe video dropped today the shoesdropped today so if you guys got anyluck and was able to get these shoes letme know down below in the commentsection good luck to everybody in theresale market as welltrying to either flip them or purchasethem everybody you knowi can't i can't be mad at you i can'tknock the hustle because if you had anopportunity to buy a sneaker for ahundred dollarsand sell it for 3 000 i mean i'm justnot mad at you brothat's just a great return i just idon't even know what to tell you that'sjustit's a good day all right you guys myname is dj i'm signing out i gots to goi'm gone[Music]peacesoyou,17,UCUFgkRb0ZHc4Rpq15VRCICA,Nike,31,17,0,689,"['nike commercial', 'nike', 'naomi

games happywhen you don't feel that it's becauseyou're notyou're not want to play more footballbut i'm stillhungry to play football a passion toscore goalsto do it uh assistance you know becausei lovei still love a lot the sport thismindset this mentality that you've gottowards how youoperate as a professional and to be thebest do you think that's something thatsomebody could learn somebody a youngkid could you could you could teach themor is that something that's just youcan't teachbut it's it's it should come from fromyouyou understand because it's it's you ifyou know that don't help yourselfit's difficult another person help youyou understand they can advise youbut should coming from you now is myopinion okay christhank you for your insights let's wrapthis up now because we've got sometraining to doright cristiano this drill is all aboutspeed both weaving without the ballokay so you're ready to get into it yepokayfirst lose your marker and race to theball of your choosingdribble around the cones as they'redropped in your pathbeat the mannequin and hit the targetthen sprint around the oppositemannequinfinish the through ballyou ready yep okay that's it and then gowhen you wantgood one on the other side good hold onhand that one good attack defender goodnice good great finish that's it show methat speed and then first time finishgreat workyou have to work on your accelerationand rapid change of direction to loseyour markersbeing in control of the ball at speed isvitalwork on having the composure to finishat speed and then being alive to thenext opportunity[Music]i'm at cobham chelsea fc's traininggrand here in west londonwith none other than sam kerr sowe're gonna start off if we can take itback to perth and australia where didthe dream start for you to want tobecome a professional footballeryeah i think i started a bit lateprobably than most peopleum didn't start playing football until iwas 12 but i always had that dream ofwanting to be a professional athletefromfrom when i can remember really sofootball a bit of a late bloomer butalways wanted to bea top athlete would you would you saythat where you are now is more of aproduct of hard work or talenti always get this question um nohonestly i think it's a bit of both ithinkum i'm very naturally gifted i come froma family that has a lot of sportingability butum there's no i'm not gonna lie i've putin so much work and i felt like becausei started like i've alwaysbeen trying to kind of play catch up sofor me i've always had that kind ofunderdog hard work hard work mentalityto try and catch up becausei kind of say that i'm always a littlebit behind okay socan you tell us about anybody that'sinspired you anybody within the gamethat's inspired youlike inspired your journey into footballoh i mean there'sthere's plenty along with a row but imean my idol growing up froma young angle is obviously i say thegoat nowronaldo what is it that inspired youabout him or still inspires you today asa pro playeryeah i think the thing that kind ofstands out for me is his consistencyover the years i thinkas an athlete i understand how hard itis to stay at the top of your game forso many years and he's consistently doneit whether he's beenin the premier league whatever leaguehe's in reallywhatever team national team club team healways performs andi appreciate how hard that is to do thatfor as many years as he hasyeah so when we talk about trainingmentality as well what's your mindsetgoing into making sure every sessioncounts and you get the most out of ityeah i think for me it's just aboutcompetition i always make littlecompetitions whether it's between peopleon my team the otherthe other team that we're playingagainst but for me it's about how can iget better to help the teami think every day at training for me isan opportunity to get better if i don'tget enough in trainingi'll definitely be there after trainingdoing something wherever i cani've always got that mentality to do alittle bit extra sohow did you get on with your trainingschedule or or staying fit and on top ofyour game during lockdown how was thatfor youyeah it was it was difficult i thinkyou know obviously with the club beingclosed andrestrictions on a lot of things a lot offootball fields were closedgoals taken down so for me it was justaboutmaintaining my fitness my speed andagility and doing things that i couldcontrol reallyit's not always going to be smoothsailing where you have the club orfacilities to kind of do everything youhave to make upas you go and especially in women'sfootball i feel like that's been a thingso for meit was tough but we're used to that nowwhat's your mindset going into a gameoh i mean just my mindset going intoevery game is to score goals but it'salso to beatbeat whoever i'm playing on win myindividual battle and it goes back towhat i said beforejust about being the best version ofmyself for the teamso it's just about winning my individualbattle and how can i make people aroundme better as well asplaying well i think mentalpreparation's just as important asyour physical preparation taking care ofyour body and all those things butnormally on the bus if we're travelingor the night before the game i'mwatching film whether it's onthe goalkeeper the two center boxwhatever it is i'm i'm watching andtaking it as much as i can as well asbeing you know ready and kind of freeinside my mind for when i step out onthe fieldwhat would you say is the the strongestattribute that you've got toyou're the strongest part of your gameum i think getting in behindruns in behind is definitely mystrongest part i think my movement offthe balli also think i wear people down so maybei won't score in the first 20 minutes 30minutes 40 minutes butit's it's relentless um 70th 80th 90thminute they're gonna they're gonna crackat some pointright and samsung we're gonna head offand do some training shortly so let'swrap it up one last questionwhat advice would you give to a aspiringyoung player who wants to follow theirdreamyeah i think for me it's always thatnothing comes easythere's going to be a lot of ups butalso a lot of downs soyou've got to be mentally prepared butat the end of the day if you love whatyou doyou'll never work a day in your lifethat's what i always sayfor a top striker the ability to movequickly around the edge of the box iskeythis drill is going to test your speedyour reactions and most importantly yourability to put the ball in the back ofthe netnumber four cones one to four left torightcoach calls a number as you play aone-two passthe attacker sprints to that card andrepeats twice moreafter the final sprint attack thedefender and scoreready let's go two goodwell done four

donegood being good in the air is about morethan just having a big jumpthis one starts with challenging yourreactions and working your timing andathleticismthen it's all about keeping your eye onthe ball and timing your lead[Music]you've got to show the desire to getthere and commit to the headerhere we are in manchester with a playerwho's taken the premier league by stormsince his arrival in januaryportuguese star bruno fernandez welcomethank you very much timso first off i just want you to take usback to when you were a kidlike how did your dream start to becomea professional footballeri think like uh as every child you knowyou startwhen as when you are young you play towith your friends withwith family and also because i have abig brotherso i started to play with him my dad wasplaying football alsomy dream was always being football youknow so i thinki think the the first steps when youstart to playing with thepro not professional but have someleague games with yourwith your with your team and everythingyou want to be you want to arrive youknowyou start looking the the big playersnational team playersand you want to be there with them soyou're a player that people will likepeople will look at you and then you'llinspire them to to chase their dreamwhat players or or what what people didyou look up tooh for example in in the beginning i wasa big fan from ronaldinho you knowuh it was that that player who gives thethe joy to look at him to look forfootball games you know the biggestexample i follow was cristiano like isaid before ina lot of interviews as a professionalas as a person and and of course as afootballerwas the dream like i want to follow hissteps it's not likei will be like cristiano i want to belike cristiano but i i want to havethe same mentality he has he has to bebetter and better every day to trainingharder toto be focus on what you can improve moreand as a professional like for mecristiano was thethe dream to achieve i've been lookingto know you since you sort offirst arrived in england one of thefirst things that dawned on me isactually howhard you work like off the pitch andalso just how physically fit you are howgood an athlete you are how likethe ability to just to just get up anddown the pitch and uncover a lot ofdistance sowhat i want to know is how important isthat part of the game to be able to playanddictate the play like you do howimportant is the hard work that you dooff it toallow you to do that i think i think inmodern football is really important youknowthe number 10 on the past was like thatplayer maybe don't run too muchjust having the ball creative somethingandthe more than number 10 needs to run andwork harder you know needs to press thenthere needs to besometimes that that one when you losethe ball the counter press needs to bethemain man to do the first movement toshow to the others tolike come we will press again we'llrecover the balland it's really important what we do uhto bephysically good to playof course premier league we know is oneof thethe the league's most difficult to playon intensityand everything and also because we havea lot of gamesyou have a lot of games to play so youneed to be ready and you need to beto work hard every day to be to be fitenough to playevery game all right let's go and getset up and bruno what i want to know ishow do you[Laughter]do it again so bruno talk to me aboutone of your strengths as a player andhow do you work on it to keepkeep improving it i think uhthe the one the things i i i'm better ori do betteris like the the last last pass or or theshooting on goalfor me for example playing between thelines is really important becauseuh one of the things i i i like to traini like to improve is like toto be quicker on your you know on yourmind you know that's really goodthat's this drill that we've got set uphere for you today and it's going to tryand encourage people to actually do thatlike just play between the linescoming forward to receive the ballreceiving it on the back foot and thengot to finish a goal at the end as wellso hopefully get home get themthis seasonso bruno we've got a drill that's goingto show people how to play a little bitlike yourselfplaying in between the lines working ontheir first touch they're passingand then obviously a finish at the endready to go let's go all right let's gomove left from behind the mannequinreceive and return the pass move rightand repeat drop off towards the rightmannequin and receive the pass whilst onthe moveshift the ball behind the mannequin andreturn the ballsprint to your left mannequin collectthe passset yourself and shoot repeat the drillimmediatelythis timethat's it peel off nicegood work that's it i'm finishedback in second round let's gopeel off good niceyou've got to find the space and makeyourself available to receive the passnever stop moving create angles comeclose or drop offit makes you harder to mask as the drillcomes to an endmake sure your movement is deceptivedecisive and your first touch takes youinto the position to shootnow we're going to finish with somethingspecial we're back with cristiano who'sgoing to talk to us about free kicksso cristiano let's talk free kicks easyin trainingyou get loads of attempts in the gameyou only get one so don't show uslet's go okay so the first part is thefree kick in the gameyou referee puts the ball down or youplace it downhow do you how do you calculate what'sgoing ondepends i watch the the goalkeeper tosee what hewhere it is and i try to put over theworld so how do you how do you transferwhat you're doingin practice to taking out there on thepitch becauselike i said in training well the the thetraining makes uhperfect yeah so do you have uh like aroutine in your mind on how you canclose yourselfit depends if it's long distance i i tryi give five steps back if it's close igive three stepsyeah yeah okay can you talk through asyou're doing yeah i did onetwo threea little bit in the side and now look tothe goaland try to score the goal okay and thenand then just just lastly thatmost important part i think thatconnection with the ball yes do youwhat part of your foot do you use to tryto put the ball on that side you have toto give like that to give acut in a bowl like banana we call it[Music]let's try okayjust like that not not too goodmaybe the goalkeeper will catch thisball yeahlet's try another one it's all aboutconfidencewhen you say it's all about confidencehow do you approach it ifyou know maybe in the first half you geta free kick it doesn't quite work outhow you wanted it toyou get another chance later on in thegame well you have to be relaxedall the time not be on panic you shouldbe confident and try your best likealwaysyeah it's obviously something you put alot of effort into on this channellet's try one moreso good three out of three ain't badall the drills you've seen here todayare simple all you

model name to the tigerMexico you might be thinking to yourselfwhy the hell would they call a shoe madein Japan for American consumers Mexicowell the change in name was motivated bythe upcoming 1968 Olympic Games whichwas being hosted in Mexico bill and Philthought the name to be more marketfriendly thankfully there wasdisagreements between BRS and on aSukkah tiger regarding the new name withthe Olympic Games fast approaching theydecided to settle on the name aztecinspired by mexican history and theAztec empire hold on just a minutethough they changed the name again turnsout but German sports company by thename of adidas had some beef with thename it appears that using the Aztecmoniker on a running shoe was too closeto the adidas Azteca gold tracksuitfinally Bill Bowerman and Phil Knightdecided to call the shoe the Cortezinspired by the Spanish conquistadorHernan Cortes who in the 1500s if he didthe Aztecs in the markthe Northland the shoe was received wellby serious athletes

"[Music]fell pretty good welcome home great tobe home but I couldn't help but bereally pleased to see the Dean wearing abusiness suit and Nike shoes you knowbut I think we can all be and we can allbe glad that basically I was not thefounder of jockey underwear well we'lltry and make that a permanent change inthe Elevens wardrobe now I felt we knowyou don't do too many public speakingevents and a question a lot of peoplehave asked is what does it take to getPhil Knight up on stage so I thoughtmaybe we should share the story of whatgot you here todaynow you probably remember that we firstcrossed paths a couple of months agojust over theremake a McDonald Hall you were enteringthe building when I very politelyinterrupted you introduce myself weexchanged a couple of pleasantries andthen you went on inside about your daynow what you're probably less aware ofPhil is that I decided to camp outsideMcDonald Hall for the next 40 minuteswatching every possible human exit tothe building so that I could find youand you know casually bump into you asecond time to pitch you this interviewit's creepy I know yeah that that's howit happened I'll be honest I was prettynervous when you did come at that secondtime it was fight or flight I verynearly walked the other way but therewas this voice in my head it just keptsaying we'll just do itbut really Phil we are so thrilled andexcited to have you back on campus and Ithink I speak for every student herewhen I say how grateful we are for thisincredible business school well thankyou but you know having stalked me forat least 40 minutes I feel that thereshould be some payback oh I know thatmost of you know that Will's mother magshas come all the way from Ireland to behere today and having come such a longway I think you should reveal somethingabout yourself that she doesn't know soI don't know what you're trying tosuggest I was a perfect child well didyou make your bed this morning I didn'teven sleep in my own bed this morningcuz I gave it to my mom that wasn't whatit sounded likeall right now Phil Phil we don't want tomake you feel old huh this is payback bythe way yeah this could go back andforth a long time that's rightbut it's been almost 60 years yep sinceyou were here in our shoes an incomingMBA class of 1962 what kind of personwas Phil Knight back at the GSB howwould you have described yourself yeah Iwill but I wanted to tell you firstabout coming back to campus after beinggone for a whilethat you go out 20 years or so and youhaven't been back for a while and youcome back and it's more about justsharing a moment with family and friendsit's for a moment you step back inhistory and remember when you had allthe worldwide laying out before you andyou decided the things that you weregoing to find important and it wasreally the start of you becoming what heultimately became when I come back forjust a moment I always hear the voice ofFrank Shallenberger Bob Davis Jimporterfieldand I know that sounds sort of corny toeducated group but I promise you thatover halfthe people in this room when they comeback here 20 years from now will havethose same feelings you know for me youknow it was well yeah that I was the guythat thought an extrovert was the personthat stared at other people's shoes thatthe the it was a time for me to kind ofgrow and and chase what I was reallygoing to become and so it was really abig transitional period for me in mylife and as I say to this day when Icome back I still get inspired andlifted up do you've any favoritememories from your days back at Stanfordoh that no it was just a turning pointin general for me that you know my if Iwas honest I'd say that my undergraduatecareer was really focused on track andit got to be when I got to be a graduatestudent that has really focused on whatit was I wanted to be and this was justthe right school at the right time withthe right inspirational professors andit really doesn't get any better thanthatmm-hmm so you do graduate the GSB in1962 yep it's the time when SiliconValley isn't even a phrase yet right andyou had what you call this crazy ideawhat was the crazy idea and where did itcome about well I took theentrepreneurship class from FrankShallenberger and basically the projecthe had a term project where youbasically either attached yourself to acompany in the area or for the purposeof the paper made up a company and andhow it would succeed and even in thosedays a lot of my classmates were writingabout electronics which was certainlybeyond me since when I turn on a lightbulb when I turn on the electric switchthe light bulb comes on it's magic forme but my old track coach was alwaysworking with shoes and that felt thatyou know a light lightweight and shoeswas something that was neglected by themajor manufacturers Adidas and Puma andindeed my senior year Otis Davis won thePacific Coast Conference championshipand a pair of homemade Bowerman shoeswhich were ounce elated lighter than theother shoes so I kind of put thosethings togetherand and said if you were starting a shoefactory would you stillin Germany and I said it's such alabor-intensive business it makes moresense to start it in Japan Japan beingthe country that took German camerasdidn't and dominated the camera marketsays could they do the same thing insports use now it's really the thesis ofthe paper which ultimately I got caughtup in and here we are now you got an Ain that paper right I did okay but thatmattered if he ridiculed the paper Idon't know where we do today well thiswas a time when entrepreneurship postGSB was not just a last travel path itwas probably a less celebrated path whatgave you the confidence to push aheadwell if I didn't know I was gonna haveto be an accountant and now that'sthat's a scary thought no it was no butit was a it was when I wrote the paperit it just stayed in my head and at thetime I think the the ratio was the 26out of 12 27 new companies failed so Iknew the odds weren't high but I reallybegan to feel if I could do this thatwould really be meaningful to me andsomething that I would really have a lotof passion for and about and so that'swhere it started and away we wentnow two years in many of your classmateshave gone dan more traditional careerpaths you're back in Oregon you'reliving in your old room in the familyhouse and you're selling shoes out ofthe trunk of your car did you ever havedates in those moments and what was itthat kept you going well obviously therewere a lot of doubts but that I enjoyedwhat I was doing and I really thoughtthat I was bringing a product to theworld that was better than the otherproduct and and so I believed and and ifyou read the book wasn't too long beforeI had a bunch of other people thatbelieved as well and we just through allthe ups and downs and there were plentyof downs that we never stopped believingandso a lot of people say why did you staywith it there were a lot of negativemoments and a lot of downturns and and Ilook back on those days the most fun Iever had in business it was it was thatevery day every Monday you went to workand you knew it mattered what you didincluding whether you're gonna meetpayroll on Friday but it was an excitingtime and that that Frank Shallenbergerhad done a wonderful job of preparing usfor you know being an entrepreneur BobDavis a marketing professor said ifyou're gonna be an entrepreneur he saidevery day is a crisis in every Fridaysat Jesus crisis it was kind of the wayit wasnow you also talk in your book Sherdogabout those early trips to Asia mm-hmmso you're 24 years old traveling aloneto Japan it's a culture you don't know alanguage you don't speak to try andbroker that first shoe import deal sothis was a time before Stanford's globalstudy trip Sergey mixes where did thatability to embrace hustle anduncertainty come from in you well by thetime I got there I believed and so thatI believed that it was a good idea Ibelieve that if we can I get acooperative Japanese factory that Icould make the idea of work and so yeahthat overcame you know when you'rebidding I'm an entrepreneurand introvert why you basically have toyou have to believe you have to overcomethe shyness to to take certain chancesand I was willing to do that and youknow there were a lot of ups and downsbut ultimate worked and you know I thinkat the end of the day you got to believeand and that's what I did have maybeabove everything else mm-hmm no as yousaid the team grew and you weren't alonein this endeavor and I think there's nostory of Nike with that of coursementioning Bill Bowerman your formertrack coach at Oregon later US Olympicstrack coach and of course yourco-founder what became Nike you'vedescribed yourself as a person who'salways needed heroeswhy was bill a hero to you and what isit you learn from him well he was a veryunique person that that he was probablythe best track and field coach in worldfor one thing but he was also at acertain command presence and a certainbelief in certain leadership things thatthe leaders did you know he he said I'mnot a I'm not a track coach he says I'ma professor of competitive response andhe he had a way of having sayings thatgot your attention and really focusedyou on attitude his strategy for runningthe mile was start out and run the firsttwo laps at a very fast pace run thethird lap as fast as you canon the fourth lap triple your speed andand they said that you know the OregonTrail he says the the Cour the thecowards never started in the week diedalong the way that leaves you and me andthat's once again him getting it kind ofkind of your attitude and is his bestone for me it was always do right andfear no man and so he had a biginfluence on my life certainly thebiggest influence other than my parentsand if you go back through this sayingsand who he was he was always working onattitude this is a man that had seencombat in World War twoyou know fired a gun and been fired atand he had seen competition that it'sits most extreme level and he thought hecould his job as a confessor professorof competitive response was to get kidsready for young men and young womenultimately to be ready for the thetoughest competition they can face soyou know he brought to me you know acertain attitude which you can be anintrovert and have attitude and so thatwas sort of me and he had a hugeinfluence on that and and he was a heroof mine in those days and to this daymm-hmm when you first met him youdescribed it as love and fear at firstsight right and then there was a littlehate that came after that he really kindof believed in hazythat and you had to prove that youwanted to be there and so he would makeyou go through hoops which I didsomewhat reluctantly now beyond bill ofcourse you talk with a lot of affectionabout that core early Nike team and Ithink you had a name for each otherright well yeah we did oh I see you'replaying that game now that the firstfour or five people in the company wewound up calling each other but faceswhich we don't do that anymore were moreprofessional group now you know our viewfrom the top team we've a similar namefor each other actually it's good it'shealthy but what was it about that earlyteam and that culture that made it sosuccessful well I think first of allthey were a bizarre group to say theleast each of them in his own way butthey were and I hope this showed in abook that they were able very ablepeople that really kind of didn't getalong with society in general so it waskind of a perfect fit and theycomplemented each other in terms oftheir abilities and then lastly all ofthem believed it was they they just whenwe would hit a down period nobodythought this is in okay okay we got toget together and find their way out ofthis one and so it was fun being afoxhole with those guys and andbasically it's corny but we loved eachother and we were going to go throughthis come hell or high water and it wasa very exciting intense time and it as Isay I love those times mm-hmm you foughta lot of crises togetheryeah for sure in recent years Phil we'veseen many high-profile disruptivecompanies being pressured to rein inwhat we're seeing is aggressive machowin at all costs cultures cultures thathave brought these companies so muchearly success in their life just lastyear Nike faced some similar accusationsand the management team made some prettydecisive changes when you grow from astart-up to a 74,000 person teamhow do you preserve the best of thatwinning culture in a more complexdiverse global workforce yeah well hetouched on a lot of things there that Imean I do think that Becky's culture isa big part of its reasons for successand the culture really was formed in theearly days by the way the four peopleplus me and it still exists to this dayI'd say a lot of people say well if Philhad a dominant influence on that and hedidn'tI mean I've often said many times Nikeis young and irreverent and I'm neitherthat but it did it did to use barman'sword addict they came within a certainattitude and and it was sort of usthat's who we were and the culture hasbeen modified some and which is a goodthing and but it's still kind ofbasically there and I think it's a bigpart of its strength that yeah so I Ihope that that culture is is basicallyin place you know twenty years from nowit and and it's one thing it fits withsort of our view then and now about whata brand is you know it doesn't matterhow many people hate your brand as longas enough people love it and as long asyou have that out you can't be afraid ofoffending people you can't try and godown in the middle of the road you haveto take a stand on something which isultimately I think why the Kapernick hadworked mm-hmm well that's let's jumpinto those athletes so I want to takeyou back to 1978 Phil you stumble acrossa shy timid retiring Stanford tennisplayer by the name of John McEnroe timidI wouldn't say[Laughter]well we got to see a little bit of Johnin that video but for anyone who doesn'tknow tennis John is a young fantastictennis player who's as well known forbreaking racquets as he is breakingserve he is everything that the tennisestablishment at the time the majormajority of the market was not so whatmade him the right ambassador for Nikewell the the the story basically we hadan agreement with Jimmy Mac JimmyConnors agent for him to were in highcase shoes and he did he warm that willMelton and the agent said as soon as hegets back from Wilmington we'll get itsigned well they won one Milton and soonhe got back from Europe boy he hadsummer matches and then came the US Openand he said as soon as we get done withthe US Open we'll get this contractsigned well they won the US Open andthen we got down to sign the contractsays I don't remember it this way thatwas Jimmy Connors agent not JimmyConnorsbut that was the end of our endorsementwith Jimmy Connors and so the next yearI think it was that well I went toWilmington you know looking for the nextgreat hope and there were a bunch ofreally good American young Americans 18and under I was looking at the 18 andunders and they had Brian Godfrey who isa great player in Elliot Telstra was agreat player and the head of USA tenniswas saying those are really greatendorsements stay away from that kidMcEnroe he's too much of a hothead he'splaying over on court 14 I went right toFort 14 and basically that week he wasplaying the number 16 player in theworld filled int and he's 18 years oldand hits his first serve in and thechalk flies up and the line judge goesout McEnroe jumps over the net puts hisnose this far from the official he saysare you sure that call are you very surethat call Wow and I turned to the guyswith his this kids not afraid and youknow I kind of became a fan of hisintensity and his competitiveness andhis attitude he did lose controlsometimes but that well I alwaysremember Frank Deford rightof Hindman and Sports Illustrated whenhe said a big picture of mechanist whyisn't this man smilingBeethoven didn't smile much eitherthat's faira few years later actually several yearslater you decided to name the executivebuilding at your headquarters in Oregonafter John McEnroe what is it you weretrying to say to the team at Nike indoing that well we named all thebuildings after our heroes at the timeand you know he was one of them and thatjust that was where my office was fairenough you're glad to see him backplaying well and I that makes me feelingbetter now let's fast-forward to 1984you come across another decentbasketball players name is MichaelMichael Jordan Jordan Michael Jordanthat's it now Nike were actuallycriticized at the time for overpayingfor Jordan's signature but of coursewith hindsight he became more than anathlete he became a two and a halfbillion dollar revenue brand for Nikebeyond MJ's greatness what was it thatmade that brand so successful and sodominant yeah it's it isn't somethingyou can bottle it's been you know trulyone of the unique experiences really inall of marketing that obviously he hadit all and and we pretty much knew thatcoming in I mean he was Player of theYear he was handsome he could jumpingand that he won the nationalchampionship with a winning shot yeah atall but and yeah when we signed him wesigned him for more than any rookie hadbeen paid before was signing for$250,000 a year and fortune magazine rana little insert another article saysthere's no greater indication that Nikehas lost its way than the fact that theypaid Michael Jordan $250,000 and butthat it's but we can't combined it withwhat we thought was a really good shoe areally distinctive shoe was red andblack it wasn't just white or black andof course he wore to great and greatperformances and then we had the addedbenefit of David Stern banned it in theNBA so he immediatelymind what became a good ad says bannedin the NBA and every kid in the worldone of that and that and it's it hasn'tbeen straight uphill it had a one yearwhere sales actually went down butoverall that was the what we gottogether was really good advertisingwhich reflected his personality whichwas strong and it's been an unbelievablesuccess that when he quit playing salesof Jordan Brand product over 750 milliondollars and this last fiscal year theytopped three billion dollars and longafter he quit planned so as I said tomany people imagine how much we'd sellif he'd never played we can only dreamPhil its Nikes 55th anniversary nextweek I believe yeah the company's atrecord revenue levels and just last yearNike was voted alongside Apple as thefavored brand of Millennials and I thinkthere's a few of us in here who mightattest to that how does a brand stay sorelevant to so many people for so longwell it's it's hard work but you have towork at it all the time but I think youknow our thing obviously it starts withthe product the the product is by farmost marketing our most importantmarketing tool and so we're constantlyworking to improve product and so thekind of the recent upturn is becausewe've had a really good product pipelineprobably the react running shoe isnumber one on the list but there's beena lot of others and that so that'sthat's been really important and thenyou know good advertising is critical toit that you know that the Wieden andKennedy experience has been is in manyways as dramatic as Nikes and it'sreally been kind of a long slide eachother when I first met Dan Wyden Iwalked into the door of his quote officehe had three people besides himselfsitting around a card table and he saidwelcome to widen Kennedy and I just wantyou to know one thing I hate advertisingand he looked at me says well this wouldbe interestingand it has been but it is interestingthat you know obviously if I would havesaid that Procter & Gamble I'd have beenon they take your 25 million take your$25 advertising budget and go on at thedoor but they were a small advertisingfirm and he grew to understand that whatI didn't mean was that I hatedadvertising what I meant was I hatetraditional advertising and he foundways to find out who Nike is or whoMichael Jordan was and project that tothe consumer and not only the Nike youknow succeed Wieden and Kennedy now hasoffices all over the world you know overa thousand employees it has coca-cola asa client as Honda's a client has a lotof the world's most famous brands itsclients they've been an enormous successand to this day they work really hard attrying to find out you know who it isand who the athlete is and how toproject them I know we had Boris Beckerthe great tennis players and we weretrying to get him as an endorsement andDan Wyden was making the pitch and hesays we will find out who you are andproject that to the world and Morrissays how in the world can you know who Iam when I don't know who I amand just said well we'll find outwell we didn't we didn't make the salehe didn't we didn't get this we didn'tsell him but but that is one of thethings they've done so the advertisingand the product are two of the two thereally important things and then keepingthe product for us and keeping theadvertising fresh and it's an ongoingchallenge and we don't always hit it youknow a couple years ago we took a littledip and it's a very very competitivebusiness and in every six months is kindof a new life and everybody has to beaware that mmm Phil this is a school anda speaker series dedicated to leadershipso we want to make sure we we touch onthat topic something the MBA one classis challenged with each year is whywould someone follow you I think therecan be a stereotype of what a CEO shouldbe sometimes we think of them as anatural extrovert around the valleysometimes they can be hero likecharacters you described yourself as shyintroverted someone who identifies withthe Bournehowever those that's why that's why weget on that but but how if those traitshelped you as you built Nike well Ithink you know I mean obviouslyintroverted introverted people have atendency to listen which I think goodleaders do but when I was in school thatyou know they talked about two differenttypes of leadership they talked aboutautocratic leadership and Democraticleadership and you know it was only 15years after World War two and you knowthey had two of the great autocraticleaders everyone Douglas MacArthur andGeorge Patton and they at the timelooked on as being very successful thatthen you have a democratic styleleadership which is you know the thingis getting people involved and talkingto people and that so I think for it'sprobably almost impossible for an introto be an autocratic leader but Internetcan be a Democratic leader and the ideaof democratic leadership progressed thisis the this started to talk use the termcollaborative leadership which is reallyin my view the ultimate and only kind ofleadership to this day that in this dayand age autocratic leader doesn't workit can work for temporarily but it won'twork long run and I hope that the peoplein this in this auditorium today don'tget the idea that hero leadership meansbeing autocratic and you know that Imean obviously I think Steve Jobs haslooked at is really kind of in this areaof one whole world really has been oneof the great leaders which I believe hewas but I do believe at the end of hiscareer he was beginning to modify hisyou know natural autocratic style whichif you will got him fired his first touraround Apple and as he got to go throughApple the second time there was a changein Steve Jobs and you notice that fromthe commencement speech he gave to toStanford University and and he hired TimCook and he had a lot of give-and-takewith Tim Cook and Tim Cook who I knowquite well is very much a collaborativeleader and and I believe a greatcollaborative leader so I think that youit justdon't equate hero leadership withautocratic leadership the only Thaistyle of leadership that will work inthis day and age is collaborativeleadership mm-hmm I fell another thingyou may know about this group is thatwe're pretty touchy-feely bunch thesedays of course in your book you describebusiness as war without bullets yeah soas you look back in those early days andI keep dealing with those criseswe're solve skills tools an entrepreneurlike you could really afford back thenwhat type of what type of skills aretalking about the softer skills thetouchy-feely well I think yeah I meanyeah I think that looks you dogobviously I don't come across as atouchy-feely type and neither were anyof those top five but there's lots ofdifferent ways of communicating and Ione of the things I don't like about thepolitically correct movement is that tome it politically correct has beenfounded by people that couldn'tcommunicate and they don't want you tocommunicate very well eitherbecause communications really is a kindof an individual thing everybody's alittle bit different it's like peoplehave different fingerprints they havedifferent personalities they havedifferent emotions and I think theleaders job is to know who his team isand there's different ways tocommunicate with that teamwe weren't touchy-feely in the sensethat we were always patting each otherback and say how we feel but you couldsay how you doing today son of adidn't mean the same thing and sothere's just different ways thedifferent ways to to do they like to dothat mm-hmm I think we need to bringthat into the chatter on campus thesedaysnow Phil we we also study a lot here hadleaders act in times of crisis Nike andyourself have dealt with several todaythe Nike brand is stronger than ever butof course in the late 90s Nike did forsome time become synonymous withsweatshops and slave wages as you lookback how do you feel you handle thatcrisis what would you do differently andwhat are you most proud ofwell the one of the things that that wedidn't talk about in Business Schoolwhen I was here was the media and so Ithink probably this group is probablymuch more aware of the media but it'sit's always there it's more prevalentthan it's ever been and they're notalways consumed by facts that and sowhen they when they first charges cameat Nike run sweatshops that you knowit's a it's a really seductive argumentto say this person only makes fourdollars a day and Michael Jordan makesyou know thirty million dollars a yearand Phil Knights worth two billiondollars and and isn't this awful and butour initial reaction was that we don'trun sweatshops and that you're wrong andI was the CEO at the time and that wasmy strategy and it was awful it didn'twork and so we kind of after about ayear that it became clear and so we tookanother tack which says yeah you can youcan criticize the ones but this is whatwe're going to be and this is how we'regoing to be a better company over thenext ten years and we're going to takethese steps each year and you come lookat any of our factories anywhere in theworld that you want and we've kind ofbeen on that path ever since and that'sbasically working and I do think youknow that we have had lots of goodcomments that don't get much publicityfrom the media and you know one of thegood ones was a memberthe United Nations says Nikes the goldstandard for all apparel companies andhow they run their run their factoriesand it's a constant battle oh becausewe're always kind of looking for newfactories or changing factories and wehave most of our shoe factories and ourgood apparel collectors have been withus for 20 or 25 years but economicschange at different times so you dochange some of them on the periphery soit's a constant battle to live up to thestandards we have but we have a wholeteam at Nike that does that all the timeand basically is talking to people onthe production line all the time and Ido think that our factories are the bestin the world right now for conditionsand and it's it's a basic truth thatgreat shoes are made by great factoriesyou don't want a you know you know a badfactory making your ear the best shoesin the world that feels something elsewe hear a lot from the media but alsooccasionally at Stanford is to find andfollow your passion and you are perhapsthe example of someone who built abusiness dedicated to something theylove which is sports and athletesthere's many of us in the room today whoI feel are struggling to maybe tie ourtrue passions to a viable business orcareer what would you say to people likeus well I think you know that one thingthat is left out is that you got to havea niche you got to have a reason tosucceed my reason that was that you knowJapan could make shoes economically andthat but then the rest of it you knowfit right and home base for me so and Ido think if you're gonna be anentrepreneur it has to be something thatyou really love because there will be alot of dark days and as I say we neverhesitated in those mark dark days so I Iwas fortunate enough to find what Ithought was a niche to go with mypassion and that's that's what you needto bring those two things together butwhen you do you're very very fortunateand take advantage of it mm-hmm allright well look Phil this has beenbrilliant thus far I know Nike say thereis no finish line we do need to finishin about 15 minutes Phil this has beenbrilliant we're almost gonna let you gonot quite yet there's a little traditionwe like to do up here on stage andcalled a lightning round so the idea isI'm gonna ask you a set of either/orquestions we want you to answer the oneanswer that comes first in your mindokay you didn't warn me about this youdidn't tell me you were gonna mention meI might get back to her all right lookbecause it's a new thing we're gonnastart

[Music]your wanteddip and dots inside the sole of yourshoe well nike's basically done thatwith thesebad boys so we're going to cut them opento see how they're built and we're goingto pull what's inside and count how manybeads there arein a pair of these shoes it's been alittle while since we've done a sneakeron the channel butspring's just around the corner so ithought we'd start doing some moreand i want to start doing kind of like asneaker head saturday or something or idon't know i don't even know what daythis video is going to come outbut i want to just take common sneakersand do a moreexploratory version of a cut in halfbecause the sneakers are a lot harder tojudgeyou know there's a lot more materialscience behind them so it's a lot harderjust tomake concrete opinions by cutting themin half without actuallyhaving the labs to test the materials sothe series will be more of likecut in half to show you guys what'sinside how many layers are how thick thelayers areso you can have the information to judgefor yourself if you wanta pair of whatever shoes we're reviewingand also for curiosity's sake becausethere's so much unique technology in thesneaker world compared to the boot worldlike these little dippin dots that areinside of here so the brand is nike themodel or the style is the joyride dualrunthe colorway i got is the black andlaser crimson they weigh 10 ouncesthey retail for 130 and they're made invietnam now let's go over the featuresof the shoe starting with the purpose sothis is arunning sneaker or shoe it's peoplestill wear them as regular shoes butthey're designedfor running and there's two versions ofthis these shoes there's the flyknitversions and the pair i got there's alot of reviews and there's some peoplethat already cut these in halfthe what's inside guys cut the flyknitversions in half and seth fowler alsohas a really good video on the flyknitversion so you can check those guys outso i want to do these ones just becausethey're just a little bit different theyonly i think they only have the twopockets of the beadsthat kind of leads us to the nextfeature which is the most prominentfeature of the sneaker which is thebeadsso this is kind of um it's reallystrange because i thought for sure thatthis was just kind of a little gimmickything where there's gonna be a reallythin layerbut as soon as you put these on you canfeel it there it's pretty fullof these beads and the the whole ideabehind these beads isthat it kind of gives you a custom fitevery time you take a step or every timeyouyou run because those beads displaceaccording to how your weightis distributed on the shoe and maybe themost interesting thing about thatis that you would assume that these arekind of like an air pocket like you seein the air jordans or the air force oneswhereit's sealed but every time you step downyou'reyou're pressing the air out of thesechambers and it comes up through theinsole and allows it to have a littlebit more squishwhich i thought was really interestingthey've had a little bit of issue withthe the waterproofnessof these shoes for that reason becauseif you get your shoe wetthat water can leak into here and kindof create a little swampybead zone on the inside the next featurewould be these highfriction pads here they put these hereand at the toes toprevent early wearing through thislittle chamber because i don't thinkthisthis chamber is very thick and i doubtit's a really wear resistantcompound because it's so squishy soanother kind of weird design thing isyou assume that if it's going to be arunning shoe you'd want these to bepretty durableand these these friction pads are notvery thick and i feel like you'd wearthrough this pretty quick other than thebead midsole it looks like it's got kindof a eva foam it's a really soft foammidsolethe upper is just a knit upper itdoesn't really say on their site whatit's made from i'm assuming it's somesort of polyesterknit fabric pretty simple lightweightshoethat uses a pretty pretty awesomegimmickfor being honest i really like the ideaof having these little beadsin the inside so the question i'm tryingto answer by cutting these in half isfirsthow many beads are in this thing we'regoing to count them allhow easy is it is it cut through thisthe see-through plastic or rubber on theside hereand how thick are these chamber wallsbecause you know just it's they're sosquishy i assume it would be pretty easyto like step on a really sharp rock oractually step on a piece of metal andthen your shoes arereally ruined so now let's cut them inhalf and try to answer those questionssee how these are built and see what'sinside of them and how manylittle beads there are after we talkabout the sponsor rage shadow legends isthe sponsor this video and if you'relike me you need a gameevery once in a while while you'resitting on the bus umwaiting for videos to upload or unwindat the end of the day and raid shadowlegends is a really good game for thatbecause it's nottoo simple to where you get sick of itafter a few minutesbut it's not so complicated that it'snot easy to get into and it's one ofthose games thatas you play it more

good-looking elvesthey're easy to playand they're super powerful but it's notalways clear which side they're on ifthey're good or they're bad and it kindofit's fun to build them because of thatreason

theybounce a lot more than you'd expect whenyou try to roll them around theyjust kind of jump all over the place butlet's see what's inside[Music][Music]these shoes are so weird i shoessneakers are they're really fun to dobecause the technology isis always progressing so much fasterthan boots and they're always so strangeand unique so the first thing i noticedwas howsoft this foam is i think this is an evafoam and it's probably the softest foami've ever felt in any shoeand it's super thick it's about an inchat the ball of the foot which is waymore than what i thoughtand what it feels like and there's theselittle structural columnsthat connect the foam midsole to theoutsole with these little like thelittle friction pads hereand i think that's to help it from beingtoo sloppy when you'rewhen you're stepping and then running itmight give it a little bit of structureto help itnot be too soft the transparent part ofthe outsole is only three millimetersthick which is thicker than i thoughtbut still prettythin if you're going to be running inthese for 100 miles or several hundredmiles i would expect these to notlast as long as i would want to get outof 130 pairs of shoesthe construction of these is acombination of a strobel stitchand cemented construction you seethere's this little stroble stitch onthe inside and it's glued to the midsolebut thethe beads are kind of the the thing thatmakes this shoe what it is but it's alsothe strangest thing because they theyreally arean odd texture they like they squishlike regular foambut they bounce like a bouncy ball whichis really odd because you know bouncyballs are such a hard density and mostthings that have a lot of rebound likethatthey aren't as light as this so it iskind of an interesting material and it'smade out of a tpewhich is a combination of rubber andplastic and then this particular tpe isinfused with air which gives its squishand its lightnessand i wish you guys could fill these iwish everyone could justget some of these and feel how odd theyare because they really behavein a really strange way especially whenyou're trying to gather them up off thetable that you spilleverywhere and these beads are whatnike claims gives these shoes a 14more shock absorption than most runningshoesso it's kind of an interesting thingit's super gimmickybut i don't know it's fun you know whodoesn't wanttheir shoes to look like they havedippin dots on the inside i'm kind of asucker forgimmicks yeah they're really really oddshoes andi guess now it's time to gather up allof these beadsand count them up off the floor and offthe table in the cupand see how many there actually are inthis shoeso overall a really fun shoe a reallyunique shoeand i like these a lot um like i saidi'm a sucker for gimmicks especially ifthey look likedippin dots and they're reallycomfortable they're not gonna lastnearly as long as most shoes but they'rethey're made for running andi don't know i feel like running shoesdon't have as long of a lifetimeso let me know what you guys think letme know what you think of these shoeslet me know what you think of these likei probably call it sneakerhead saturdayor sneaker saturdayand let me know what else you want me tocover in these videos umthere was no leather in the shoe sothere wasn't a whole lot for me to sayleather-wisebut uh this was fun i like i like doingthese videos thereis a little more casual a little morefun a little a little bit ofa little more exploratory so thank youguys for everything you doand um if you haven't watched theinstructable boot video go watch itbecause that videotook us so long and it was so much funandum it's a good video so thank you guyssee ya[Music]you,26,UCId9g4zlQ9BOn6fLKIt1Y0A,Rose Anvil,460,56,0,2386,"['nike

this video is sponsored by Nike you everhear the commercial be like Mike theyweren't talking about dr. Mike they'retalking about this guy oh my god guys Ican't believe I'm actually saying thisI'm officially teamed up with Nike whatam I going to be doing with Nike runningthe LA Half Marathon 13.1 miles comeApril 5th I've never ran a half marathonbefore it's my very first I'm reallynervous because I'm not really anendurance runner I'm more like ahigh-intensity interval type guy this isgonna be tough I'm really excited for itbecause a it's a challenge B it'sstepping outside my comfort zone and oneof the main reasons I'm excited about itis because Nike also wants me to testtheir new shoe called to react infinitythis is the woman shoe this is the men'sshoe actually prefer this one probably alittle bit better I'm a man that likeswearing pinkI guess not a big deal but first I wantto talk to you about my trip to the Nikeworld headquarters[Music]no I got these Nike reacting for theseshoes they're fired they're gonna helpyou build dams you have no idea thatkind of dams you could build if you getthese shoes I got you the coolest thingright off the bat and visiting NikeWorld Headquarters is the feeling thatyou're surrounded by greatness they havebuildings dedicated to the greatestathletes in the world I think myfavorite building that I visited therewas the Michael Jordan building growingup Michael Jordan was one of my biggestheroes and seeing their collection ondisplay of every single Jordan shoe thathas been released to date was in st. myfavorite Jordan shoe was the 17 I knowit's kind of a peculiar one most peoplewould say is 17 but that was the firstshoe I was able to afford when I came tothe US now I never read the book shoedogs by Phil Knight but that essentiallytells the story of how Nike started andduring this tour they showed us theintimate story of how Nike began as BlueRibbon sports how that first Nike logowas developed and sold for somethinglike $25 they showed us the first shoesthat were created by Nike moving on wewere able to check out the differentsport facilities they had there in factthey let me get a few jump shots in onthe basketball courts I was drainingthrees well maybe like at a 30 percentcompletion rate on the same core whereLBJ and MJ practice at some pointobviously also got to check out theirtrack there was actually some Olympicathletes training on it I'm not gonnadisclose anything but that was Ober cooland then I was able to take to the trackit was a little wet it was a littleslippery but I was in the zoneI was hitting my stride and I realizedI'm not in that great shape and I becameout of breath and I realized I'm gonnahave to train really hard for this halfmarathon let's talk about the reactantfiniti run shoe Nike wanted to create ashoe that would reduce running injuriesover the last thirty years we have notseen a reduction in running injuriesdespite the fact that we're putting allthese new technologies into our shoesI'm gonna be giving you my honestfeedback as to how it feels on my footbut let's talk about the research andhow they got tothe shoe to be running related injuryreduction shoe over this last 30 yearsmost of the blame for running relatedinjuries came from individuals whooverpronate meaning that when they runtheir foot inverts a little bit justlike this you'll often times see in theedge of the sneaker on the medial sideor the middle side start to wear fasterthan the outer side that could be a signof over pronating and because of that abunch of shoes hit the market that werelabeled stability shoes or motioncontrol shoes those shoes had maybeextra dense foam here or medial postinghere which is like a thickened materialin order to help stabilize your foot foreach time your foot strikes the groundthe creators of this shoe told us thatthey wanted to flip this whole theory onits head we put lots of prototypes onlots of different athletes and when wehave them running we listen to what theysay we measure all sorts of stuff whilewe're what we have then we're evaluatingthem but we're also always talking tothem to listen to what they say and whenyou do that with this prototype thatprototype the different prototype thething that they always keep coming backto the tells us feels good is pushingcushioning a rocker style bottom so theshoe translates its motion well andkeeping that flying at upper so it'sreally thin and breathable and light butalso a really lock down heel so you havedecent stability in the back end hereand they tested it it was a randomizedcontrolled study of about 200participants male and female they brokethem up randomly into two groups halfthe groups ran in this shoethe other half ran in the Nike structure22 shoe which is a motion control shoewhat do they find those who ran in thereact infinity shoe here had a fifty-twopercent less likelihood of developing aninjury how do they classify theserunning related injuries well if therunners experienced pain due to runningand it caused them to miss three or moreruns that considered a running relatedinjury you know me when it comes topeople doing medical research I'm askeptic first especially if it's somekind of revolutionary new study it'svery rare that one study comes along andchanges the way we've been doing thingsbecause the way you normally do it isyou have a hypothesis generating studythan a pilot study and then you startedadapting and figuring out how to chainwhat you're doing in this case they hada hypothesis let's do away with motioncontrol and focus more on cushioninghere they did this first study and itwas a small study they admit that theyadmit that they there's a lot that theydon't knowin fact when j war vets was giving ushis speech at the nike worldheadquarters i was really impressedbecause of how many similarities therewere between the research he was doingin the nike lab - how I treat mypatients first of all he was not afraidto say I don't know the challenge isthat that they're just there reallyisn't a lot of information that's reallyreally well-known like for example likeexactly how many runners are gettinginjured each year we don't know what arethe the mechanisms of these injuries wereally don't know this is a scenariowhere the answers aren't there we haveto figure this out and we want you guysto come on a journey with us so we cansolve thisI appreciate that level of humilitysecond instead of just looking atobjective measures they also askathletes what worked for them when therearen't these well known scientific youknow this knowledge where we alwaysstart is with the voice of our athleteswe work with our athletes we you knowput lots of different shoes on them lotsof different prototypes and we'reconstantly talking to them sure we're inthe lab with our metrics and we'reanalyzing everything their kinematicstheir kinetics yeah but we're alsolistening to their voice and saying youknow what feels good what feels goodwhat feels good what feels good and wentover and over and over again the answeris the same cushioning when you give mecushioning and you do it right that'swhat feels good my body feels good wellthat's what we're starting from when Isee my patients yes I look at theirvital signs yes I look at their labvalues but I also talk to the humansitting in front of me there's a lot ofvalue in that and I'm glad that Nikesseeing that talking to their athletesgives them value when I say athletes Idon't just mean their top tier athleteslike LeBron James I'm talking aboutweekend warriors I'm talking about youat home who wears Nike sneakers to gofor a run once a month you're an athletetoo and they're listening to you

hi and welcome to the running channeli'm andy and today together with annawe're going to be taking a look at thebest running shoes out there right nownow we've been running in all of theseshoes to test them out and we don't getpaid by the brands to say nice thingsabout themso what you're about to see are ourgenuine opinions to help you out we'vesplit those shoes into differentcategoriesstarting with brand new launches thenupdates to existing modelsfollowed by support shoes fast used forrace day and then finallyshoes that stood the test of time thatwe think are still worth a lookbefore we dive straight in though if youhaven't already please do hit subscribeit would really help us out and tap thebell icon if you want to be notifiedwhen we upload new videos all aboutrunning which we doevery week now let's jump infirst up we're going to take a look atwhat we think are the best brand newshoes that been releasedrecently so these are completely newmodels that didn't exist previouslythe under armour flow velocity wind is ashoe that under armour describeas simply fast and we'd have to agreethisis a shoe if you are looking at pickingup the speedit's a neutral shoe which looks quiteplain from its outsole but there's a lotof technology behind thisfirstly the shoe is bluetooth enabledwhich is similar to a lot ofunder armour's more recent updates so ithasbluetooth within the sole that connectsto the under armourmap my run app which means that whenyou're out on the run it gives youlive feedback on running metrics likeyour cadenceanother interesting feature of this shoeis the lack of rubberizedoutsole which adds to how lightweight itisand also the fast element of the shoedespite the lack of rubberized outsoleit does grip really wellto the road so there's no problems ifyou're trying to pick up a bit of speedand the ground is wet underneath you hadno problems going around corners inthese shoesone thing i would say is that it isdefinitely less bouncy and gives youless of anenergy return than some of the othershoes on testand that is mostly down to the strippedbackversion of the outsole and so if you'reused to having a more bouncy energyreturnthen this shoe does feel a little bitstiff compared to some of the othersnext is a shoe that could actually havebeen a considerationin our best support shoe category andthatis the nike invincible run this shoe hasa wider forefoot whichis great for my wider feet so reallynice fit straight out of the boxon this one it also has a higher zoom xfoam in it giving it a realsoft and cushioned feel to it it's areally responsive shoe and gives a lotofenergy return so compared to the likesof the under armour shoe you can reallyfeel the bounciness of this oneand another bonus is the flyknit uppermakes itsuper breathable the zoomx invinciblerun flyknit is a good shoe to considerif you're looking for anall-rounder something that you want totake out on some faster runsand some longer runs because of thecushioningand the supports and the overall energyreturnthat this shoe gives you puma made awelcome return to the running space in2021 withfive brand new shoes you might have seenus mention them in our monthly showsthis is the deviate nitro which pumadescribesas a performance shoe and it issuper light so it has nitrogen infusedfoam in it meaningit's a really cushioned ride gives you alot of energy returnon any kind of run long runs they'resuper comfortable foras you'd expect from a new launch thereis also a lot of tech in this shoe aswell it has got a carbon fiber plateso puma have joined the carbon fibergangwith the dv8 nitro so it gives you areal propulsionforwards but without feeling too stiffat the same timeit also feels a lot more supportive thansome of the shoes that have carbon fiberplates in themsome of them because they have such ahigh stack height canfeel like you're going to topple over alittle bit with how much they push youforwardwhereas the dv8 nitro just feels like alittle bitless aggressive than some of them imentioned themid foam is infused with nitrogen andthat's actually something that brookshyperionalso use in theirs so it's a technologythat has been around alreadyand puma have taken advantage of that soagain thisis really an all-round issue if you'relooking for something that's going to bea little bit fast maybe you're going fora 5k pbor you want something that's going togive you a little bit of umphon those longer runs tempo runs thatkind of thingthen the dv8 nitro is a good oneto check outnext up we're moving on to the best newupdate category so that's where wecelebrate the best new updates topre-existing shoe models or rangesnow we also know from some of our morelight-hearted videos that this is one ofthe things that's most scary to a lot ofrunners whohave found a particular pair of shoesthat they love and don't want to see itchanged at allbut in some cases it can be the casewhere you take a great shoe and make theright update and it can make it evenbetterso we're celebrating some of those bestupdates here nike have kept themidsole and outsole the same as thefirst version of this shoe so if you didhavethe first version then it's a verysimilar ride really toprevious versions apart from as i saythat plushcollar and tongue giving you a nice snugfitagain with my wider foot the forefoot onthisshoe does fit my wide feet quite nicelyand was really good out of the boxanother great all-rounder shoefor any kind of run the new balance 1080has always been a firm favorite from aneutral cushioning perspectiveand they recently released the 11thiteration of this shoe it's hard to sayfor sure but i would say personally thati found thesevery very slightly firmer than the tenthversion of the shoe but it's still anincredibly plushcomfortable cushioned shoe with thefresh foam technologythe outsole is very similar to theprevious version and gives good gripin different conditions on the roadthere's good coverage and i'd expectthis to wearpretty well for various levels of highermileage what's been referred to as theultra heel design at the back here hasbeen kept over from the 10th versionand i know that personally that gives areally nice fit it feels snug there's noslippage at the heel which you can getwith some shoesand i know from other runners who i'vespoken to who run thisthat's a feature that they really likeand that they're glad has been carriedover the upper is a really comfortableforgivingknitted material with what i wouldconsider to be just about the rightamount of extra protection around thesides and front of the toe areato help with movement laterally and alsothose people who are prone to kind ofbursting through their uppersover the course of time as they wear outso i shouldn't expect to see thatproblem here and there's a nice degreeof supportand comfortable close fit provided bythe upper ultimately this is a verycomfortablecushioned shoe so if you're looking forsomething to get your long runs donein comfort and that's your priority thenthis is definitely a shoe that youshould considerhoka oneone's mac 4 is a pretty newlaunch you might have seenus mention it in our recent monthly showand it takes an awful lot of inspirationfrom the likes of thecarbon x carbon x2 and hoka'srocket i would say that it's a lot moresimilar with the carbon x2 with its heelpull taband also the shape of the heel now thelaces on these ones are pretty longso double knots are needed but doesn'taffectthe shoe in any way cushioning is a bigplus point for this shoe soacross longer mileage it still feelssuper comfortablea lot of the faster shoes don't quitehavethat cushioning down because they aretrying to save weightbut with the mach 4 it definitely feelsmore cushioned and comfortable out onroadsall in all a dramatic update to themac series here and if you're lookingfor something that's going to feelcomfortable for miles and milesthen you can't really go too wrong withhoka's mach 4.these are the brooks levitate 4 and alot of shoe companies focus on weightreduction as the progression for theirshoes and brooks are no different withthe levitate 4.that's been what they've concentrated onand they say that with the new evolutionof their dna amp midsolethey've made this 20 lighter there'sbeen an update to the outsole as wellwhich i really like it's got what iconsider more or less full coverage sono messing about therebrooks say that's to speed uptransitions but ultimately on a run ijust found it gave a really nicesmooth foot strike and ride in generalas i was runningin addition to that that level of fullcoverage it did feel like a reallysticky outsole so ihad no issues with grip and i was reallyconfident even on wet days on prettysmooth tarmacthe upper has been updated too and it'llbe no surprise to a lot of people thatlike many manufacturers brooks are usingessentially a knitted material herethey say it's improved breathability andi'd have to agree they're reallycomfortable on a runthere's a nice degree of flexibilitywithout it feeling too stretchy likeyour foot sliding aroundand again with a degree of extra addedprotection around the sides here to stopthat kind of lateral movement that'ssometimesin early versions of these knitteduppers you would have experiencedi mentioned that they concentrated onreducing the weight but actually to holdthe shoe it feels quite heavybut as soon as you put it on that's nothow it feels at all and in this update ifelt that it was really springy it wasreally comfortableand it gave a really nice energy returnon my run i like the understated stylingand the simplicity of every element ofthis shoe so if you're looking forsomething that's comfortablebouncy gives you a nice level of energyreturn for an everyday trainer that canhandle your mileageup to your longest runs then the brookslevitate 4 is definitely worth a lookthe ultra boost has been a favorite shoefor many a runner for a very long timebut the ultra boost 21 has had some bigchanges made to it so first off theupperis made with what adidas called primeblue so that is recycled materialsplasticsthat are rescued from our oceans sopreviously adidaswould release special prime blue polyoceanplastic versions of their shoes in aseparaterange but it's really great to see thatthis is nowcoming through in their mainstreamlaunches so the shoe itself and itsupdates wellit's got a big chunky heel on it thistime and so that gives you a lot morebounceon the run and let me tell you these arevery bouncyso because of the addition to this itdoes mean that these ones areslightly heavier but i wouldn't say thatit'sas noticeable as some people in otherreviews maybe have saidi think unless you were wearing one ofthese shoes and one of the older shoesas a direct comparisonyou wouldn't really notice thedifference that much now price isobviously something to consider whenwe're going through all of these shoesand these don't come cheap but if you'relooking for an all-rounder pair of shoesthat you couldliterally wear for any run and you onlywanted one pairthen the adidas ultra boost 21 you can'tgo too wrongnext up we're going to be taking a lookat the best support shoes on the marketright nowsomething that we get a lot of requestsfrom you guys for which is why we'reincluding itif we're talking about support shoesreferring to those that help with overpronationnow if you don't know whetheroverpronate the best idea is to head toa specialist running store who should beable to help youbut ultimately what we're talking aboutis shoes that try to minimize therolling in movement at the ankle orpotentially the kneethat happens depending on the way yourfoot makes contact with the groundas you roll through these are the mizunowave inspire 17.now the 17 would indicate these havebeen around for a while and there are alot of die hard mizuno fans who swear bythese as their go-to support shoesultimately what's happened here is thatmizuno started to introduce their energyfoam which is a brand new variant oftheirmidsole foam across their whole rangeand it's made a game changing differentfor them as a brand where potentiallythey might have been getting a littlebit left behind mizuno's classic wavewhich is the plastic wave that you cansee running visibly through the midsolein combination with that brand new foamgive a really nice combination ofcushioning and supportso whilst they're not the most flashyshoes out there and you're unlikely tolook at them and thinkwow when you put them on they're areally pleasant niceconsistent solid performer and somethingthat you should consider if that's thesort of thing that you're looking forthey fit true to size and there's areally nice combination of fit providedby both the upper and the lacing systemso they felt securewith no heel slippage or anything toworry about thereultimately the combination of weightsupportcushioning it's not something to shoutabout they do a really solid joband if you're familiar with mizunoalready then i think these will be awelcome upgradeswiss brand on are known for buildingpretty comfortable shoeswith their strap line running on cloudsandthe cloud tech within the sole certainlyfeels like you are running on cloudswiththe cloud flyers so this is thebrand new shoe from on and the cloudflyer issuper supportive so it has helium foambuilt inas well as the cloudtech technology togive extra supportthis particular model includes some ofthe largestcloud technology and also has a muchmore plushtongue and collar around the heel toreallylock in your ankle and feel like you'vegot a supportive shoe onthis shoe is pretty lightweightconsidering that it's built to be asupport shoe and soit doesn't feel particularly heavy whenyou are runningin these ones at 280 grams that'sactuallynot bad for a support shoe all in allthe cloud flyer is a greatshout if you are new to the on brand andwants tohave a cushioned and supportive yetstill prettylightweight shoe to run in these are thebrook's adrenaline gts21 and they're oneof my favorite support shoes becausethey feel like they're supportiveby stealth that's both through beinglightweight they feel immediatelylightweight out of the box but moreimportantly when you're out on a runas well which is quite a pleasantsurprise compared to a lot of stabilityshoes that are out thereand it's also because of the way thatthey provide that stability which is viabrook's guide rail system which feelsparticularly unobtrusive from a supportperspectiveessentially it's two pieces of firmer orhigher density foam either side of theheel to providea more guided transition through footcontact they do have a 12 millimeterdrop which is worth bearing in mindbecause that is right at the top endof the drop that you might expect fromany running shoes out there at themomentand if you're looking for a low dropshoe this definitely isn't it but ifyou're looking for a support shoe thatactually feels really responsive andlightweightand could be a good all-round optionthen this is definitely worthconsideringnext up we're looking at shoes to helpyou run fast whether that's intervaltraining time trials orflat out racing it's an increasinglycompetitive and confusing category withnew technology like foamsand carbon plates but we've done ourbest to wade through those and bring youthe very best shoesfor running fast the saucony endorphinpro is a high performance shoe thatwe've seen on the feet ofmany notable runners and as far as wecan tell every time new stock has comein on thesethey have instantly sold out so if youare looking to get a pair of these goodluck because they are a bit like golddustthe aim of the saucony endorphin pro isto help you smash your pbsand in order to do that it has speedroll technologyit's got a carbon fiber plate and ithas what sockeny call power runcushioningmaking it lightweight and very bouncylet's be honest they lookpretty nice too they are very verythin on the ground when it comes tocushioning because this is a lightweightracing shoe so you don't have that plushtongue um but the fit of them isreally really snug in a good way so itfeelsreally responsive on the run and superduper light all in all this is a reallywell constructed speedy shoe perfectif you want to get a little bit of extraspeed going especially on those temporunsso hoka's out and out racer is therocket x but we've actually gone for thecarbon x2 for this section of speedy issuesfor releases in the last year and thatis because we absolutely love running inthe carbon x2it has a rubberized eva outsole on itand because of this we have seen somereports that it's not quite as durableas some of the other speedy shoes ontests now i haven'tdone enough miles in it to be able totell you exactly how longthese last for but what i would say isthat i didn't have any problem with anygrip or traction becauseof the outsole so it's a carbon fiberplatedshoe with a meta rocker which is prettyaggressivebecause of this it really propels yourfootforward even walking in these you canfeel that you just want to gofit wise what i would say is that thecarbon x2 is areally good fit on me despite my widerfoot so you might seeon some of our other shoe reviews that ihave to take out some of the lacingand some of the eyelets just to givemyself a little bit of extra room andthat is most certainly the casewith other hoka models with the carbonx2 thoughit fits me very very nicely straight outof the box that's able to go and run initso a good speedy shoe just beaware of the outsole and some of theissues that people have had withdurabilitythese are salomon road shoes yeahsalomonare into the road shoes market nowthey're more known for their trail stuffbut theseare the eslab phantasm or fantasmiand these are what were worn by killianjourney when he tried to break the24-hourtrack record so again another shoe thathas been builtfor doing a long fast running theyare incredibly light i mean there isbasically nothing to them you can seeprobably when i put my hand through themthat you can seethrough the upper here there isliterallynothing to them which is why they're solight so this shoehas minimal padding minimal cushioningand is designed to besuper duper fast it's extremelybreathableas you can see from having my fingersthroughthe mesh that it has this mesh upper toit which does mean that it is superbreathablebut like i say there is nothing surplusonthis shoe just be aware that if you arecoming into the world of runningand you're not used to the faster typesof shoes that theseare not your average shoe that you wouldtake out for a sundaylong run i do love how fast and howtechnical these shoes are they're easyto maneuver in and have excellentground to foot contact now we couldn'tdo a roundup of the best racing shoeswithoutnike's vaporfly next percent these havechanged the gamefor running all around the world settingworld records and personal bestsand you'll be hard pushed not to find apair of these on a start line of anyraceanywhere with revolutionary new foam incombination with a carbon platethey're helping people to run fasterthan they ever have done beforeand now there's a new version the nikevapor fly next percent 2 which kate fromthe running channel has taken adedicated first look at so if you wantto find out more all about thatcheck out the dedicated video so thoseare just a selection of some of thetop fast shoe picks from us buthonorable mentionsdo need to go to the new balance fuelcell elite and the adidasadios adizero pro now we did do anentirevideo roundup on these faster shoes soif you want more in depth on thiscategory be sure to check out that videonow we move on to the shoes that wethink have stood the testof time these are shoes that we have runin andloved and run in some more so when youwear your pairs of shoes out you oftenwant to look for something totally newto give it a go but these are the pairsof shoes that you'll want to be buyingtime and time again nike's pegasus rangehas been around for a long timealmost as long as me embarrassingly sothis is nike pegasus 37.it's bouncy straight out of the box ituses nike's iconic react foam so you dogetan immediately responsive springy bouncyi've used that word twice alreadybecause that is how they feelstraight out of the box on your runsthere's really good coverage on theoutsole and actually the outsolehas good depth to it as well so there'sreally good grip no concerns therepretty good grip in all conditions thatin combination with the asymmetrictongue the lacing system and the uppergives a really snug fit that keeps younice and secure and helps add to thefact that feeling thatin combination with the springy midsoleyou feel like you could wear these shoesfor any kind of runlonger slow runs where you feel likethey're nice and forgiving and cushionedas well as fast runs where you want theshoe to be responsive and this isso again another success in theiterations of the pegasus for nikethe asics nova blasts are a fast shoetypically wornon the road so i've had to dig theseones out andprobably should have given them a bit ofa clean but you can tell that actuallythey don't do too bad on muddy trailseitherso the fit of these shoes especially formy wide feetis super comfortable it's got a slightlycushionedtongue which makes it a really nicecomfortable fitbut still feels pretty light to run inas well sogood for all round long runs and stuffthat's a little bit fasteras well so we did actually include thesein our bestshoes roundup video last year too andit's made a welcome returnto our shoes that we think have stoodthe test of timeso the ortholite insole is made fromrecycled materials and that combinedwith the flightfoam in the outsole makes it a reallybouncy and cushioned shoeit's one that i've enjoyed running intime and time againthis is the brooks ghost 13 and like itspredecessors it uses a midsole foamcalled dna loftbrooks say that this is the shoe withits softest cushioning in its rangeand i'd have to agree they're reallycomfortable straight out of the box theyfeel softand they feel like they'll absorbanything that you throw at them reallyone of the best things about the ghost13 is they haven't messed with it toomuch over the years and in fact if youtake a look at the laces that the tonguethat combination actually feels like itbelongs to a much older shoebut if you haven't ever had any problemswith the way that the shoes lace up andfit you in the last five or ten yearsthen actually that's going to be morefamiliar and you might like it the upperitself has been updated it feels reallynice and breathable and in combinationwith the lacing and tonguedoes give a really nice fit so if youwant a shoe that you feel like you canhead out for really long runs andthey're going to soak up the punishmentof hitting the roadsthen the brooks ghost 13 is a reallygood option andons cloud flow another one that i've dugout of my cupboard for this review whichi've really enjoyed running in andactually i was saying about the asicsnova blast and how they actuallyweren't too bad on muddy trails theseones if you have got a combinationof running on the road and then somesort of slightly more technical stuff iwouldn't say they're really muddy trailsbut these do perform really really wellas a bit of a hybrid shoe so it's gottheusual on cloud tech so there are 18different helium cloud techclouds along the bottom which do giveyouincredible grip the upper is breathableit's a really stylish looking shoe andis superduper comfy again no problems when itcomes to fiton my wide foot for the on cloud flowit's got a really niceplush feel around the heel which reallykeeps it in placebut then it's got a bit of a minimalisttongue on it as well so it does feellike a pretty light shoe although it'svery robustin its outsole so although thecushioning in the midsoleis moderate this is a shoe that you canreally go the distance inor pick up the pace for something alittle bit speedier as wellthat was a pretty comprehensive list butwhich ones would i choose if i had toput my money where my mouth iswell ultimately if i wanted one pair ofshoes that i could wear for all of thedifferent types of runs that i'd want tobe doingi'd be choosing between the brookslevitate 4 which i really likeand the pegasus 37 probably the pegasusthat edges it slightly for mejust in terms of how responsive andspringy they feel straight out of theboxand alongside those the nike vaporflynext percent still has it for me eventhough the endorphin prodoes push it pretty close from sauconyfor me thisis such a tough call to make becausethere are so many different categorieswithin this videothat i could pick one from each of themand stillnot be satisfied but if i only had torun in one pair of shoesfor the rest of my life from the shoesincluded in this videoit's going to be the asicsnova blast i just love that you can dofaster stuff in this you can do longerstuff in this and it really does feellike something that i'd be happyrunning in for the rest of my life sothere you go our top picks for the bestshoes out thereso what do you think do you have a pairof shoes that you swear by or do any ofthe shoes that we've mentionedtake your fancy

welcome back down to football I'manother review for you guys todayit's HB was gonna be on the Nike ProCombat Hyperwarm hydro pull hood you cansee what the product looks like I'mgoing to take a look at today I'm goingto go over some of the things of justwhat you would use this product for somethings I like about it how you can wearit to different colors and the price sowithout further ado let's take a littlequick look at the unboxing first well Igot this product is because you guysknow that I went to play in France andit was going to be extremely coldthere's about 40 degrees even down tothe 20s I believe so I needed a productthat was going to keep my head warm sowith that being said let's take a lookat the Box just the package that itcomes in take a look at the back of thebox you can see that there's for wearoptions you can wear it as a full Gatoryou can wear with your mouth open ormouth and covered you can wear it withthe top of your head uncovered or youcan use it as a neck warmer obviouslyI'm using this for football but you canuse a variety of sports includingsnowboarding skiing anything in thewinter and any time that you want tokeep your head warm or your head andneck warm let's take a look at the hoodthat actually comes in the box and seeit's stretchyit's made of a hyper wore material whichis Nikes weren't you wear or compressivewear the hydro pull means that the poolsor wicks water away or moisture awayfrom your face when you're wearing it soeven though it'll get hot and you'll getwarm you'll get sweaty not going to feelthat sweat on your face that's somethingthat I really liked about the materialon the inside it's also just like Nikesother hyper warm stuff it's kind of likethis fleece material on the insidethat's really warm and now let's get tomy favorite part just about how you wearit and does it keep you warm enoughso here's the first way you wear it youcan wear it as a full neck gaiter notsure if you guys understood that so youcan wear it as a full night Gator soeverything is covered from your nosedown and everything from above your eyesso the only thing that's exposed is youreyes and it keeps you super warm you canstill hear everything you can still talkthrough it and it still keeps you warmand it wicks sweat away the other secondway that you can wear it is just bypulling this down underneath the chin ifit gets too warm you can pull this downyou see you have free speaking abilityit still covers your ears and the top ofyour head so this is the third way thatyou can wear it and wearing at thatthird way you see you have this area atthe back you know that's kind of huggeddown after you take off the hood and Iactually did not get in the way of myhelmet whatsoever at all or my uniformor my play so that's something I reallylike about it that you guys might havebeen wondering we'll get to the last wayand that's just a neck warmer and that'shaving everything down the hood off andthe mouth covering down and you can justwear it around your neck so that way ifyou get too hot you don't have to pulleverything off you can just quickly pullit down so because these four options Ireally liked this net warmer or hydropole hood there are two men watch outfor using this product and the first oneis just the thickness of the hood eventhough it's a very thin layer I knowhelmet fitting is very particular tomultiple ball players so the one thingthat you want to know is the chin strapmakes it a little differently when youhave that extra layer built in that'sgoing to change the actual fitment ofyour helmetjust a tad the same thing with the toplayer so it's just those two watch outas you have the product just know thatyou may have to adjust your chin strapby newly as you put on the hydro polehood I did see this come in two colorsit came in the black with the red insideand then I also saw it come in a whitewith the red inside I haven't seen anyother colors there is another product onthe market that's not the hyper warmhood from Nike so just if you're lookingfor the product make sure that you'relooking for the winter wear one it's thehyper warm one and not the regular hoodit did retail for about twenty-fivedollars you can find it on most sportssites I haven't seen it in the storesbut definitely check out yourmajor sports sites for this hook if youliked this quick review remember give mea

wanted to make sure that you guysgot a special look at this one inparticularjust because of this dope packaging[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif

don't forget to follow him on ig aswell tell him dj sent you solet's go ahead and get into this becausewe have a lot to go over starting withthe box this is the shipping box thatyou will receivein the mail if you were able to orderthis from conceptsnow this was available last week he gotthis from the concepts websiteretail was roughly around 250 bucks andas you know that's a lot more than youwould typically pay for a pair ofsbs but at the same time you are payingfor the experience and the packagingand everything that comes with this pairin particular compared to the 120 dollarprice point that you would see onsneakers app so looking at the box righthere it has all the same stuffall around the box and on the box itreads concepts oven on fireroast your friends in front of theirfriends and then it has a bunch ofdifferent random stuff on herehigh quality h2o just and it's earlydon't smoke crack don't you can coldcereali think who's okay so there's a bunch alot of random words right here i don'tknow if this is some like puzzle orsomething that they've createdto make i don't know this is likesomething that they got going on but yesthis has a lot of weird words on it soenough of that let's go ahead and crackthis box open and see what's insideso first thing right here we have theovenvibes of the box so looking at the boxright here it looks like an oven whichis crazy like the concept behind thisaloneand i know the place is called conceptso i'm gonna say concept a lotbut this is just honestly a dope conceptandif you look back here on this side it'sjust like smoking and everythingbut if you look on the front side of itright here it has all the sizes andeverything right here in the frontso we are looking at a size 10 and ahalfand it says concepts x nike sb dunk hightur duncanokay now opening this up right here bruhquality is there for sure it's like it'sallis there like a magnet on here orsomething i don't know but the materialeverything the qualityeverything behind that alone a1 for surefirst thing that we have on top righthereyou have your nerf packaging you gotyour uhpie you got some corn with butter yougot yourmashed potatoes and gravy and then yougot the turkey football right hereon the inside so it's got the nerf withthe concepts on the back right hereand then you got the nerf whistle ballso as you know it's got the thanksgivingvibes and typically on thanksgiving youplay in a turkey bowl so they had toincorporate the footballand me personally i really love thattouch so the next thing right here wehave a piece of paper which is supposedto represent the turkeyand on that it has a concept logo and itsays concepts as wellas you can see right here and then afterthat we got the shoe so i'm thinkingthis might be a special boxjust for this specific release as weknow typically on sb's when they have aspecial releasethey typically do the rainbow box andthen when they have the regular releaseto the publicthey do just a regular sb box i hopethey do the rainbow box for the regularrelease as wellwe shall see so on the inside of thisbox right here it's kind of dope becauseyou got the burnerbut it also could look like the c forthe concepts logo which is super dopeyou got the fire everything going insideright here where the turkey cooks sothe presentation alone just a1 like theydid a great joband typically on sneakers you get youknow a couple pair of laces or somethingmay go with it or the box may look alittle bit cool butthis is an experience you're literallypurchasing an experienceand this is something that you couldshow all your friends when they comeover and like bro check this out andthey gotta do this andi think when there's so many steps toopening just to get to a pair of shoesi think that's always dope i knowsometimes it can get a little tediousbut at the same timei think you're paying for thatexperience and for the 250 buckssaying that the shoe is worth so muchwhich we'll talk about later on theresale valuei think it's worth it okay so we haveseen the packaging and now it's time tolook at the shoes so like i said beforewe have the all-over rainbow print boxand then on the tag right here reads thesame thing nike sb dunk high proquick strike size 10 and a half retail120 bucksnow that's for the regular pair withoutall the packagingbut this dunk is still a regular sb dunkwhich retails at 120 bucksnow opening up the box you have an extrapair of socks right hereokay with the concept stitch right herei'm assuming this is supposed to be likea bird's leg you got the bird's legright here with the claw down here atthe end of the socksretail on these is dollars i think thisall comes in the same packagingand let's go ahead and get into thisshoe oh we got the shoeokay so first impressions of this shoehonestly i was more excited aboutthe packaging than i am the actual shoejust becauseit's just not for me i appreciateall of the work that went into this shoetrust mei appreciate the materials they lookamazingwhich we will get into a second but formei just don't see myself rocking theseand i wouldn't mind if i did or didn'tget them or not soas i i know i know it's not the popularopinion so let's go ahead and startbreaking down this shoe let's talk aboutthe styles cuts and materials the thingsthat i do appreciate about the shoeand then we'll see what you guys thinkat the end of the video with the polestarting with the outsole you have yourclassic nike sboutsole you got kind of like a two-tonewith a little light tan and kind of likethat salmon kind of color right there toitand then working our way up to themidsole you got a lighter kind of pinkcolorway on the midsole with the pinkcolored stitchand then going to the upper now theupper is mixed with a bunch of differentmaterialsand i appreciate everything about theshoe again i am not knocking this shoeat all so these are supposed torepresent a mallard duck if you don'tknow what it looks like here's a picturefor you to check it out but basicallythat's the kind of concept and vibe thatthey're going behind itto create this shoe and i understand andi appreciateall of the execution and everythingabout these bruh like honestlythey did a great job and when i seenfirst images of the shoei think that's what really made me notlike it as much because even if you lookat the image on sneakers appthey don't look nearly good as they doin person materialseverything quality a1 presentation a1they did a great job on this shoelooking at the toe cap right here youkind of got like a shaggy materialaround the front you got a light tansuede toe cap here on the toplooking at the mid foot on the sidepanels you kind of got that ductmaterial kind of looking like it's aduck featheron the sides right here on both sidesand then you have a navy blue swoosh onthe inside of the foot it's kind of gotthat green iridescent vibe compared tothe blue on the outside the swooshesalmost look like they're 3m but they'reactually not going to the back of thefoot right here you got a softer vibe onthe materialkind of feels like a little teddy bearor something like that you got a nicelittle suede on the back end of the hillright hereand then you got a white sock liner andon the inside you got images of duckstrees and the logos concept right hereon the inside of the sock linerthe white leather bruh this is nicegoing to the tongue you have anall green tongue similar to the swooshon the inside of the footyou got a yellow leather nike sb logotab right heresays duck high pro instead of dunk highproi think that's pretty dope you have tanlaces that come equipped with the shoesalreadyyou have an additional pair of yellowlaces and a pair of burgundy laces to gowith these as welllet me know what color laces you wererocking these down below in the commentsection so here's the questiondj if you like all these things aboutthe shoe and the presentation and allthat stuffwhy are you still hating on it why don'tyou like it honestly like i saidit's just a very i don't know likemaybe a collector's piece but it's justnot hitting home for mei don't like hunting ducks you know it'sjust i don't know it's just not for meandi could respect a lot of shoes out inthis world that's just not for me soi think there's a lot of hype behind theresale price and that's why there's ademand for this sneakerand causing people want to have it andhonestly for 120 dollarswith the materials and everything thatthey did to this shoe if i could buythese for retaili could see myself hanging on to themjust because i got them for 120 bucksjust based off of the materials and howwell they did on the shoebut i would never ever ever pay resalefor a sneaker like thisjust to say that i had it i think

today we're gonna take a look at all thedifferent new 19 material models to giveyou guys an idea about which of theboots you should splash the cash on andwe're gonna look at everything all theway from the SuperDuper wicked materialElite models over the first take downtheir pro boots and then of course ontothe cheaper options the Academy versionsto give you guys an idea about what'swhat and which of the bootsyou should get so without further adolet's take a nose dive into the techjungle that is the new material rangenow the new Nike Mercurial release herefollows the new Nike naming pattern witha bit of a twist because while Nikedecided to call both of these the NikeMercurial elite boots they also decidedto stick with the vapor name for thelow-cut Aleppo simply because the vaporname is so iconic that you don't want tokill it off so the Superfly 6 elite herewill cost you 270 euros whereas thevapor will only set you back 240 yearsand that difference that you're payingthe extra 30 euros for is basically thedynamic fit collar on the Superfly 6 andthen of course the fact that the upperfor some reason seems to be a little bitsofter on the Superfly when you take itout of the box but apart from that thetag is exactly the same on the two bootsand here we're talking a 360 degreeknitted upper there's an integratedtongue in the outsole has been splitinto two pieces one piece is theanatomical internal feedback chassis andthen we got the two nylon pots on theoutsole for a bit better stability andalso of course to hold this does thisACC on the upper and you got theseknitted engineered 3d speed whips togive you a bit more texture and grip onthe ball and of course to top everythingoff inside of the insole this is 3dpattern that interlocks with the P backchassis to make sure it doesn't slidearound inside the food and stays inplace and because the Superfly 6 hasthis extra piece of material in thedynamic fit collar it also weighs a bitmore than the vapor so in my size us 7its 188 grams compared170 grams on the vapor 12 again in mysize us seven but on your feet both ofthese boots feel like absolute hardcorespeed machines and I love themof course both the Superfly 6 and vapor12 also come in an Ag version again withthe two nylon parts the split outsoleand we also have the SG Pro anti-clockversion where the soleplate fills outthe entire bottom of the boot becauseotherwise the anti-clock tech reallywouldn't make any sense so it has to bethere oh and by the way if you're newhere and you like the stuff that we doplease go and hit that subscribe buttonand turn on then notifications becausenot only will we be super psyched aboutitwe'd also try and return the favor bygiving you a ton of videos on bootskills and whatnot on almost a dailybasis so thank you and now back to theboots moving on to the first take downversion it was formerly known as thenike mercurial Valachi this bad boyright here is called the Nike MercurialVapor 12 pro now sadly I haven't beenable to get my hands on Big BrotherSuperfly 6 pro but what I can tell youis that the only difference between thevapor and the Superfly is that theSuperfly has the dynamic fit collar andthe vapor twelve role it doesn't butwhat's pretty good about the problemsthat I like a lot and I see as a prettybig improvement is the fact that Nikekept a lot of the good ideas from theelite ones but only way the lessexpensive and should we say high techinnovative execution but still what youget here on the vapor 12 Pro is apremium synthetic upper that actuallyreminds me a lot of the teaching of weknow from the vapor Elevens and herethere's also a CC and you still get thespeed whips engineered into the upperitself just like we know it from theknitted versions I mean it's pretty goodwhat's even cooler is that even on thepro models the takedown versions youstill get that internal anatomicalchassis that has this contouredsensation to it where your foot sinksinto the play of course the two outsoleparts are made of compressed nylon likeon the elite models insteadthey're made out of pee backs whichisn't as light or as responsive but on atakedown it's still very very impressiveand what's even more impressive is thatyou also get the 3d Nike equippedtexture underneath the insole thatinterlocks with the chassis to make sureit stays in place so you could say thatin essence the pro models here arebasically synthetic versions of thelabels and especially on the low-cutvapor it has a pretty should we sayvapor 11 ish vibe to it it's not aspremium or as good on feet but stillwhen you wear it you definitely feel alot like you're wearing a vapor 11 andfor a hundred and fifty years for theSuperfly and 120 years for the vapor 12pros they're very very good optionsdespite the fact that they do weigh alittle bit more so the vapor 12 proshere in my size relatively small u.s. 70weighs a hundred and eighty two gramswhich means that if I only had 120 yearsI definitely be rocking this he said thebest take down on the market I don'tknow but it's up there but if you're nottoo keen on spending that kind of moneyanyway you should take a look at theAcademy models the Superfly six Academyand the vapor 12 Academy which are madewith a slightly cheaper synthetic thathas this micro textured finish to it andfor the price point I gotta be honestit's actually quite nice and it givesyou a pretty decent grip on the ballwith that set though it's not as thinnor as soft as the upper we know on themore expensive models and in general thewhole upper package the wholeconstruction of the bootsit isn't as thin or a software's premiumand high tech as we know from the moreexpensive models but that's kind of whatyou have to expect and you have to livewith on the lower price points and alsothis dynamic fit collar on the Superflysix Academy as you can see it's a bitmore loose and less premium knitted thanit is on the higher end models it'sstill hey if you want it it's there andactually it's relatively soft againthat's just what you have to expect butto look at the big deal on the Academyboots we have to flip them round becausehere we're talking the brand new mainsoleplate the mg soleplate which isbasically the Nike equivalent to the F Ga G outsoles that we see out there whichmeans that they're made to be worn bothon FG and artificial pitches now that ishappening because we get these here twofront bladed Chevron's that's that arealso on the back to give you a bit ofaggressive traction and also to help youbreak a little faster but then the restof the studs are these hollowed-outconical studs that are better and moreimportantly safer to use on artificialpitches and also the front of the platehere the tip actually goes higher up onthe boot to try to prevent a bitter soleseparation happening as fast as it wouldon a normal FG pair of boots so that'sactually pretty clever and you could saythen we are actually talking about atrue multi-purpose outsole here and forninety years for the Superfly sixAcademy and seventy-five so the vapor 12Academy it's actually a pretty good dealI mean you get the silhouette you get avery good outsole and the materialsactually aren't that bad for the pricepoint I'm just sayingso my friends hopefully you now know abit more about the new mercurial bootsin nearly the pro and the Academy rangesand to be honest with you guysI'm

control with an appwith your phone it's called adapt BB andthey'll sell for $350 this is thereality Back to the Future predictedright down to bit being the mostpowerful man in the world the way theshoes work is you it's really easy youjust download the app you create anaccount create a password and a user IDyou sync it to your shoes and then youjust tap your phone until you have theperfect fit or you could just tie yourown damn shoelaces[Applause]it's gonna be awkward when LeBron tellsthe coach he can't play because heforgot to charge his shoes than I'd bebored you have to charge these shoesaround every two weeks but what if youforget can't go out tonight my shoes areat 3% you know I've been working on myown line of smart clothing smart appareland in fact right now and we're still inthe testing phase but right now I amwearing a prototype of the first-everself zipping fly you see that you shouldsee me in the men's room I go in with myhands up like this you know these newNike shoes sound ridiculous but I alsoam dying to check them out unfortunatelythey don't come out until next month butwe came up with a fun idea we went outon the street this afternoon we askedpeople they wanted to test the newself-lacing shoes out except we didn'tgive them self-lacing shoes we gave hima pair of regular Nike slip-onsthen we had to tell us if they couldfeel the laces tightening even thoughthere were no laces in the shoe totighten them humming guys one of ourriders came up as ideas when I was likehi this is not gonna work nobody's gonnabelieve this I'm both happy and ashamedto say every single person who triedthem fell for it in tonight's edition oflye witness news[Applause][Music][Applause]so the way these work is they'recontrolled by an app okay so when Ipress right and left each shoe is goingto lace up so I'm pressing the right oneand let me know when you feel it are youfeeling it tightening on the right yeahdoes that feel good yes of this okay I'mgoing to switch to the left okay are youfeeling that oh yeah it's just a justiceto your foot and like it hugs your footbasically that's what it feels like theyfeel really comfortable so you think itdoes a better job than if you were tolace it yourselfeasier job so I'm gonna press on theright foot and you just tell me how itfeelsdo you feel it tightening yeah what doesit care like it's just definitelygetting tighter and you can feel I havereally wide feets you can tell itdefinitely form to your foot a lotbetter and there's also a reflexologymode which will give your feet a littlebit of a massage so do you mind tryingthat as well it almost feels it almostfeels warm or like not a vibrating butyou can tell that it's moving around alittle bit and does it feel good yeah Ifeel I just kind of like it's almostlike suctioning up against my ankles andsecuring them in place there's also afeature that has some heat if you wantto try that also yeah I can press onthat it should be the heat comes fromthe ball of your foot in that area Idon't know if you feel it yeah I feel alittle warming sensation how did thatfeel it's interesting I've never feltthat in a sneaker before so there's alsoa cooling feature for the summertime soI'm just going to switch it to that youcan kind of feel that transition fromthe heat to the cooling so that's that'sawesomea lot of the problem I have a problemwith my toes being cold in the frontthere's actually a special toe warmingfunction if you didn't want heat allaround so I can turn that on too if youwant to see if that makes a differenceit's sort of just like a little bit of aboostOh Oh I feel that yeah yeah does it feelgood yeah it does you feel it tighteninga little yeah what does it feel likeit's like a slight squeeze but I feellike which feels really great I havelike really high arches oh and so it'sit's really working out for meso you said you have high arches there'sactually a function on this where youcan increase or decrease the archsupport so I'm gonna increase the archand the right sneaker right now tell usif you're feeling it or when I shouldstop okay stop how's that feel it feelsgreat it feels like the ones I get fromlike the insoles that I get

so i'm out in vegas right now and i wasmoseying along and we went past the shoepalette so i was like you know what wegot to stop insidewe saw the air more up tempo i seenthese on my sneakers after today and itsays they're not even set to releaseuntil the 16thso you know what that means i had topick them up and i got to give you guysa quick reviewwelcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit that subscribe button don't forgetto hit the bell notificationfor every time i upload a new video andmake sure you hit that like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm ohso much so like i was saying earlier irandomly saw these pop up on sneakersapp and i'm like bro these just came outa few years ago maybe like four or fiveyears ago and i still have that pairfrom that retroso when i get back home i'll make surethat i give you guys a full comparisonbecause just off of initial look fromthis sneaker right here they definitelylook different than the previous pairthat we saw in the pasti would say overall materials andeverything like that look very similarbut when it comes to the red and thecolor of this shoei feel like these have a darker tone tothem and i'm looking forward to showingyou guys the comparison when i get backhomeso let's take a quick look at thissneaker real quick i want to show youguys the ins and outs of it and thenwhen we get back home we can do thecomparison and whatnotbut i think overall it's definitelystill a solid shoe and i'm lookingforward to the releaseeven though i already have them now idon't know why what's going on with theshoe pallets herethey got them early or something ormaybe sneaker zap is dropping them latei'm not sure let me know down below inthe comment sectiondid these come out at your local shoepalace or other retailers we don't havea shoe palace in portland so i can't saythat they do come out there buti have seen shoe palaces get pretty muchall the releases when it comes to the grstuffand this falls into that category it'skind of funny because this actually usedto be a really really rare shoeback in the day and then when they retroit became more available and now we'reseeing it coming out againso taking a quick look at the outsoleyou got a all-white outsole with a blackswoosh on the front in the back lookingat the midsole you have a silver airbubble on the inside with the red andwhite tone midsole around the shoegoing to the upper you have an all rednubuck type materiala large red jewel style nike swoosh hereon the back of the foot1996 reminiscing the og version thatcame outway way back in the day and one of myfavorite hits the black patent leatherair all around the foot or the shoesuper super clean touch to the shoe anddefinitely makes these things poplooking at the laces you have threeelastic straps here in all blackand then two black eyelids here on thecenter of the foot going to the tongueyou have a big white leather patch righthere with the nike swooshand then on the inside of the sock lineron the back side of the tongue it's allwhite hereif i had to ask anybody i think thiswould easily be a copi know some people don't really like itor they say the shoe is really reallybulkyi wear a size 13 so this shoe definitelylooks like a big tankbut with the color blocking and schemeof this sneaker it definitely works whenit's all white version of this shoethis thing looks way too big and i cannever own an all-white version buttypically when i go with the black orthe navy blue olympic styleit's definitely a goal for me all rightrate this shoe out of 10.i'm gonna give it a solid eight why areeightand not the the black and white jointsthat i likeuh i think this red is just a tad bitdark but i do likeuh the black air with the red with thewhite soulit's not like my favorite shoe ever butit's definitely clean i definitely wouldrock itokay okay i can respect that i'll givethis shoecome on give me some energy trey i'llgive this shoe a seven sure that's thesame injuryi'll get a shoe at seven becauseseven yeah okay becauseit's cool like if you're gonna behooping and if you play for the rightteam but you were really hooping thosei'm saying i'm just saying like for thelookbecause when you put these on with somejeans like when people be putting theseon with jeansit tells me something aboutso it's like a seven because oh i meansomebody could pull these off you couldbe dipped like you just got to bedipped in these ones all right so if yougot dipped what would you wearman i don't even i don't know that'smaybe why i gotta sit huhsome swatches go just you know like okayif you justlike go to the gym type of you walkinginto the gymget him out of hereuh i'll probably say a 7-2 this is coolthey're just too bulky for meum i like the og colorwaybut this this is this is cool this isdefinitely a chill shoego to the gym uhhit the grocery store but other thanthat these mad bulk y'all know i'm gonnahave toyeah i'm gonna probably go with a sevenas welli mean they're they're a classic shoeright butthey're bulky the air the patent leatherair with the suedeback is like i don't know it's notreally doing it for meum so if they were gifted to you wouldyou like be happy oryou know yeahyeah you're just not trying to pay 160i'm not trying to pay onceand like trey said like you can't rockthese with jeansi mean so it's a hard shoe to plant anoutfit for you know what i meangive us the black and white pair yeahgive us the olympic pairand then give us the white and red trimpairthe supreme joints is cool we can holdoff on the gold onesthose are hot for certain occasions thered and black ones that's it they'retough to pull off that's the only thingit's a clean colorway it's a super dopeshoe it looks goodbut to wear them just like functionalityyeah and it's not it's not a varsity redeitherso that's tough to make the tongue islike way brighter than the material inthe shoeso overall it looks like the whole crewis gonna go mainly likeseven one eight so we'll just call it aseven for the crewfor me i love it i love it no

so there's been a lot of hype aroundnike dunks and a lot of people beenhitting me up asking me the questiondj what's the difference between dunksand jordan ones they look the same so intoday's video i'm gonna be breaking downthe differences between these two shoesthat way you guys have a betterunderstanding and knowing what kind ofproduct you're purchasingwhat's up with you guys how you doinghow you been if you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit that subscribe button don't forgetto hit the bell notificationfor every time i upload a new video andmake sure you hit that like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm ohso much so first things first if youknow anything about this channel wealways have to talk about the history ofa sneaker first that way you have abackground understanding of the shoe andwhere it came from why the hype is heretodayand why every sneaker head should alwaysrespect classic og models something likethe nike dunk or the air jordan onenow i know every original sneaker isn'tdope to every single person but at theend of the day if it wasn't for thehomage of the sneakers from the pastwe would never have the hype of thesneakers for the current sowith that being said let's go ahead andget into it back in 1985nike decided to release a promotionalpack of the nike dunk highbe true to your school series and had abunch of different series with collegeteamsthat they sponsored that they hadwearing their sneakers and their colorsthis pair in particular that we'relooking at today is a retro from 2016paying homage to the og colorway fromback in the day also in 1985 we had aperson named michael jordan i'm not sureif you heard of him beforebut he came out with his own sneaker andlooked pretty similar to the nike duckhigh but they made a couple tweaks andthey made it his version and i'm tellingyou right now there are actually a lotof differences between these two shoesi know if you look at it like this youmay say oh yeah they look the same butonce you start really breaking it downyou're gonna notice there's a lot ofdifferences between these two sneakersso looking at this photo right herethese are some original colorways thatreleased in 1985that came out to the public that peoplehad an opportunity to purchaseand look at the differences between thecolorways the color blocking in adifferent style between the twobut i'm telling you right now there's alot more to it than just thatas you guys know there are a bunch ofdifferent versions of the nike dunk highyou have sb you got lunars you got somany different versions of this sneakerand then when it comes to the jordan 1high it's the same situation there are abunch of different variations of thesebut i wanted to make sure that i broughtyou two versions right here that aresimilar to the og styles that are retroin today's marketand that are obviously on everybody'smust-have list so let's go ahead and getstarted breaking down the shoe okay sofirst things first let's take a look atthe box this is the classic og style forthe air jordan one boxthis is a special edition box that's alittle bit different than we wouldtypically getso i made sure that i brought an orangebox that you would actually get on mostnike dunk highs and that's the one thatyou would see right here this all orangebox right here was more of a premiumversion from this special pack that theydid in 2016but typically what you're going to seefor a nike dunk high is going to be thisall red box with the big white brandingon the topnow looking at the outsoles as you seeright here they look very very similarbut when you see these closer up detailshots you can see there is a differencein the patterns and then the width ofthe sneakerthe nike dunk high is a little bit moreof a narrow sneakerand the air jordan 1 has a wider outsoleto it and againas you see in the images right herethere's a big difference when you lookat the stars at the toe of the foot orthe definition here in the center of thefoot now working our way up to themidsoleit's the same thing yes some people maysay it looks the samebut when you see these side by side youcan see there is a clear difference theair jordan one has a classic texturedpattern right under the stitch line hereon the midsoleand then if you look at the dunk highyou can see there's a couple lines thatgo up and down verticallybut there's no real pattern to it andit's pretty smooth now taking it to theupperone thing that i can say on this pair inparticulari do low-key like the leather on thenike dunk highjust a little bit more than this stormblue pair right herenow i know this was a premium versionthat they did release so i have to dotake that with a grain of saltbut when it comes to quality for thedollar i would say these are worth itjust a little bit more to mejust because this sneaker right here 120bucksthis one right here 160 bucks typicallyon a nike dunk high retail is going tobe anywhere from 100 to 130 bucksand if you're thinking about a jordan 1you're thinking about anywhere from 160to 175on the retail price for that so ifyou're looking at price alonethis one is going to be a bang for thebuck in that aspect so i'm going topoint out three similarities for youguys and then maybe about five or sixdifferences between the two shoesand then everything else should bepretty obvious for you that i don'treally need to say which i'll show youin photosas well so let's go ahead and get intothat so one thing that is pretty similarbutslightly different is the tongue if youlook at the nike with the swooshbranding here on the nike dunk highyou can see that it is very similar tothe og high air jordan onebut that air jordan 1 always comes withthe nike with the air underneath it soif you're ever confused on thedifference between the twoalways look for the nike air on thetongue compared to just the nike withthe swoosh but other aspects like thetongue material or the sock liner aroundit they look pretty similarit's kind of hard for somebody to knowthe difference between the two on thatpartanother thing that is pretty similar onthese two sneakers as well is theperforated dots on the toe of the shoeand i know it's kind of hard for peopleto tell but the dots on the nike dunkhigh are just a little bit smaller thanyou would see on the air jordan one toeanother thing that looks very verysimilar to a lot of people is where theswoosh is placed at on the sneakerit is in the center of the foot righthere but the placement on the backaround the heelis just a little bit higher on the nikedunk and a little bit lower towards themiddle of the heelon the jordan one now let's get into themajor differences because as you can seei'm showing you a lot of similaritiesbut they are still just a little bitdifferent from each other one thing thati have always noticed on air jordan onesis when you look at the three holes hereat the eyelets at the front of the toeas you can see the leather flap overlapsthat seam line that you see right hereand it's stitched right above itbut when you look at the nike dunk asyou can see it's separated into twopiecesand the whole lining that comes aroundit is above that lineso for me that's always a big giveawaywhen i'm looking at the two shoes and isee the toe of the foot i personallylike the way they cut the air jordan 1just a little bit morelet me know what you think down below inthe comment section another hugegiveaway for air jordan 1 highs is youhave the wings logo right here that saysair jordanand then on the nike dunk there'snothing at all so that's a big giveawayas welljust looking at the side part around theankle you can clearly tell thedifference between the twonow looking at the cuts of the materialsand how they went about stitching theside of the footis another big thing on the back end ofthe air jordan 1 you basically have acap that goes around the back of thefoot then you have your nike swoosh thatcomes around of thatand then you have your white leatherthat goes on that side and then you haveyour imitated strap line that runsaround the top of that with a littlecollar above thatand i can't forget to mention the littlesquare patch that brings it all togetherhere in the center of the foot sobasically you got six different piecesall coming together right here to createthe heel of the air jordan one now whenyou look at the heel and the back endand the flaps of the nike dunk there'sone thing that's a biggiveaway like i just said the flaps soas you can see right hereyou can unlace this area and it'llactually come apartand you can have the flaps hanging outto the side typically on mostog high air jordan ones they don't havethe flaps i understand we haveoff-white we have zoom we have othercolorways that do have the flaps ajkoeverything like that for the most partwe have typicallythis style right here and i know we'regonna have people in the comment sectionbut dj you forgot the rookie of theyearsand the i get it bro i get it i know youknow a thing or two about shoes tooi understand we're just trying to helpeverybody here so anyways back to theheelif you look at the heel on the back ofthe nike dunk right here you can seethere's four stitch lines above the heelcapand then there's a stitch line down thecenter of the heel cap looking like twodifferent piecescompared to the one that you would seehere on the jordan one and then rightabove that you have a little squarepatch that's kind of similar to thejordan onebut this is actually a looped piece ofleather that's almost like a pull tabbut it's not and i'm not exactly surewhat exactly you would use that forbecause you can't even fit your fingerin itand i don't know like what the purposefully is of that so somebody pleaseexplain that for me down below in thecomment section becausetrue functionality i would never usethat loophole for anythingmaybe people tie their shoelaces all theway through the back of it or somethingi don't know drop a comment down belowso for the last thing that really standsout to meas you see on the side panel of the airjordan 1 there's like a vtyped or l-type shape whatever you wantto call it but it's a stitch line thatgoes here and downand if you look at the nike dunk there'sno stitch line right there sotypically when i look at air jordan onesi'm looking at the toe caplooking at the perforated dots theeyelets right here around the front thenike air on the tongue the wings logothe capon the back or that stitch line on theside of the foot to tell the differencesbetween the nike dunk highso i also went to instagram and i askedthe people which one do you guys likemoredo you like jordan 1 or do you like thenike dunk high and this one was a majorlandslide asexpected 95 chose the air jordan 15 chose the nike dunk high when it comesto price resale hypeexclusivity all that different stuffdopeness collaborations materialswhatever it isboth of these sneakers are classics irespectboth shoes me personally i have more airjordan ones in my collection because ido like air jordan ones morebut at the same time i always got tomake sure i got some dunks in mycollection as wellbecause i mean bruh like you gotta haveit but another example when it comes tothatis price right when you look atsomething like the air jordan one storein bluetwo similar colorways right here thissneaker is going for like 800 to athousand dollarswhen you look at something like thekentucky dunk high this sneaker is goingfor like 500 or 600 bucksso don't get me wrong you bought thisshoe for 110120 whatever it may be you still got abig profitsame with this shoe you bought it for170 bucks you got a big profitso that right there proves to me alonehow dope both sneakers aresome people can pick sides and chooseand other people can be on both sidesand just loveand appreciate both sneakers i'm thetype of one that's still in the middlewhen it comes to that aspect i wouldchoose jordan ones over dunks if i couldonly have one but luckily i'm fortunateenough to be able to have both of mycollections so at the end of the day ihope this video was extremely helpfuland helped you just get a betterunderstandingon the two shoes the differences and thesimilarities and why people may thinkthey are the same or whatever may bewhich one do you guys like more thestorm blue or the kentuckyi'm excited to hear what you guys haveto say i got a couple more comparisontype videos like this for you guys witha lot of sneakers that are very similarbut different at the same timeand a lot of people get misconceptionsof the two so i'm always happy andexcited to help you guys understand thedifferences between sneakers becauseevery day we have new people becomingsneaker heads and they just don't knoweverything so don't bash people in thecomment section saying oh my gosh ican't believe you don't know thisbruh there was some point in time whereyou didn't know either we all had tostart somewhere remember thathonor respect the shoe game and respecteach other i appreciate you guys asalways i'll see you in another video i'mgone peaceyo if you

mordom trainee acts foggy little morningout there just past that fog it is thetrack this is gonna be the first outdoortrack workout I've done and we are goingto run it in the shoes that you have alljust been like Tara Tarrant Aaron arethey for real those are the Nike Flyknitfor percents yes they are for real butthere's a lot that you need to knowabout them because they are mad cheddarkind of pricey so many snow bags how amI gonna get to the track before youspend that kind of dough watch thisreview[Music]Wowtraining axe that was not a pile ofquality work before I get to talkingabout the Nike Flyknit look at what Iwas trying to knock out hard efforts inthink I'm about a week too early onInstagram I'll put up a video with thedescription for that entire speedworkout is like 35 minutes but if thereweren't snow it'd be a good quality 35minutes that you could do all rightthese babies all right trainee axe let'stalk about the Nike Vapor fly fly knit4% that's not easy to say all right sowe've got to talk about the twoelephants in the room number one theseare taking over the running world andthere is a ton of hype there probablyhasn't been a more hyped shoe and aslong as I can think and the second thingis they're expensive they are twohundred and fifty dollars u.s. probablythe most expensive shoe and there'ssomething I'm gonna explain thatprobably makes them an even moreexpensive shoe when you consider itregarding the hype for this there havebeen races that over half the field hadthis shoe lined up in transition when Iwas talking to cam Werth in LA he wastalking about the fact where as long asyou don't have a competing shoe sponsorhe was like why would anyone wearanything but this the science just goesto support this I'll get into a lot ofthat so the specs this is a road racingshoe from Nike it is 6.9 ounces in aimsize 9 that is also a woman's shoebecause these are unisex shoes it is abig heel to toe drop with a 31millimetre heel and a 21 millimeterforefoot so if you are somebody who hastraditionally run on a flat shoe this isgonna feel a little bit weird but stillworks explain why so as far as claims ofthe speed the name of it is the Nike 4%and then it's claiming that it's goingto make you 4% faster or 4% moreefficient what I heard from people thatwere testing this before it came out isthat actually at Nike it was more like3.1 percent and that's what everyone washearing was 3.1 percent and then it cameout and they were like oh they roundedup from three point one to four that'snot how rounding works Nike but there'sstill a lot of science to back this upand one study that was published in theJournal of Sports Medicine 18 runnerswere tested at anywhere from about 5:21per mile to he was 653 per mile andtheir efficiency in this shoe versus twoother popular shoes was measured andthat efficiency in every single one ofthe runners regardless of whether theywere a heel striker or a forefootstriker increased anywhere from about1.6 percent to about six point threepercent clustering around four percentmore efficient now the mechanism thatcreates that efficiency is one theenergy return and that is a function ofhow much energy comes into the shoe fromlanding and instead of dissipating outthe side of the shoe with heat itactually gets returned to moving youforward now most shoes out there on themarket are somewhere in between about 50and 65 percent energy return going intopushing you forward the previous leadingshoe was the adidas boost which measuredin the high 70s this measured anall-time high of 80 efficiency though isreally just a measurehow much workload does it take for youto move yourself forward and energyreturn it's not a perfect science we'remore energy return means that you gofaster so in testing practicallyspeaking what does this actually do wehad a guy that is here locally that heis a complete data junkie and he didtesting against this versus all of hisother favorite shoes and he found thatthis was four seconds faster perkilometer or six and a half secondsfaster per mile and I basically foundthat same thing that at the sameperceived effort somewhere around fourto eight seconds faster feels the samesecret is two things one is that zoomxfoam by Nike at the bottom that isdesigned to be a cushy so it takes aload off your body and it's still nicetowards the end of a half marathon or amarathon but B also is very springy soit shoots you forward there's also acarbon plate that goes through theentire shoe and as you can see it's areally stiff shoe so that carbon plateis designed to load up tension and snapyou forward shooting you forward in thedirection that you want to go instead ofhaving all that energy dissipate out theside love you back all the science asidemy experience with them has been reallygood I use them for a few training runsleading into Half Ironman Puerto Ricoand then in half ironman Puerto Rico Ifound that they certainly helped so theywere faster in those training runs Iwasn't necessarily very fast in PuertoRico but if you look at the data from mystride running foot pod what you can seeis that my form didn't really break downI've never had a half marathon in a HalfIronman where I stayed with the sameform throughout the entire course of therace so I think that's a function ofbeing more efficient and this foamtaking a little bit of load off my bodyI found that the best feeling that I gotfrom this shoe is around say 10k racepace or up to marathon race pace Ididn't really like it for like thatsuperfast 200-meter effort or a onekilometer like twitchy fast whereeverything's flailing because it's likethis was too stiff to really let my bodyfunction naturally so it was like thatthat difficult tempo pace that I reallyliked also the sole on this is reallyreally basic it is not designed forreally anything besides the track orroad running don't be using this ongravel off-road trails not what it's foras far as durability it's not gonna be avery durable shoe this is a race shoethis has been stated by Nike to besomewhere around a hundred mile shoe andif you look at forums online everyone'ssaying that around mile 80 hundred onehundred and fifteen but it starts losingits springiness now when you combinethat with the fact that it's a $250 shoeit's probably the most expensive dollarper mile shoe out there and that's justfact like it's made with this zoomx foamis actually pee backs foam pee backsPemex foam which is known for being veryforgiving very springybut degrading fairly quickly and thelast thing with regards to sizing if youdo end up choosing to get these go atleast one half size up with a thin sockone half size is perfect for me with athick sock it's starting to even stillget a little bit tight now the questionis should you buy this now going back wehaven't done this in a few weeks on thetrainee ak heads scale of zero to fivewhere zero is I don't really recommendanyone buy this at all but five is everysingle athlete should buy this I wouldactually give this a 2 out of 5 and theonly reason that I'm giving it such alow number is because it is so stinkinexpensive now that's not to say thatit's not a good shoe it's legit it doesexactly what it's supposed to do Ireally likeI'm probably going to run in it but noteveryone needs this shoe so that tonumber is an indication of it being agreat product but it's for a very niceit's for somebody who not only hasmultiple shoes somebody who wants a veryfast shoe for certain periods of timebut somebody who wants the best possibleshoe that they can get and somebodythat's moving fairly quickly if you'resomebody that's doing a race that youare slower than call it eight minutemiles eight thirty miles I don't know ifyou're gonna get the bang for the buckout of this so this is a very me sheshoe but for the right person it's agreat shoe I'm probably gonna be buyinga few of these over the next few years Ilike it a lot it's just damn expensivethere you go trainee acts that is theNike Vapor fly fly net four percent it'slegit and if you got the Chetta for itand the speed and the desire to get thebest shoe out there go for it I like itit looks slick it feels good just feellike I'm holding a precious item that isdisintegrating every single time I puther course later trainee axe hit thesubscribe button below,26,UCEaTAQbuyJ_FWOOQ5OsbK5A,Shop

the nike dunk low dusty olive[Music]i might actually just prefer thesebetter than the medium curriesand if you've already watched thatreview already you know how much i lovethat sneakerso that says it all now nike haveblessed me with these sneakers very veryearly these do release on the 21st ofapril no maynot these do release on the 21st of maythis year so only a couple weeks untilthey dropand i'll leave a link down below for youguys to purchaseas well and to my knowledge these arereleasing at 95 pounds at retail pricebut for the materials you're gettingthis is an absolute stealbut before we waffle on anymore youalready knowwhat's next we are gonna have a littlebutcher's hookat the box and it does come in your redstandardnike box but the product sticker doesreads nike dunk lowspecial edition and the officialcolorway is dusty oliveand pro gold now when i first looked atthem i could have sworn they were yellowbutthat clears it all up it is of course ashade of goldsand in my head i never would have thrownthese colors together on a sneaker butthat's why i'm not on the nike designteam these colorways just bang so welland is it just me or do these sneakersgive you that travis scott vibe but justlikekafu let's bring this video right backand have a closer lookat this sneaker now the nike dunk is assimple as it comes in terms of itsdesign you can doso much with the silhouettes the colorblocking on this sneaker of coursecontrast of olives browns and goldsbut most of the materials used are ofthis suedenow it's not as hairy and rough as themedium curries it's got away nicer and softer buttery feel andeven if you stroke the toe box forexampleit's got that sort of brush like effectto the suede panel and when that happensyou just knowthese are as premium as it gets so ofcourse the toe box is that brown coloralongside the mid panels and theoverlays are the same suedein that olive colorway and the nikeswooshes are more of a darker goldcompared to the laces and the outsolebutit does indeed work well now making ourways to the tongueit is of course in that brown nylon meshand because of the change in materialsit does look like a chocolate brown butthese do come with only gold lacesand it does work well i might thinkabout swapping them with white ones butfor meas it goes these look good and we've gotthat nike tab at the top with that goldnike branding on the insole it is inthat dusty olive colorway with the goldnike branding again and on the socklinerit isof that soft cotton feel making our waysto the back we've got that nike brandingin green just on top of that gold tabit is indeed the same shade as the nikeswooshes soit's more of a darker gold and thematerials underneaththat is the same of the tongue in thatbrown color now it is your standardwhite midsole that we all know and loveon the nike dunk but what contrasts themidsole very wellis this pro gold outsole now i feel likeif they went for a brown outsole thesewouldn't have banged as much so i'm verythankful they went for that goldit just gives it that extra pop now theone thing i am happy about that i canfinally doafter this video is actually wear thesei've been holding off for a couple weeksthat i've had themjust because i wanted to keep themand span but i was very very tempted totake these out for a test drive but nowi can i'm just gonna lace these bad boysup with a nice pair of

uniqueand this dusty olive pro gold version isrightup my alley even if i didn't get theseseeded to me by nikei would have tried to get theseregardless this colorway is justsuper super clean and unique but interms of the sizing this does fit verymuch true to size likemost dunks i have tried on and i'm nottalking about the sb dunki'm talking about your regular regulardunk because of the shape and the

on them as a nurseyou know unfortunately sometimes they dowhat have people thought about the shoesother nurses doctors anybody sayanything about them yeahalmost everybody and sometimes mypatients are like ohthey're so cute how do they compare toyour other ones that were umjust regular nike shoes that were notmade for nursing theyare different they're more comfortable iusually can't wear nikes becausei have like i need like arch support ilike like asicsbut these have helped a lot actuallythey feel good on the balls of my feetthey feelnice and padded we're on our feet for 12hours a day so we need a lot of supportthis is tate's shoe i'm gonna take itoff and make her go barefoot for asecondand i'm gonna get really far away so ican take off my mask it's held up prettywelldo i dare smell it

impressed they've held up reallywell this is some sort of plastic on theoutside that makes it so you can wipe itoff really easilyand i do like what she said about theinside of it that theit has really good support for her footyou can see that support like in thearch area and then the balls of her feetum it does have enough cushioning thatshe said that it's safe and then on thebottomthis is like a stick free material sothat nurses when they're walking ondifferent types of flooring whether it'sslipperyor whatever it should be a non-slip typeofmaterial on the bottom which are somethings that you don't get just from aregular shoeand unfortunately a lot of nurses justwear normal shoes becausethey get what they can afford and getwhat's available um the back of theseshoes are kind of weirdyou like the way that they are they'reeasy to get on and off i doi usually my old shoes i would just stepon the box becausei would try and get out in a hurry butthese are so nice they're super easy totake

do this we'regoing to do this long term it has like atechnical initiative they were veryreceptive almost like spongy andeverything like the information that theskaters were giving the dunk soul waslike here at the dunk stolen all theskate shoes rifleso like the skate shoes had like an inchon both sidesremember that basically they were justlike bread loaf and then you saw theDonkin it was just this tighter-fittingshoe and i think this was kind of likegame changing for me I was like I I likelooking at tape or tricks in these shoeson my feet[Music]more like choosing your bag pack thatyou chillin after your skating I didthat for years now looks like these aremy shoes in my skate shoes I don't haveany other shoes[Music]initially got a call from Robbie and hetold me that night he was startingskateboarding and they were startingwith the dot but Nike had tried to do atthe time was it called a choke or achode or something like thatcode I mean I had I had trepidation satdown with them

seeing what the junk did for retailto me is crazy it changed the wholescope of off gate job none of this wouldhave been possible without a sneakerculture scene that was you knowperforming in Los Angeles and the majorcities at the time once SP happen likethat was the game changer because ittook all the focus on the dogyeah the shot member shop owners wouldjust be trippin they did not have a clueof what him yeah you know there's linesin front of my store they're like andthen kids would just feel like you knowthis jonesing for the new you know leashfor Don I opened up in 2002 we openedthe store with some of the original sp1kids found out we had them and we wouldjust get calls and we get kids likeknocking on the door asking for them andwe were just like you know we didn'tknow with expect we are we are brand newretailers Brenda this business and umyou could tell there was a demand theskaters are buying them and thesneakerheads providing so it was thislike for a store it was like a doublewhammy people in LA wanted what theycouldn't get Nike SB came in I meanthat's when the craze started so thenthey killed you what the colors you knowlikethe Michigan dunk the Syracuse onBaltimore Chicago had it done New YorkCounty dunkI think LA even had it done no weren'treally skating on kids were walking homeyou know wasn't data is coming in withkids in the hood kids who

another level peoplewas lining up for 24 hours to get themit was in the middle of winter it'sfreezing and they were sleeping in liketents cardboard boxes however they cankeep keep warm and you know I I was witha bunch of friends we kicked it ended upgetting our pairs you know we got up andwe went and skated that was our thingslike these dudes came camped out andwaited in line and that was their thingI mean it's pretty chaotic you know Iremember one when one head came in andhe was like a 9 or a 10 and he had a 12however you remember this and he hadstuff socks in his shoes those aremoments that you're just like alrightman like it's your thing I remembergetting the pigeon dung here I had noclue they were I no clue they were soexpensive you know so I was like oh coolmellow color shoe you

myshoes I was like please but he didn'tlikehe got angry at me for like ruining theshoes that I got home and I look on theinternet here they they went for for alot of money I no cluethere's guys who just generally lovesneakers I love sneakers I've beenbuying sneakers all my life I have about1300 pairs of shoes in my closet andactually not my closet my my living roomon my dining room that I turned into mySteven closetabsolutely Tokyo is really the city thatthe real deal original sneaker headswere you know that's where they camefrom in the 80s 90s and a 2000 no onewas at hard core the guys out in TokyoJapan especially on your first trip it'scrazy it's like street wear on cracksneakers teachers and that the friendsnever heard of the colorways you neversaw before Tokyo has this brought wholechapter owned by this gentleman namedhomeo and real fog homeo is like one ofmy idols you know a lot of peopleprobably don't even know who this guy isbut he is definitely the first guy inthe world to have shops without make theaccounts without any kind of accountwell but he was just buying everythingfrom all over the world cuz it was aregional situationso whenever you'd open up a Japanesemagazine he's the reason why you seeevery single thing was available ontheir wall so that was just like a dreamlike for a guy like me you know okayyou're my name is a home yo like I I'mdoing to the Seneca business here aremore than years 20 years you knowclinical culture if you leading theattitude interesting advance in businessfees you know yeah you can feed you knowyeah we have the yeah lots of it youknow like I chose to the last of thedancing the sixth time or seven timesthree ever years you know I'm going tothe USyou know sometimes go to the adeno HongKong Philippines you know like policingwith a shirt but in keeping a nicecheery access to the grocery signal theywere sent out like soldiers to like goto every foot action and they newrelease dates to you the colorways theyknew it all so yeah a difference in mypassion Tina in order to get ala nabinalike a ditch bug yeah we cannot find tovery well you know yeah just trying toclear dinner yeah my memories you knowokayI was introduced to call me on and wesat down and he just told me what he wasdoing traveling the world is buyingeverybody's inventoryas you always have this regional forwardwe're like Japan Paris London would haveits own set of gates right theretherefore done but the main thing thatwas like agreed on Perales they neededto be skateboard specific something thatstill setting apart from just being anicer shoes came up with this chick footchallenges just like a you can keep thisoutside in your new shoes and give you afiber back the original ones had a mapof the store and the route to south whenthe slam dunk came out kind of blew mymind a little bit as well that's reallycool that's really cool like realizingthat skating in London can go furtherinto the world[Music]it was really like when the thunkstarted you know getting special youknow when people started working on themcreating special colorways that's reallywhat what kicked it off for what SP istoday I think you know I sort of proudof being there at that time right at thebeginning and you look now every majorfashion house has a sneaker the idea waslike let's just do something whichnobody would expect this buck with allthe materials we possibly can and let'sdo a pink sneaker and make it kind ofquite you know quite garish in many waysand I suppose you know this is thesneaker what's interesting is you've gotyou know you've got so many differentfabrics going on you've got your kind ofleather you've got your suede you've gotyour laminate kind of style you've got alot going on with the production hereand then also with the record that wascoming out was never Neverland which wasthe second uncle record and who werethese new characters so there's likepicture a characters printed it waspretty it was quite a bold statement atthe time and then it became the Dunkelwhich I don't even know I don't evenknow who came up with that title I'vegot a feeling it was just I don't knowif him who came up with it whoever didit was a great title but it was just akind of in the mid weird way it was akind of joke I think it was like youknow you something uncle dunk it dunk oryou know[Music]like the artists that we're doing the SBwe're sick and that that just opens likestreet art and like the culture and likejust seeing everything what they did youknow kind of changed my life to likewhat I'm doing now I started a brandbased on everything I you know didn'tlike about three where there's nothingto do in Vegas so I would just be on theinternet all day and so I just liketrolled the and nike talks learningabout just like the street culture youknow street art street where what's fromNike talking that message board still tothis day I don't care about anything butlike I think people got jobs and createda whole new industry and you brands justfrom that message board and I think it'sjust because of that shoe like a shoecan just change the life you know flythem in this car it's late yet a Dougmeans everything once I first got a Nikethat was like all I skated especiallythe lows I've never skated highs of meever in my life what a me want to skatedown to his Lewis more nail man miss mydog he just made him look so good

missdon't just like all-natural shoes beenaround forever it won't ever go nowhereand now I know you collect dunks you cansell them probably for like eBay for acouple grand it's just tricky to seethat but uh Chanel I know but I don'treally collect no dunks whatever I getus skated for the most part besides myJordan that's probably like the onlything I do say dance not doing for thecops I know the duck came out it waswith the times and everything but youknow when those dunk elite projects camealong and they're wanting to slim itdown you know make it a little moremodern I guess a little more sleek I wasreally excited these shoes you know whenyou slim shoes down I feel like you havemore control over what you want to doand it's done with school pretty much it[Music]little buck articleoh yeah I haven't seen these yet this isthe first time to be there pretty takethe big differential is a very very hugedifferential is that a skateboarder willmost likely get them and skate themsneak your

so you saw the thumbnail you read thetitle you already know what it is we gotthe nike sbdunklow supreme hyper royal and oh mygoshi cannot wait to talk about these solet's go ahead and get into the video[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how youbeing if you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit that subscribe button don't forgetto hit the bell notification for everytime i upload a new videoand make sure you hit that like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm oh somuch so as we know there has been a lotof hype leading up to this sneakersreleaseand oh man i took a l2 but it's okaybecause i borrowed a blue pair from ahomie so i can make this video for youguys and show you guys an in-depthreview of the sneakerand let you guys see what your opinionsare about it as well looking at the boxyou have your newer style purple nike sbbox with the flip open lid it reads nikesb dunk lowog quick strike white hyper royalmetallic goldretail 110 bucks flipping open the lidyou haveall over print nike sb and supreme paperand then we got the shoeoh we got the shoe okay firstimpressions of this shoebro these actually aren't that bad ithought they looked worse onlinebut they look a lot better in person sobefore we dive into the styles cuts andmaterials and everything like that youknow we got to kick some history firstjust to understand how this shoe got towhere it is today and why they came upwith this colorway and all the designsbehind it as we know supreme has beenaround for over 20 years nowand they have done dope collaborationswith nike throughout those years as wellback in 2002 nike sband supreme had a collab and they madetheir first ever nike sbdunk lows we had the black elephantprint colorway and the white and royalelephant print colorwayfollowing after that in 2003 we then sawthe nike sbdunk high and as you can see right herethe three colorways that came out backthenobviously they are not the same as theones from now but they're givingus a low top twist with the stars andeverything and they are switching outthe colors a little bitbut you get the inspiration from the ogcoming to the new low top version oftoday and i can't forget to mention the2012 red elephant print nike sbdunk low me personally that is myfavorite one of all of thesei really want to get those in mycollection but the price just keepsgoing upand i'm just not trying to pay that andwhile we're talking about nike sbdunk lows we can't forget to mention thejewel pack that came out in 2019you had three colorways from that packas well those didn't hit too welli don't think they're really that dopebut again to each his ownthat's just my personal opinion so nowin 2020 we have four different colorwaysthat recently released over the pastweekand obviously i can only show you thisone because it's the only one i got ahand if i can get the other ones i willbut i'm gonna pop up some photos righthere for you guys to check out the othercolorways that released as wellyou have the mean green the bark woodbrown the black and whiteand the hyper royal out of those fourcolor ways which one is your favoritei'm kind of digging this one bro i don'tknow if it's because it's cool colors orsomethingbut this royal blue is kind of clean sonow that you guys got a short gist ofhow this shoe came about and theinspiration from the ones in the pastlet's go ahead and break the shoe downstarting with the outsole you have yourclassic nike sboutsole murdered out in royal blueworking our way up to the midsole youhave all white with the white stitchand then the upper all the upper this isgonna be a good onethe look of the crocodile is cool butthe feel of itis not so cool i've definitely heard alot of people say this shoe looks likeit's poorly madeand made pretty cheap and i can say fromthe feelit kind of does feel that way i'vedefinitely seen better sbs with nicerqualitybut again to each his own and somepeople may like it just because it'ssupreme or the hype or whatever it maybebut i'm telling you right now mypersonal opinion i don't think these arethe best when it comes to quality butthe overallaesthetic in the look of the sneaker i'mnot mad at it and this is definitely asneaker i would like to have in mycollectioni think it would look dope on foot andnice with a cool little fit so besidesfrom the blue and the white on the upperas you can see on the mid panel here onthe outside and on the inside of thefootyou have gold stars all throughout thesneaker similar to the high topversion that we saw in the past this issomething that i've also heard a lot ofmixed opinions about and i've seenplenty of memesabout how people saying they're gonnabuy a regular gr nike dunk lowand then they're gonna get the littlestickers off of amazon and then put themon the shoei don't think anybody's gonna actuallydo it but if they do i would like to seehim do itone thing that i really do like aboutthe gold hits on this sneaker isthe gold on the tongue the gold on theback and the gold here on the fronti think those are some nice accents tothe shoe looking at the tongue you havean all-white puffy mesh tonguea set of black laces an additional setof royal blue laces or hyper royal lacesgoing to the sockliner you have a hyperroyal sockliner and then the insolesright here also read out supreme whenyou put both shoes togetheryou can see supreme throughout the shoeon the insoles so that's always a dopehit and i like seeing little toucheslike that on the sneakers these alsocome with an additional world famoussupreme hang tagwe have seen this on previous releasesfrom the past and i always love thislittle hang tag this little keychain idefinitely see a lot of peopleaccessorizing with this and i wouldn'tmind having it either but overall it'spretty simple pretty basic when it comesto color blocking and style of thesneakeri don't think the materials on thecrocodile on the royal part is somethingto rave about so i don't think there'stoo much to say about thatyou can see from the in hand looks onhow the shoe looks based on youropinions you could let me know how youfeel about the materials down belowbut i think overall design aestheticcolorway and everything like thati'm not mad at the shoe again i don'tthink this is the best sbever but i definitely would appreciatehaving this shoe in my collection so nowthat you guys know how i feel about theshoelet's take it to instagram and see whatthe polls say on there if you haven'talready make sure you follow me on ig soyou can participate in the polls andthen you'll see the results here on thechannelevery time i upload a new video 82percent of the people chose fireand 18 of the people chose trash and ican completely understand those resultsit all makes sense there's a lot of hypeand demand behind supreme the brandaloneit's a pretty solid shoe the pack ispretty dope i've seen worse from supremeand now they're worth a thousand dollarsso you got to look at that aspect likepeople's just gonna want it just becauseof hype reasons or resell or whatever itmay beso i can completely understand that ifyou could buy a shoe for a hundred andten dollarsand then sell it for a thousand dollarsi'm pretty sure a lot of people willwant to do that as well so when it comesto the release on the supreme websitehow was your experience did you even trydid you go for it how did it go did iterror out did you get the shoe was it incart and it didn't processlet me know how your experience wentdown below i personallywoke up and i was thinking about it i'mlike bro this is not about to work likei literally just looked at my appi tried to refresh it and then it justwas like loadingand then it loaded and it was like blankscreen and then it just said sold outand i was likethis is why i don't try on the suprememap because it's always something randomlike that soi knew i was already gonna take a l onthis sneaker and i was probably gonnahave to pay resale down the line if iwanted to get it so i definitely have anumber that i'm willing to spend on thisshoe or to get a different pair from thecollection or whateverbut i'm just not paying the full resalevalue because i know damn wellit's just not worth it to me but i meanagain we could say it could be worth itbecause as we knowfrom the past other supreme releasesthey could be worth a thousand dollarsnowand be worth four thousand dollars in acouple years or five years or somethingsoit's all relative to time opportunitycost you name it we can all takedifferent perspectives on how you wantto value this sneaker and differentstuff like that solet me know what you guys think downbelow in the comment section

hi and welcome to the running channeli'm andy and i'm anna and today we aregoing to berounding up some of the bestcarbon-plated running shoesyeah don't worry if you don't know whata carbon plate shoe is or what it's forwe're going to be taking you throughwhy some shoes have carbon plates whatstarted the trend in the first place andultimately and most importantlygiving you a roundup of some of the verybest shoes in this category on themarket right nowand stay tuned to the end too becauseandy and i will be pickingour favorites from all of the ones thatwe're going to show youfirst off though please do hit subscribeand tap the bell icon so you getnotified when we upload new videosall about running which we do every weekit really helps uscontinue with what we're doing rightlet's get stuck inbefore we talk about the specific shoeswe thought we'd really quickly take youthrough what carbon plate running shoesareand why they've become such a popularchoice for lots of runners this allstarted with nike's vaporfly 4shoes in 2017 and as the name suggeststhey claim to give you a four percentimprovement on your performanceand that was down to the spatula shapedcarbon fiber plate that ran through themidsole alongwith nike's zoom x foam sothe reason why carbon fiber was selectedas the material was becauseit gives you a bit of a propulsioneffect thereforegiving you a little bit more speed goingforwards from the nike vapor fly fourpercentthen came the nike vapor fly nextpercent which promised even moreimprovement for runnersultimately that's also been followed bythe nike alpha fly next percent whichwas based on the prototype shoe thateliotwore when he broke two hours for themarathon distance back in 2019.so we know that these shoes can make youfaster we even did our own experiment onthe running channel with ourvideographer tomto see how much faster he could run a 5kin thenike next percents to find out theanswer to that make sure you watchthe video but what is it that's behindthis extra speed well this is wherethere's some debatenike released a study which seemed toshow that it might be the carbon plateitself that was behind a kind ofspringboard effectthat might be responsible for theincreased speed but there's a lot ofspeculation about whether actually thefoam itself is more importantbut in some combination the special newfoam the high stack height alongside thecarbon plateprovides an improvement in runningeconomy energy return and ultimatelyperformance there's been concerns aboutthese new innovations and technologythroughout the elite running world andso newworld athletics rules state that forroad races shoesmust have a maximum stack height of 40millimetersfor track events it's between 20 and 25millimeters and that depends on thedistancebut across all shoes they must onlycontainone carbon fibre plate these rules werebrought in by world athletics topreserve the integrity of competitionbecause in many parts people wereworried about the fact that the newinnovations were placing more of anemphasison the conversation about shoes thanthey were on the athletes themselvesparticularly when you think about alevel playing field at an elite levelwhere athletes are sponsored bydifferent shoe brands and whether or notthey have access to the same sorts oftechnologyso even though there's been a lot ofdebate around carbon plates in shoes alot of brands have followed nike's leadand some are even ontheir second iteration of these shoes solet's take a look at some of ourfavorites out thereand put them to the testthis is the asics meta racer and it'sprobably the most recognizable as aracing flat or traditional road racingshoefor those of us that are more used totraditional looking shoesso if you are looking for something witha lower stack kite that can perhaps feelmore responsivemore aggressive and give you morefeeling that you're closer to the roadthen this could be something worthconsidering now there's no doubt thatthe combination of new foam technologyand carbon plates does provide aperformance boost but a lot of the highstack shoes one of the things that theyhave in commonis that they can feel a little bitunstable when you wear them for thefirst time and actually take a littlebit of getting used tothat's not the case here with the lowerstack kite on offerin fact putting them on they immediatelyfelt familiar definitely fastbut familiar and if you do have a gatethat becomes increasingly less efficientas you get more fatigued over the courseof a longer event particularly like themarathon like a lot of us do whereyour knees might start to roll in alittle bit more or you might pronatemore excessively at the anklethen the extra stability that's affordedby the lower stack height might besomething that's a real benefit to youwith a lot of discussion about thecontribution of the new foam technologyto the overall performance there's nodenying that because there's a lowerstack height there's less foam in thisshoeand in fact recently an asic sponsoredathlete sarah hallran in a development shoe at the londonmarathon it looked a lot like the metaracer but it had a significantly visiblyhigher stack height so actually thatcould be an indicationof the future from asics maybe one towatch out for it could also be seen asan admission of what's requiredto really compete at the highest levelwith those shoes with the highest stackheightspersonally i really enjoyed running inthese shoes they felt familiar straightout of the boxand they felt fast across a whole rangeof different activities soright from almost maximum pace runningstrides all the way through to longerintervalsthey felt responsive they felt quick butin a different way to some of the otherson testdefinitely less bouncy but for thatperhaps more controlledthis is the on cloud boom so with astack height of20 millimeters it's nowhere near as highas the nikevapour flies for example it's anincrediblylightweight shoe so this one actuallyprice wise comes in a little bit cheaperthan some of the other carbon plateshoes that are out there on the marketat the moment when testing this shoe formeit felt like one to be used over shorterdistances maybe fast5ks or 10ks but anything above that iwould probably struggle because it'sincredibly firm shoesize wise i found that the on cloud boomdid come upvery very narrow in fact i've had totake the lacesout of a couple of the eyelets therejust to give my foot a little bit extraspace technology wise what honor donehere is they've used their cloud techtechnology so you can see along the solehereyou've got alternating gaps in betweento give you a bit more of a cushionedride that said it is stillincredibly firm and the carbonplate within this one is a carboninfusedspeed board which you can see along thesidesof the midsole and you've got the speedboard in the bottom there as wellso if you're looking for a fast shorterdistance shoethen the on cloud boom could be the onefor youthis is the new balance fuel cell rcelite and for methis is the shoe that feels the closestwhen you put it on to running in thenike vapor flight next percentit feels bouncy and there is a feelingof it immediately propelling you forwardon contact right through to toe offthere are some differences thoughultimately it's the combination of theway that the carbon plateand the foam work together to providethe feeling when you're out thererunningand for me that manifested itself ashaving a very distinct sweet spot wherethey felt the bestand for me that was between my thresholdpace and my 10k pace where they did feelfantastic and like they were a real gamechanger in the way i was able to runthey felt good at maximum pace too buti'd say less revolutionary for meso it'd be interesting to see whetherdifferent people with differentmechanicswould find that their sweet spot forthese was at a different pace i reallylike the degree of grip that i felt thatthe outsole gave mesome of the other shoes on test havesacrificed the outsole to save weightbut that didn't really feel like thecase here they fit nice and securelythere isn't a gusseted tongue but ididn't have any problems with it movingaroundthe very nature of all of the shoetechnology that's under discussion atthe moment means that it's quite likelythat there will be non-responders andrespondersand that might differ from brand tobrand and shoe to shoe things likeweightbiomechanics foot shape and the way thatyou run are all going to have an impacton whether you find that particular shoeis effective for youultimately for me the shape of the shoein combination with the distribution ofthe foam technology in the midsoleled to a really natural foot movementwith a small degree of pronationowing to the fact that there is morefoam on the outside compared tounderneath the arch that small degree ofpronation is great because controlpronation is what leads to fast runningbut if that pronation becomes toopronounced as you fatigueor uncontrolled then that's what canlead to injury or inefficiencyso for me i'd want to be sure that i hadconfidence in my nice neutral footmovement to maximize the benefit i wouldget from wearing the rc elitethis is the brooks hyperion elite iiso the second iteration of a carbonplate shoe from brooksthe upgrade from the original makes itfeellike a much more stable ride some of theshoestested for this video i personally foundlike there wasn't an awful lot ofsupport in the ankle and that comes downto the factthat they are incredibly light shoes andthey're just not built to supportsso you do sometimes feel like you'regoing to go over on your anklewhat i would say with the brooks one isthat actually this felt the most stableout of the ones that i've personallytested for this videoso the hyperion elite comes up as prettytrue to sizeif anything i do have a bit of a widerfoot so the toe box did feel a little onthe narrow side but nothing toouncomfortable at all and in fact it feltlike it just hugged my footand gave me a bit of support like i saidpreviouslyso the hyperion elite price wise isa little on the expensive end of thescale so it's not the cheapestout there and i would say that you doget your money's worth with the shoe butyou are going to have to be willing topart with a little bit of extra cashin order to purchase the hyperion elite2. the hyperion elite 2 has a stackheight of 37millimeters so much higher than thecloud boom for example and getting closeto the nike vapor flyand that limit from world athletics of40 millimetersoverall a really stable reallycomfortable ride and it definitely mademe feelpretty fast with that rocking propellingmotionwith that carbon plate so if you'rewilling to spend a little bit of extramoney then the brooks hyperion elite twois a good shoethis is the hoka one a rocket x andactually the irony here for me is thathoka have often made a bit of a splashfor their shoes looking quite differenti'm thinking the 10 9and the clifton edge for example butwith the rocket x these are actuallyprobably the most normal looking shoesi've been sent by hokaand that's in a category wherecompetitor shoes are actually lookingincreasingly differentand whilst the shoes in this categoryare eye-wateringly expensiveactually the rocket x is by far thecheapest on testit's not a cheap shoe but it is cheaperand i've been excited to test this eversince i saw alephine tuliamoktake victory in the u.s olympic marathontrials wearing these shoes in a nikedominated fieldi've previously found hocus shoes to bequite narrow but i thought that thesewere a little bit more generousthey have a gusseted tongue whichprovides a really nice fit andultimately the high stack height andload dropwon't be a surprise to any hoka fans outthere the sole gave good gripon the road but it didn't feel quite sosure-footed on wet road as some of thecompetitor shoesin fact you'll see that the coverage ofthe outsole is relatively minimal whichis probably what's responsible for thatwhether or not it's the lower drop thatdoesn't allow for the same degree ofmechanicalassistance i did find that these left mefeeling a little bit moreflat footed than some of the others andprovided less of a degree of propulsionfrom foot contactto toe off so they're a great option ifyou're used to low dropshoes and you're looking for somethinglight and responsivebut they definitely feel lessrevolutionary than some of the otherbrands interpretationsthey're also less bouncy and cushioned iactually really enjoyed running withthem for methe lower cushioning actually gave me abetter feel for the road which i enjoyedand i think their pedigree has beenproven by that success in the olympicmarathon trials that i mentionedbut i do think that overall these aregoing to be a shoe that are a positivefor some people but other people mightnot get on withthis is the adidas adi zero adios proeasy for you to say not quite so easy torememberi always managed to get this one wronganyway thisshoe is adidas's carbon plateshoe and it has a carbon plate in theheel and carbonrods through it too at 225 grams this isactually the heaviestshoe on test and you can tell whenholding it that it hasgot quite a bit of weight to it on thesolerunning in it though they do feelincredibly lightweight incredibly fastthe upper on them is like a meshand it feels like you're not reallywearing shoes at all you've just gotsoles strapped to the bottom of yourfeetthe rocking motion from this shoe reallyreally felt like i was being propelledforward from the minute i put them on soeven justwalking in these shoes not even runningit felt like you really wanted to get onyour toes and goso i found that this shoe was incrediblycomfortable the fit was perfect for mewidth wise and size wisei'm a uk six and a half and it came uptrue to sizewhat i was saying about ankles earlierthisshoe because of the really low profilearound the ankleit did feel to me at times that therewas no support or stability there so ifyou are prone to rolling on your anklesthen maybe consider that if you'relooking at the adidasadios adizero prothe sole on this one was what struck mefirst about itstraight out of the box it's incrediblysmooth so i've runin this shoe in the wet and i was reallyconcerned about the traction on thegroundespecially if you're taking fast cornersfor exampleso far i haven't had a problem with thatbut it is worth noting because i havefound inother shoes that have got incrediblysmooth solesthat obviously the grip just isn't therein wetter conditionsalso the colorway let's just talk abouthow beautiful this shoe looksi am a sucker for a pretty shoe and ireallylove what adidas have done with this oneso overall the adidas shoe isup there with one of my favorites but ido thinkthat i would have some concerns abouthow longthey'll last you with this sole ihaven't done enough miles in them yet tobe able to give youa good rough estimate of how long theywould lastbut a beautiful shoe a comfortable shoeand one that definitely made me feelfasternow that we've taken you through a lotof different options it's time for us tolet you know our personal favorites andwhere we'd put our money if we wanted tomaximize our return in terms of runningperformancenow for me i'm a bit of a traditionalistand so i really enjoyed the familiarityof putting onthe meta racer but ultimately if it wasmy money i would probably put it intothe new balancerc elite i felt like they gave me themostimmediate return although it's hard tosay whether that's better than the nikevapor flynext percent ultimately there's so muchdata behind that and so many results outtherethat it's pretty hard to get away fromjust how successful that shoe's beenso my favorite shoe well i do run innike's anawful lot so the vapor fly is thereat the top for me but picking one of thealternatives for this videoit's gonna have to be the adidas adizeroadios proi love the look of the shoe i love thefeel of the shoe i lovehow fast it makes me feel and i lovefeeling the propulsion even when walkingin this shoewhen you put it on it feels incrediblyspecial and when you're going to bespending a lot of money onthese carbon plated shoes you wantsomething that is being kept for bestkept for races something that is goingto make you feel goodas well as helping you run that littlebit fasterand i did feel like these shoes did makeme feel a bit faster so what do youthink about carbon plate running shoesand all of the new technologywould you fork out for a pair or haveyou done so already let us know in thecomments below we'd love to hear fromyouand we'll see you next

no problem communicative oh those aretough what's your vibrator hatzor noteven out yet whoa is that welcome backwhat's insideI went in this van today we're gonna cutopen some acne airmaxno nothing I hear right I remember howmuch you guys all freaked out when wecould open Yeezys a while back and eventhe LED shoes but to be specific we'vegot the vapor max they don't come outuntil March 26 they did a limitedrelease in Paris and somebody was crazyenough to sell one of their pairs and Igot it it has the most air of any nikeair back and it also took be engineeredat 95 years to make efficient they hadto go through so many differentiterations because every time theychanged one little air pocket it wouldhave an impact on it and so they had totesting things out with 350 runners theruns combined and testing this thing isequivalent to somebody running aroundthe earth five different times the lastweek of our lives have been insane I'mstill recovering from jet lag we wantedto understand the story of the Nikeshoes not just to tell you but to showyou a little bit where the inspirationof these shoes and of this bubble camefrom we went to bears we went to Paristhe reason why we came to Paris for alittle inspiration is because thisbuilding behind us is the Pompidoumuseum do you see those the escalatornow how it has glass that goes throughit look at this shoe through the air in1987 the first Air Max ones came out andit was the first shoe that ever had thislittle bubble in it and it was inspiredby Tinker Hatfield of Nike he came andsaw this museum any thought I want to dothat in a shoe let's make the inside tobe on the outside just like thiscontroversial building tink you'realmost got fired for it but it ended upsaving Nike and making Nike this bigglobal company that is today there'sbirds everywhere what's going to makethis video kind of cool at least I thinkis we are going to cut open the air maxzeros so we get to see the very veryfirst pioneer shoe of this Air Maxseries and then we also get to see themost advanced running shoe of the Ermacseries on onewhen I was a Nike I got to go andcustomize and in Zion kind of my ownvery shoe it was the nike air mushroomsI think all the colors all dimensionalyou guys need to go to Nike and go andvote for my shoes will run shoot we didgo to Paris but then a few days later wewent to the Nike headquarters andLincoln sat down with Tinker Hatfieldand asked them a question about whatshould link and be inspired by on theshoe that he created big and easy way tosort of describe how you might go aboutdoing this would be what do you loveallocate for your beautyI like me okay so if you go down thatsort of like the unlit things that areimportant to you you can end up at somepoint to go you know what I could beinspired by the gold people every goalto be bridgeso maybe my shoe is going to be toocolorable and maybe it'll havelines eyes that's that that are betterlook like all the pupils and hold up therich part missions will drive on youknow means that you always look forsomething that is interesting computerto yourself because it might be they'llprobably be interested other people aswell so I thought about what I said alot and I decided something that's likeI loved it meaningful to me is a Teslaand the cool thing is to is Lincolnstuff to show is designed to TinkerHatfield demand himself and got histhoughts on it you can see how theinspiration came from Lincoln I taking atrip to Paris all the way through to thefinal day when Lincoln designs this shoesay to another family channel subscribeto that if you haven't already every dayfor the next five days we will have anew video showing our trip and Italy andwhat about Cuddy she's open what kind ofopen so let's go if we are in a fancyworkshop of our awesome next-doorneighbor that we did the owl pelletvideo with more fancies in our set thisyear the last time we got one of thesesaws was when we could open the easiesand I left the shoelaces on and Igrabbed the blade and it broke the sawand I just threw the thing away soLincoln shoelaces[Music]there we go we have to choose we'regoing to leave the paper in them now hownew these are they still have the paperit upsafety first thanks for my neighbors forthe awesome safety glasses they alsolike this anymoremr. cool[Music]I gotta get me one of these sighs thatwas amazingokay we're not going to look at it yetwe want to cut the other one and we willkeep them closed to take them home forinspection[Music][Music][Music]there they arelet's set them down first a lot old onyour pocket here you gohere you go guys here is the air max0doesn't look awesomeI don't maybe it looks really lame Iknow we have a girl yet there's noleaking you can look at what ain't wegonna weigh whoa look at that air pocketit's like there's there's another oneback thereis there another one or maybe we justcut right through the bubble looks likethey have one in the middle one of thelittle shock pipe supports or pillars inthe middle note so it looks like there'sanother pocket but it's really all justone try smelling it I think I got purplethat she would make don't smell cut upand shoot the paper will actually looksuper cool this is actually cool how allthose different reduced on the bottom ofthe shoe I like that a lotyeah it does look cool when we were withNike they did tell us and we cut a shoeopen they told us that they actually cutopen a lot of their shoes but it'sactually super helpful for them to cutit open and just take a look and see howall the different layers and how of howit's designed look so one question Ihave to them is what's inside of the huelike what is this Imperial in there isit really just air they says theycouldn't tell me what it is but it is aproprietary gas pipe mix the most airever in a Nike Air shoe dickermax lotsof paper max here we go take that a jokethank you so much a lot of gold yeah sothis really is just air pocket yeah doesnot for resale property of Nike AHA notproperty of Nike anymore we own thisvapor Max and weakever since the airmax was created at 87they've been making these air pockets inthe USA they make them in Oregon andthen they ship them to wherever theyactually manufacture the shoe and thenput them in but what's reallyinteresting is a in 2015 they spentforty point five million dollars tobuild a plant that manufactures everyone of these souls and then in theUnited States it's in Portland weactually have the souls yeah check itout awesome so the front is separatefrom the back they just put those onseparately so you can run and offendhereokay these are they give up but in theworld I ever look in this bag so nowhere is the shoe not for resale this ishow they make the shoes I think it'scalled Flyknit where they make wemanufacture it all together in one shoecomponent and then they just turn itdown and they connect it around the sizeof this and then they put the insoleinto it do that layer right there that'sa layer that they usually will will havethat layer on the shoe and then theyglue on the sole well with this one theydon't glue on a sole which makes it sothat she was lighter for runners andthen it makes them even more so likewalking on air so when we cut throughthe vapor max with the saw as soon asthey hit the front it made a laptoplet's try it with a knife and see whatit does well I tried pretty hard and itdidn't pop it okay try again durabilitytest those are tough what's the heck dothey make that out of what the heck isright this way right oh this is a sharpknife yeah that's sureyou got a lot of you guys that arewatching this video are probably likesneakerheads and you know all aboutthese Nike Air Max is you know a shoeswe didn't we're just a normal person andwhat did we learn from it there's a lotthat goes into manufacturing the shoeyou can go on to our family channelwe're going to have five differentvideos of it it was a really cooladventure Lincoln raced against a goldmedal at the Olympic

"in the early 1970s Nike was stillstruggling to find a voice in the thenrising basketball shoe market the brandwas less than a decade old CarolynDavidson a graphic design student waspaid $35 to design the famous swooshlogo and the company had just switchedtheir name from Blue Ribbon sports toNike in 1973 just two years after thename changeNike took the famous swoosh logo andthrew it on a plain white shoe creatinga sneaker that was so simple in designyou couldn't miss the iconic logo theNike blazer a sneaker that has stood thetest of timedespite technological advancements inmodern Footwear in this video we'regoing to be combing Nikes history to tryand understand how this 46 year old shoeis still relevant today but hey if thisis your first time tuning into thischannel my name is Brianmy brother nacho and I make videos onsneaker history and all things relatedto sneaker culture so if you're intothat kind of thing please considersubscribing let's get into the videothis is a plimsoll this is one of theearliest examples of a rubber soledathletic shoe you see before the 1960sand 70s not much thought beyond this wasgiven to a sneaker designed forathletics while converse did mix thingsup with the all-star Chuck Taylors in1917 it wouldn't be until much muchlater that real thought would be givento his shoe designed specifically forathletes so when the Nike blazerreleased in 1973 the shoe featured aleather uppera mesh nylon tongue and a texturedvulcanized rubber sole that preferredsole for basketball sneakers in theearly 1970s in fact at the time each ofthese elements were the besttechnologies available for shoes on thecourt it was the cutting-edge technologyat the time even after the debut of theBlazer it would still be five yearsbefore Nike first injected air into itssoles with the Nike toe one and twelveyears before they signed Michael Jordanto be the front man of its basketballbusiness Nike as we know today did notexist but the blazer is an icon fromthat era when deciding on a suitablename for the silhouette Bill Bowermanand Phil Knight took inspiration fromthe local basketball team the PortlandBlazers but Nike looked a Texas SanAntonio for brand awareness it wasGeorge the Iceman Gervinof the San Antonio Spurs who would bethe first basketball player to endorsethe shoe here's what girlfriend had tosay about his relationship with Nikeback then Nike was very innovative Nikewas thinking out of the box back in the70s when I first joined the NBA I usedto wear adidas and the Nike came onboard and Nike approached me and wantedto give me much more money and they hada better quality shoe sponsoring GeorgeGervin was a well thought out strategicmove Nike was entering a new sector inthe sportswear market they had tocompete with Adidas and converse so it'sno wonder that they placed a giantswoosh on the side of the shoe to buildbrand awareness as for George the IcemanGervin he was one of the most notoriousplayers in the league was a nickname forhis cool attitude on the court and anincredible track record as a shootingguard the cameras were pointed at gurbinevery game and whenever those camerascaught his feet they found huge Nikesolutions every photograph was like anadvertisement and Nike was slowly butsurely building a reputation in thebasketball world let's talk about playerexclusives also commonly referred to bysneaker heads is PE player exclusivesare one-off colorways or renditions of ashoe created for basketball players bythe brand's they're sponsored but theyare frequently used to build hype aroundlimited releases test colorways orsimply a public expression of thebrand's commitment to the player asGeorge Gervin began to make a name forhimself as a legend on the courtNike naturally wanted to celebrate hisnickname the Ice Man fitting Gervin withthe unique blazer model this specialblazer model had Iceman across the heelwhere the word Nike usually sat you seeback in the 1970s player exclusives wereso rare that the gurbin blazer Pease mayhave very well been the first PE sneakerever made unfortunately the Iceman peasewere never released to the public but itserves as a symbol of howforward-thinking Nike was about fiveyears after the blazer was introducednike put all its efforts developingtheir nike air technology program itwouldn't be long before heavy leathersfragile meshes and hard vulcanizedrubber soles got left in the past injust a few short years the Blazer wasfar from the best of what Nike had tooffer and unfortunately the sneaker fellout of favor with basketball players bythe time the 1990s rolled around theNike blazer was officially xton the basketball court but the NikeBlazers soul that was once designed fortraction on hardwood basketball courtswas quickly adopted by skateboardersskaters chose the Nike blazer becausethe shoe sole had amazing traction ontheir skateboards grip tape and not tomention the heavy leather and suedeuppers were strong enough to withstandthe constant wear and tear from kickflips and Ollie's as basketball playersleft the Nike blazer behind skaters tookownership of the sneaker and it found asecond life that would ultimately savethe silhouette from ever going out ofstylein 2003 street artist Futura 2000 usedthe opportunity of a Nike collaborationto do something unique with the budgetsneaker the collab featured a blend ofolive tan and navy suede and they onlyreleased 1,000 pairs making themimmediately rare and collectible whileyes sure there was hype around therelease it didn't bring crazy awarenessto the shoe that would happen nextit wasn't until 2005 when the legendarypro skater Lance Mountain announced thedevelopment of the blazer for Nike SBfinally adding padding to the tongue andbringing nike air technology into thesneaker for the first time these minortweaks officially transform the shoefrom being a basketball shoe to skateshoe and one of the best skate shoes onthe market still to this day in 2006 theNike blazer got a massive boost when theiconic skate brand supreme collaboratedwith Nike on a trio of Blazers thiselevated the classic silhouette to oneof the most sought-after sneakers in theworld supreme released three wiltedblazers was Nike in black white and redeach colorway featured a fake snakeskinswoosh and Gucci inspired ribbons up theheels that held golden d-rings to thisday the 2006 supreme blazers areconsidered by many to be the high-watermark for brand collaborations and one ofthe best Nike collaborations supreme hasever made brand new pairs are rare tocome by and even use Paris fetch forfigure prices if you go on stock X rightnow you can find them going forthousands of dollars in recent years theBlazer has been a canvas for artists anddesigners like Hiroshi Fujiwara anoff-white

the year is 1987 and television sets allover the nation flash and sync to thepremiere of Full House The Simpsons maketheir first appearance on TV and theCold War is still in full effect anup-and-coming footwear brand by the nameof Nike was on the verge of collapsingto their competitors how were they goingto stand out from the bright pink andneon green colors that dominated fashionback then the answer my friends is theNike Air Max 1 the first Nike shoe toreveal the magic behind Nikes famous airtechnology welcome back to the channeleverybody if you're new here my name isBrian and my brother nacho and I makevideos on sneaker history and all thingsrelated to sneaker culture so if yoursneaker enthusiasts like we are then youmight want to consider subscribingbecause we drop videos like this on theregular and you won't want to miss anupload so with that out of the way guyslet's get into the video it seems likeevery other video we make we end uptalking about Tinker Hatfield if youdon't know already Tinker Hatfield wasone of the greatest if not the best andmost successful sneaker designers in theworld but did you know that he neveractually set out to be a Footweardesigner in fact back in 1981 Tinker wasoriginally hired by Nike as a corporatearchitect his job was designingshowrooms and offices for the rapidlygrowing company it wouldn't be untilseveral years later that Tinker Hatfieldwould be assigned the first shoe designproject of his career the Nike Air Maxone but before we get into that I wantto tell you about the Nike Air Max onespredecessor the Nike Air tailwind theAirtel one was the first shoe to useNikes now-famous air technology it cameout long before the Air Max one a lot ofpeople think the Air Max one was thefirst shoe to feature air but it's notit was in fact the Nike Air tailwindwhen it came out in 1978 it created alot of buzz for Nike and sold like crazyI'm not gonna spend too much time on thetail one since we already did anin-depth history video on the shoe so Isuggest you check that out at some pointif you're interested after the nike airtail wind came out Nikes air technologybecame the company's main focus alwaysthinking ahead Nike wanted to developthe technology to be lighter and moreeffective innovation was their topprioritythat's when Tinker Hatfield came induring this time thank you was trying toincrease the size of the air bagin their shoes to provide morecushioning the problem was all thepolyurethane used in the sole wouldn'tallow it the polyurethane is what coversair units from being exposed especiallynear the heel check out this clip from1986 of a young Tinker Hatfield with hisco-workers discussing this very exactissue we have finely designed a bag thatputs the largest amount of air into theshoes for cushioning but we offerwe've also widened a bag so that we'renot sacrificing stability at all wellthat's great but how are we gonna fit anair sole this wide into our mid solesyeah but why not just show it you knowit's not a bad idea to let peopleactually see what an air bag looks likeas a matter of fact I've got a drawinghere that actually shows what a Wes youcould look like with a visible windowand he'll tinkers inspiration for theshoe came about from a recent trip hetook to Paris where he saw thecontroversial Pompidou Center thisbuilding was designed by a committee ofarchitects that included Renzo Piano andRichard Rogers the architecturalstructure of the building broke newground in the 70s it's unique because itreveals all the inner workings of thebuilding and to this day still standsout among traditional Frencharchitecture the idea of turning adesign inside out intrigued a field andthat's where the suggestion to exposethe airbag in the air max1 came fromTinku was met with great opposition fromnike about his desire to expose the airunit and the design nearly cost him hisjobupon his release the Nike Air Max onefeatured a mesh and suede upper thatmade the shoes super lightweight anddurable at the same time of course themain feature of the shoe was thisunforgettableair window Nike was worried about peoplebeing hesitant to purchase the shoebecause they were afraid that customerswould think the air bubble would popeasily but that just wasn't the case theair bag was bigger and more robust thanever the shoe was a massive success therelease of the Nike Air Max one in 1987was a huge milestone for Nike not onlyin regards to the success of the shoebut more importantly to the overallimage and design direction for the brandmoving forward the varsity blue and redwas an odd choice during the late 80sanother interesting thing about thehistory of the Air Max one is thatTinker Hatfield initialfurther design was actually what we knowtoday as the air max zeroes if we goback to that clip of Tinker proposing todesign to his colleagues you'll noticeit's a yellow version of the air max onebut with a different looking upper backthen it was impossible to manufacturethe shoe due to its complex upper butthanks to modern day technology thisspecific shoe was actually released onair max day in 2016 since its release in1987 the Air Max one has been celebratedby sneaker heads and artists all aroundthe world there are so many collabs andcolorways to cover I wouldn't be doingit any justice trying to cram them intothis video just know that they exist andyou should check out some of the manyAir Max colorways that are available onMarch 26 every year since 2014 peoplecelebrate the shootnike declares this day air max day

so a lot of people hit me up asking methe question dj what's the differencebetween a nike duck and a nike dunk sbso today i'm going to be breaking downthe differences between these two shoesbecause i want to make sure that youhave an understandingon what shoe you're buying[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit the subscribe button hit the bellnotification for every time i upload anew videodon't forget to smash the like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm oh somuch so first things first i do want tolet you guys knowthese are not the only type of low topdunks that are made you have nike dunklow pro pro bsp co japan 6.0 there's a lot ofdifferent nike dunk lowsand i'm pretty sure there's more that ididn't list but i know these are the twomain hitterswhen it comes to people looking forsneakers and stuff that typically hitsretailsor skate shops that a lot of people arelooking to buy so i wanted to make surethat i broke these two down inparticularbecause they do have similar colorblocking obviously it's not exactly thesamebut we're not worried about colorblocking we're actually talking aboutthe cutsthe materials and the functionality ofthe two shoes and how they become sodifferent even though they may look thesame so the first thing we'll talk aboutis price the box and then we'll talkabout the shapes and molds of the shoewe'll talk about the insoles the sockliners the tongues the outsoles thelaces literallyeverything has something just a littlebit different and that's why i'm soexcited to show you these differencesso let's go ahead and get into it solooking at the box as you can see righthere for the regular nike dunk lowthis is going to be with the red box andthen the nike sbas you can see on the box it's thepurple box and it has the nike sb logoright herethe best thing about this is both ofthese are going to be around 100for retail so some people may getconfused on that aspect alonethinking hey they're both 100 buckswhat's the difference between the twoshoes so we know that there has been alot of hype around dunks because theyare very similar to air jordan onesit's always a classic model and you cannever go wrong with it especially to beable to purchase this shoe for 100 bucksand let's not even talk about resale butwe know that they're hitting right nowand it makes a lot of sense for peopleto be copping these so i definitely wantto make sure you guys know what you'regetting into so with typical fashionlike i always do with every sneakerreview we're gonna talk about theoutsole firstand as you can see right here there's ahuge difference between these outsolesone is configured for a nike sb outsoleand then your regular dunk here has aclassic og nike dunk outsole so when itcomes to skateboarding and the purposeof nike sbyou're going to want to have more gripmore traction different things like thatand this shoe is configured for thatreason so that's why you see thedifferences between this outsolethey did go with a similar vibe but asyou can see just from the lines righthere and the lines right here there's ahuge difference and that should be onebig telltale for you to understand thedifference between if it's a sb or notand if you look right here where thenike logo is you just have nikeand then if you look at the sb it saysnike sb right here that's another bigindicator to help you understand thedifference between the two now wrappingup to the midsole this is another thingthat really stands out and i don't knowif a lot of people do notice it or notbut if you look at the small lines righthere on the classic nike dunkas you can see the spacing between themright here and when we put them togetherside by sidethe lines go all the way up to the topwhere the white line is on the midsoleand if you look on the nike sb theyactually stop just shy of that line andthey all float just right underneaththatand also the spacing is a little bitdifferent right there so that's alsoanother easy way to tell the differencebetween the two shoes looking at themidsoles of the shoes they do look veryvery same to the visual eye so i can'tsay there's a huge difference betweenthoseyou got all white with the white stitchand obviously the color blocking willchange depending on the colorway of theshoe now when it comes to the cut of thesneakerit is slightly changed just a little bitas you can see this one's a lot morepuffy around the ankleand padded on the inside around the sockliner area and then obviously you have ahuge thickfat fat tongue and it says nike dunk lowpro and it's got the sv right hereand if you look on here it's just gotyour regular nike with the swooshbranding on the tongueit's thin with a mesh and then you havea thin sock liner and everything aroundherejust like a regular fit on a regularshoe so for me personally when i seesomebody walking from far far awayobviously i can't see the soul of theirsneaker but the tongue is a hugegiveaway because everybody knowsmost well i'm pretty sure all nike sb'scome with a real fat tongue and that's abig giveaway for a lot of people okayone other very important thing before iforget to mention because i almostforgot to mention itbut as you can see inside the shoe thereis no elastic band right herethat connects the tongue so as you cansee there's nothing right therebut on the nike sb you can see thatelastic band on the inside of the footright there so that's what's going tokeep your foot more locked in and notlet youlose your foot you know or shoe fall offwhen you're skateboarding or anythinglike that sothese are definitely going to keep youmore locked in but uh that's definitelya huge huge difference onfit and everything too so i almostforgot to mention that but we're goodbecause we got it now when you look atthe profile side of the shoe right hereyou can see there's not really majordifference but one thing that i do and ialways notice is on the nike sb there'sa flap right herethat flaps out around the eyelets andthe first two holes right here and ifyou look at the regular nike dunk theflap actually doesn't go over the topand it stopsunderneath this line right here and youcan see the difference between the twoshoes in that photo right there that ijust showed you looking at the toe capsof the shoes they are slightly differentbut i can say overall it's prettysimilar so i wouldn't say that's a bigdifference betweenoh this is sb or not i think the otherthings are huge telltales compared tothe toe cap and the perforation spotsand the placement and everything likethat i wouldn't say it's a problem butit's nothing really to worry about onthat aspect one cool thing that i loveabout dunks as well is they typicallycome with the extra pair of lacesbut as you can see right here you kindof got your rope laces right hereon the nike sb and it has an additionalpair of rope laces right here on thenike sbon the regular dunk you have a flat laceand then you have additional pair offlat laces as well so typically when yousee a fat lace on the dunkthat's going to be another telltale butsome people do like to switch it outand put those in their regular dunks aswell so i can't say that's an exactindicator but typically that's how itgoesokay so these right here these insolesthese are honestly some of the biggestdifferences as well when it comes tocomfortwhen it comes to a nike dunk low and thereason why i say that yes they look thesame on this sidebut if you flip it over right here asyou can see it has a zoom air unit onthe backhere for the nike sb and this is justlike a regular phylon midsolethat you would get in a regular old dunkso that addition right there with thistechnology added to the shoeas you can see the padding here on theball of the foot in here at the hill ofthe footbut they're both still a hundred dollarsi think the spdunk alone is a better deal simply forthat reason because now you'reincorporating comfort for that same 100okay so now it is time to see what thepeople think about this shoeif you haven't already make sure youfollow me on ig so you can participatein the polls that i post on theretypically i ask people questions andthen i share the results here on thechannelso today what i asked the people is notif the shoe is fire or trashbut simply which one do you like more doyou like the nike dunk model or do youlike the nike dunk sb model more andthis is what the people said66 of the people went with the nike sband 34 of the people went with the nikedunknow me personally i'm going with thenike dunk simply off wearabilityand functionality and this is just sucha classic modelthe nike sb was created around 2002. thenike dunk has been around for over 30years there would be no nike sb if therewas never no nike dunk so i always haveto pay homage and respect to the ogand i gotta give love to the nike dunklow also with me wearing a size 13the poofy tongue and everything likethat it looks really hugetoo bulky and sometimes just doesn't gowith every outfit and i definitely canpull off a lot more fits with theregular slim nike dunk glow but thisis somewhat of a loaded question becauseif you ask me when it comes to colorwaysi honestly like the nike sb series a lotmore for thatwith the creativity and thecollaborations that they do with thenike sb'sover the more simple color blockingstyles that we see with the regular nikedunk low so when it comes to dope lookappeal and everything like that i wouldpick the nike sbwhen it comes to functionality androcking the shoe all the time i wouldpick the nike dunk lowbut at the end of the day if i couldonly pick one i would go nike dunk lowover nike sb and i know that may not bethe popular choice but again that's myopinion now it's time for you to shareyoursdown below in the comment section sodon't forget to drop a comment and letme know what you think about the twoshoes which one of these do you likemore the nike dunk low or the sbstyle more let me know down below in thecomment section i do have a couple othercomparisonswith the high tops and

this is Paul Rodriguez Peapod was one ofthe first skaters to be sponsored byNike for years it was taboo for skatersto support Nike because it was theopposite of what skateboarding culturestood forif you skated in the early 2000s thenyou probably remember being shocked andmaybe even downright angry when Nike SBATS started popping up in skateboardmags like Thrasher and Transworldhow did this happen

this is Paul Rodriguez Peapod was one ofthe first skaters to be sponsored byNike for years it was taboo for skatersto support Nike because it was theopposite of what skateboarding culturestood forif you skated in the early 2000s thenyou probably remember being shocked andmaybe even downright angry when Nike SBATS started popping up in skateboardmags like Thrasher and Transworldhow did this happen why is thisrecognized as such a big cultural shiftby both the sneaker world and skateboardculture the truth is that during thisera skateboarding culture was hugelyimpacting sneaker sales skateboardingwas finally reaching the mainstreamafter decades of being an undergroundoutcast at subculture during this boomiconic brands like DC Shoes etniesAmerica ES and Osiris began to make aname for themselves in the industry Nikewanted a piece of the pie and wasdesperately trying to secure a footholdwithin the lucrative skateboardingindustry their first attempt at crackingthe industry was a massive failure Nikesigned a young bam margera as its soleteam skater and launched a collection ofpoorly designed skate shoes that notonly resembled your mom's Skechers buthad three of the worst names Nike hasever cursed its Footwear with the airchode the air snack and the Shemp I meanlook at these it's no wonder skatersdidn't embrace Nikes first effortsskateboarding culture was unfortunatelymisunderstood by Nike they're soullesscorporate image failed to resonate withthe skateboard community after multipleattempts and a failed TV ad campaign itwas becoming clear that it

[Music]hi Jacob jr. sport web TV now fall isupon us in winter is knocking on thedoor which means that it's gettingcolder all the time therefore today I'mtaking a look at the Under Armour coldgear and nightly hyper warm base layersboth the shirts and the tights yes JayMike in tights is happening today butI'm also gonna give you my opinion onsome essential accessories when it comesto staying warm so if you like myselfhate being cold when you're playingfootballdon't go anywhere just yet[Music]so starting off with this bad boy theunderarmor cold your game day long sleepimpression mug got it good now apartfrom being made to keep your game tightit's mainly made to keep you warm anddry because when the sweat cools down onyour body that is when you start to feelcold so in order for you to feel wellthe sweat has to be removed in your bodyand this is why the Under Armour coolgear shirt is made from two layers nowthe inside is made from this fleece likematerial that not only takes your bodyheat and circulates it around your torsoto keep you warm it also takes themoisture and sweat and pushes it awayfrom your body and on to the outer layerof the shirt which is made from fibersthat dry a lot faster which in turn willkeep your upper body warm dry and not[Music]the fifth in the underarmor cold here isreally great it fits you extremelytightly almost skin tight and offers youa great compression as well but mostimportant of all this technologyactually works so it transport the sweataway from your skin and keeps you dryand even though the first five minutesof play actually might feel a littlecold because your body hasn't startedgiving off that much heat yet once youstart working but he takes in and keepsyou nice and warm and to be honest withyou the Under Armor cold gear is one ofthe best out there for the job and alsoit comes in a load of different colorswhich is great let's do a catwalk nowthe cold air collection also featurestights and the idea is basically thesame with moisture wicking andcompression the tides come in threedifferent lengths and what's importantto me when I play especially with thelong ones is that they don't can do mymovements which luckily none of these dono matter the length and most importantof all they also keep my legs warm a[Music]great alternative to the colder shirt isthis guy the nike hyper warm compressionmach 2.0 now the nike hyper one shirtscome in a lot of different versions someof them with this shield technology onthe sleeves and whatnot but to be honestwith you the hyper one compression mach2.0 has enough cool technology in itselfto be sufficient and even though theshield technology is kind of cool youdon't necessarily need more than thiswarmth now the Hyperwarm compressionmach 2.0 is made from the Nike dri-fitmaterial and the concept is pretty muchthe same as I described before where theinside is made with this fleece likematerial that pushes moisture and sweataway from your body and the outside ismade from these smaller fibers and poolsto spread out the cool thing is thatwhen the moisture and sweat news fromthe inside to the outside of the shirtit spreads out to a larger area of theshirt thus allowing it to dry faster[Music]Nike have also got some pretty coolalternatives and one of them is the NikePro combat compression type which doesexactly as the name suggests offer you alot of compression and it's pretty coolwhen it's just chilly but then againit's not overly warm so when it's quitecold you should instead take a look atthe Nike hyper warm tide which isequipped with this flocked fleece likematerial as we see in the shirts as wellin other words these tights really keepyour thighs warm and they workexcellently when it's cold outside sowhen the first layers are sorted it'stime to get done dressing up for thecold weather and for that the Pumawindbreaker suit that I've got on righthere is pretty cool because not only isit light and breaks off the wind it'sactually also water repose so you don'tget all soaked when it rains one of thebest things about the windbreaker suitis the pants that come in a full lengthand three-quarter length version and thepants have an amazing fit they fitrather tight but in unknown restrictiveways you can still move kind of freelyokay so it's not exactly waterproof butit doesn't rain this much anyway so it'skind of it another thing you want to dowhen it's cold out there is to keep yourhead and your ears warm this is a Nikehat it keeps your headand your ears warm enough set nowanother winter essential is the cropconnect tube but apart from your justkeeping your net warm you can actuallyuse the crop neck tube for a lot ofstuff right now it's a scarf now it's abalaclava and now it's a headband if youSol please and you can actually use thisfor a lot of stuff now one of the worstthings about playing football in thecold is to have cold fingers thesolution is pretty simple wear glovesand Nike and Under Armour have onceagain come up with some pretty coolalternatives and use their quick dryingheat per serving technology to makethese gloves now the Nike gloves areslightly thicker and therefore a bitwarmer whereas the Under Armour gloveshave a slightly more creepy palm to themthan the Nike gloves they also fit you abit more tightly but all in all it's amatter of preference and after allthey're just gloves they're here to keepyour fingers warm so summing it all upchoosing between the hyper warm and thecold gear is actually a pretty toughtask because they both do their jobspretty well and without any

[Music]it's samuel rossfounder of a cold war welcome to thefirst episodeof explore without boundaries a newseriesthat takes you inside nike designexplorationnde is really about exploringthis notion of true creativity venturinginto the unknown and pushing designbeyond what is currently established wespoketo nick and we spoke to chamise from theisba team we also spoke to wilsonwho is considered a veteran within thenike not just solely uh footwear processbut also within the nike architectureand industrialdesign space yeah and i remember likekind of first meeting the two of you andthis ispaconcept was like incubation phase andyou were both kind of taking me rememberthere was this onespace and you kind of show me all of theprototypes so on herei'm assuming we can talk about roadwarrior it's just a beautiful piece ofdesign and the forms are incrediblyuh lucid to a certain degree andesoteric butso well refined and the response that myteam gave was the exact same responsethat my daughter who is two and a halfgave this afternoonas well the first thing people will payis wow what is this i'm on the righttrack righti think also because of the storytellingand the team effortit's it's such a love shoe right now butthere were also a lot of question markslike what theis this you know like yeah yeah becauseit's so much like is it too much orbut then again like celebrating what wehave for me was a verya good point that's what we have what wedo as a team like we celebratewhat we find and what we have and likecombining it along the wayturned out to be this this great shieldyeah i think what's really interestingis how these technologies are combinedtogetherhow do you because it's a lot in therein those tubes andit's kind of new hybrid of shoes thatare mergingwith the road warrior and having thatplate it's totally exposedshowing it's really true technology it'snot hidden awayit's there it's visible you can see theinner workings of it which i think isnice we're kind of likeopening up instead of like closing it orhiding away the technology we'reexposing it so people can see itthey can understand it and they can havetheir own interpretation of itso i think that's what's reallyinteresting is what those shoes kind ofprobe inout to people yeah i see um you andyou guys together you know shamise andmeek i see youyou you doing new remixes on on a numberof things which is really kind of reallyexcitingum those opportunities of kind ofbuilding a building going forwardi like your generational take because ilike i feel like theythings build on top of each other andthere isn't there is like a lineage likeyou can look at theat the heritage or the history ofdifferent design movements and how onekind of builds on top of anotherthat's almost the best part isn't itlike of the design process is almostthrowing concept against concept againstconcept againstyou know the brittle glass wall and youkind of see what sticks you see whatfalls off and you learn through thatprocess and you keep going at it againyou can see there's such a differentlike cycling philosophy that's beenapplied to ispa fromany other form of nike product that'scome forth can you highlight a littlebit more aboutwhat that philosophy kind of looks likei think ourdirector has kind of created a spacefor different types of people to come infrom different disciplinarybackgrounds different culturalbackgrounds andhe allowed us to kind of come togetherand explore these narratives of what wefeltlike the world is evolving into and thatkind of sparkedmore conversation and ideas of how wecan evolve some of the products that wecurrently build for at nike and in fuelteami really like that whole idea of likebeing unafraid to fill within our teamlike it's almost as if our team is thisthis safety net likefailure is good of course but actuallydoing it is the next stepi think we sort of started this idea oflike uhhow to implement innovation within uhnike sportswear so it started as afull-on experiment and whilebrainstorming we actuallyi think shimizu also came up with thisof likebucketing it into four ideas ofphilosophy and as a group we sort ofstarted creating this philosophy aroundwhat isba isyeah and i think they're always everevolving as well like every time we lookat thosesimple words of improvised scavengeprotecting the depth like we approachthem differently throughto through the the storytelling you'reinspiring me a lot with what you'resaying but i thinki think that we what we were doing backin the day is nowfully realized today and so it's reallyit's fun to seetransferring over time it's interestingyou knowit's that's actually a really good likejuncture tothe next point we know we wanted to talkabout which was regarding like the teamand having like um a fearless team andhaving this shared philosophy buthaving such a diverse amount of uhspecialists really involved innike ispa definitely i think that's thekind of key source for ispain that sense we need to have those kindof diverseexperiences and insights anddifferent understandings of words orstorytellingand i think with that when we all cometogether to discuss this and build thesenarratives and build these productstogetherit's cool to have a differentperspective on it design thinking reallycomesout of a lot of architectural thinking ithinkas designers we can see where wherestories happenthat are maybe happening in graphicsthat are also happening in architectureor even in car design or you look aroundand they're even in music and so so alot of this translates and transfersover if you both had any predictionson the future of like footwear designas a whole but obviously at nike as wellwhat would you believe there are anyelements from ispa that are really gonnamove into the future footwear designlike if there were two or three pointsyou could extractbased on the prediction what would youthink they would befor me i think i see ispa being moreecologically minded i feel like we'reexamining the use of materials nowand we're rethinking the lifespan ofmaterials and incorporating that intothe design processand i think that's an exciting space togo into because some of thesebiological materials behave in strangeways so we kind of have to embracethe potential of failure but i thinkit's reallyan interesting space to exploredefinitely and i'm excited by that ifthere was anyyou know advice you could give to thefuture generationsregarding design be open to beinginspiredsay if you're if you're designingapparel if you're designing footwear beopen to all the differentexpressions and genres of design and sobe open toanything from music to to art to umarchitecture and you know just really beopen to all those to kind of to informum what you're doing trusting theweirdness in you or likeyeah believing in that that thing thatpeople might go with and then eventuallybecomes the standard or normal and ithinkdesigners and artists have that skill inthem maybe a bit more than othersso try to protect embrace and trust it idefinitely agree with nickand what i would add is also becollaborativeand you need it you need to understandother people's viewpointsbackgrounds their experiences that willenrich yourthinking your approach to design i thinkthat's key you can't just think it'sjust yourselfyou know you have to think of yourselfas being part of the collectivesome of my closing thoughts from episodeonetrial and error is important trial anderror is beyond important chinais essential to the design processerror doesn't really exist there is ait's a part ofwhat we do as designers the reality isamazing work happenswhen you put yourself into work when youput yourself through the personaljourney when you takeyour own personal background andexperiences and intereststhat's when amazing work istruly produced i'm samuel ross thanksfor watching,17,UC5SQGzkWyQSW_fe-URgq7xw,Unisport,161,56,0,3634,"['unisportlife', 'unisport',

today we're going to be talking aboutb-grade nikes and jordans we're going togo over if they're real if they're fakewhat you think about it is it okay tocollect them i got a bunch of differentquestions i got some different answersfrom peopleand i'm excited to share the resultswith you guys and obviously educate youand help you understand the differencebetween an authenticand a b grade all right let's get it[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already don't forgetto hit the subscribe button join thefamily join the squad and smash the likebutton because that helps the algorithmowe so much and with all that being saidwe need to talk about b grades brobecause a lot of people have somemisconceptions about this shoeand i want to clear it all up for youguys today so i went to instagram and iasked my followers three questions ifyou haven't alreadymake sure you follow me on ig so thatway you can participate in the polls aswellthe first question was are b grade nikesand jordans considered to be fake thesecond question was is it okay to rockor collect bgrades and the third and final questionwas is this band 1fire or trash stick around to the end ofthe video to see what the results areyou're going to be really shocked sofirst off let me explain what a bgrade is a b grade is a sneaker that hasa defect to itin some type of way and quality controldid not pass itand allow it to be sold to the publicbecause they didn't think that it metthe standardof what they wanted for their product atthe retail price so when the shoe isbeing manufacturedthey could have a potential mess up theycould put too much glue on it ormis-stitch the patternor miss the laces or have somethingwrong with it where there's a scuff onthe side of the footor whatever it may be there could besome small small blemishes thatsometimes you can never even telland then sometimes there's huge thingsthat's like i can definitely tell thisis a b-grade shoebecause the pattern of the shoe is alittle bit off and it's kind of lopsidedor the outsole was put on incorrectly orsomething like that but there are somany different reasons as to whyquality control will not allow it topass so for example say nike wants tomake a hundred thousand pairs of asneakerand they have ten thousand pairs weremessed up that's a huge problem theydon't wanna have ten thousand pairsmessed upthey don't wanna just trash them andthrow them away so what were they gonnadothey're gonna put them at stores likeross and nike outlets and differentthings like thatand sell the sneaker at a discountedrate so that way they can still makesome money off of the shoeand not just take a complete loss sowhen it comes to finding bgrade sneakers again like i just saidross nike marshalls different placeslike thator where are you going to be able tofind the good licks on a b grade shoesometimes b grades even have the entirebox all the laces and they look likethere's nothing wrong with the shoeand then there can be other times wherethey have a replacement box with adifferent tagand the shoe may look like there'ssomething wrong or there's like a gluestain on it or a mid-stitch pattern butyou can't really tell too muchand you can get away with it and you'llbe like okay that's cool i justbasically got the same exact shoe for adiscounted ratecan't be mad at it so for example wehave the cap and gown air jordan13 right here and this is a b grade shoeit comes in a different boxwith the nike lid and obviously a nikebox that you typically get for any othernike shoenot a jordan brand sneaker like youwould get with the black box with thejumpman on it and different things likethatso that's already one thing that isnoticeable about a b grade compared to aregular retro that released to thepublicfor retail the next thing to look for isthe stamp on the boxwhere it says cosmetic seconds that'sinitial telltale right therethis is a b grade so if you look at thetag on the box right here air jordanretro 13and it has the same type of tag that youwould typically get on an air jordan boxbut they put that on this box to let youknow this is a shoe that is a jordanbut we're putting it in this box becauseit's a secondary one we don't reallyfeel like producing the real box thatyou needbecause we already know this shoe has adefect so when i open the box right hereas you can see we have an air jordanretro 13 in all black when you take afirst glance at this shoehonestly it's hard to see any defectsand it looks actually really good butfor some reason nike decided to makethis a bgrade and not release it to the publiclike they would the retail versionso let's figure out why so looking atthe outsole it looks pretty good workingmy way up to the midsole things arelooking goodthere's a small patch of glue just alittle bit right here by the toe areaand honestly that's about the only thingthat is wrong with this shoeso you can literally buy this shoe at adiscounted ratebecause it has a little glue stain righthere on the shoe which you can see rightthere in a detailed shotand i think when you're wearing itnobody's even gonna notice another hugething to note iswhen you look inside of the size tagright here there's a bstamp in red on the inside of the sizetag right here you're going to see thatat nike outlets at ross whenever a shoeis considered to be a b grade it'salways going to have that stampwith the b inside of it on the shoesometimes it may be in red and sometimesit may be a blue stamp but either wayit's always going to be on the sizetag inside that shoe so overall thisshoe may be decreased in value becauseit's considered a bgrade but at the end of the day youcould still resell it for money andstill be able to make a profiton a sneaker like this especially whenyou see a small defectthat's really barely noticeable andhonestly it's only on one foot it's noteven on the left foot it's only on theright side so really finding somethinglike this is always a good deal in myopinion so just like you saw right thereon those 13syou can see that it had a different boxand yes it has a glue stain butessentiallyyou're getting a great deal on a shoethat nobody's really going to know whenyou're wearing it on your feet and ithink that springs up the next one rightherethis shoe is called the air jordan 1band as you can see it has a special boxwith the x on hereit has the what if with the price tag igot these for 109.99they originally wanted these to be soldfor 125at the suggested retail price but theydidn't even do that and they discountedthem even morebecause they had a defect on each andevery shoe from the entirebatch so this shoe right here actuallynever came out to the publicat like a foot locker or a champs oreast bay or something like that or evennike.comit only released at nike outlets andthere was actually basically like arelease for itbecause when people found out they endedup doing a launch for it at the storesso me personally when this shoe came outi knew it was a diamond in the rough andthat's one thing that i love aboutshopping for b grades and differentoutlet finds because you can find somegreat shoesfor a really good deal so i just want toopen this up and show you guys this shoeright herei bought over 20 pairs of these at thefactory store and each and every singleshoehad a defect to it but what i did was ihad picked up multiple size 13sand all i did was pick out the best twoshoes left and right so when i hadbought these from the storei bought all of the pairs in the size13. i picked out the best twoand then i kept these in my collectionbecause i know this was the best lookingoneof those versions but one thing thatthey did have a problem with when itcame to thesewas the stitch on the leather and thenthe cut of the leather and the placementof it also there was fading on theleather as welland then there were some other problemswith promo and different things likethatbut they just could never get it rightwhen it came to this shoe so some peoplehave some terrible versions of thissneakerand other people have some really nicelooking versions like this one as wellbut at the same time 110 dollars for ashoethat is now worth roughly 2 000 you seewhat i'm saying you can definitely get agoodsneaker at a ross or an outlet orsomething like that that's superexclusive super rare sometimeseven like a sample type sneaker theyhave shoes like that so neverunderestimate bgrades again just to reiterate b gradesare notfake shoes they are a shoe with a defectthat came directly from nikeand is even sold at a nike outlet storeagainb grades are not fakes so like i askedwith the questions earlierlet's get into the results and see whatother people think and what other peoplesaybecause i think you might be shocked bythese results so the first question arebgrade jordans and nikes fake 26 percentof the people said yeshonestly i think that is a problem theyare notfake they just have a defect and ialready explained all that stuff to youso i think that negative stigma rightthere that already gets put on itand people thinking that they're fake ihope that they understand by the end ofthis videothat it is okay to get b grades and theyare authenticand they are legit the only thing isthey have a small defect so the nextquestion is it okay to rock or collectb grades and honestly i think yes it isokaybut this is what the people said 19 ofthe people said no81 said yes the same 19 of the peoplethat said bgrades were fake in the last poll alsosaid that it's not okayto buy them rock them or collect them sothey think that it's not okay to do itbecause they're fake but realisticallythey're not fakeso people are missing out on great dealsbecause they have a wrong mindseton a shoe that is actually authenticjust with the defense so this next oneisvery funny i literally took the band oneand i said is this shoefire or is this shoe trash and it ishilarious what the results saybecause 93 of the people set fire andseven percent of the people said trashall those people that were literallyjust saying it's not okayand they're fakes and all thesedifferent things just contradictedthemselvesand now they're talking about oh thisshoe is fire this shoe is dope but youjust said it's not okayso people have to understand thatsometimes people just don't get it and ihopethis video helps people get it because ihear a lot of people out therethat are confused and don't understandthat and talk bad about peoplethat buy b grades and that maybe that'sonly they can affordbut it's the same thing it's okay and ijust want to keepreiterating that it is okay to rockcollect have b grades in your collectionso what do you guys think about theresultsdrop a comment down below i'm excited tohear what you have to say because to meit is hilarious how they say oh it's badto have b grades or bgrades or fake but then when i pull up ashoe like this oh it's a grill and allthose different things souh i think you should pick size and gowith the right answer and say yes it'sokay to collectb grades or have them in your collectionand yes theyare real and yes these are dope don'tjust be likeoh it's bad try to create a negativestigma to this shoeor to a b grade not knowing that theyare authenticeverything is great they just had asmall defect to the shoe so i hope youguys enjoyed this videoi had a pretty good time seeing theresults just kind of laughing and seeingthat the same exact peoplethat voted all this is bad literallyhyped up the band once and we're takingtime to dm meto tell me how dope the band one was butthennegative vibes when it came to nothaving b grades or bgrades were fake bro these are b gradeslikewhat do you not get so anyways that's mytime don't forgetto like comment share and subscribe igots to goi'm gone

hi and welcome to the running channeli'manna and this is tom oh yeah now tom'smade a few brief appearancesin some of our videos before but usuallytom is the one behindthe camera and editing our videosbut today he's going to be swapping thecamera for a pair of running shoesyeah that's right today i'm going to betesting the nike vapor fly next percentshoescompared to my normal running shoes nowbefore we get this incredibly scientificexperimentunderway please do hit subscribe and tapthe bell icon so you get notified whenwe uploadnew videos all about running which we doevery week[Music]so how's all this come about well wewere having a chat in the office and tomsaid that he quite fancy trying out thenikevapor fly next percent shoes but as anavid park runner and someone who runsoccasionally he didn't really feel likethese shoes were for him after allwe see them on the feet of elites whoare going out smashing world recordsno offense tom not quite you but we wantto find out how muchfaster these shoes can make an averagerunnerso it's the nike vapour fly nextpercents that we're going to be tryingrather than the newer versions like thealpha flyand that's because the next percents area little easier for beginners to get togrips withwhereas the alpha flies do take a littlebit more getting used to because theyare sowildly different from regular runningshoes so how much faster can they makean average runnerlet's find out so to make this test fairi'm going to be running two 5k runs overtwo weeksthe first in my regular running shoes atasic's gt 2000sand the second in my nike vapor fly nextpercents stay tuned for the resultsready three two one goi know that i'm not supposed to go offtoo fastand it's something that i always do andthen end upcrashing at the end so i'm going to tryand take it easyi have no idea what pace i'm running ati don't own a watch average runnerand uh see how it goes what's your usualpark run timeum it's about 30 minutes umour pb's are i think 28.so people take a few seconds was thatwhen you missed a lapwell we didn't talk about that i wentback and did the lapsome of these hardcore laps areconfusing how are we feeling tomum i've just been informed that i setoff quite fast for my average pacei'm feeling fine at the moment ask meagain in 10 minutesand i'll probably be dying umi think that's a big problem with me assomeone that doesn't run a lotor a series of times and stuff like thatisi run on field and right at the start ofeveryrun you're fresh and you're eager to gosoi uh i'm more of a a hair at the startand a snare at the endwe're 1k downtown we justgot a bit of an incline already got abit of a stitchuh this videomight end quite quite sharpish becauseuhi might seem to not be able to run[Music]it's a big hill i mean it's not that bigbutit's quite big for me i wouldn't even dohill wraps up i wouldn't do hill rapsfor a start but it wasfor me oh i love hate relationshipbecausei love running down them already come onit's hurtingthis is only the first lap3k in 3k too many i'm getting into itnowi've already had stitch number one andi've fought for itlike that strong little man i have[Music]i hated this hell on the first wayaroundi still don't like it that much but ihaven't got to do it anymorewhich is a bonus just hit 30 minutesi stood there about 30 minutes sobecause they're about[Music]this will be my first 5k without walkingfor a very long timei like to fit of a sneaky walk every nowand then because you knowwhen you're running alone it's only youthere sokind of anna filming me and no one'sthere to watchand the whole saying about your onlycheating yourself welli'm okay with that i'm so proud of himthreetwo one stop that clockoh hey feeling oh wellit was awful quite frankly 5kisn't ever a distance i often runwithout stopping buti felt a bit of the pressure today witha team here i'm quite proud of myselfactually uh not walking for probablythe first time in three or four monthsso the time on the clock 34.35i mean i said around 30 minutesand it's around 30 minutes give or takea few minutesseconds whatever um but uh i'm quiteglad i did itthe uh trying to get the excuses in butit's quite hillyyeah i'm glad it's over and we'll seeyou next week with thenike next vapor flies[Music]so it's week two 5k number two thomasgot his vapour flying next percent onready to rolltom how are you feeling fast i'd like tothink so they do feel dead springy whenyou put them on and stand up you feellike you're getting pushed forwardthe whole way around hopefully i do feellike i'm getting pushed forward thewhole way aroundbut we'll see let's put it to the testready yep threetwo one gothe spring is real um to be honestrunning downhill to start off with andthey don't really feel much different toany other shoppingon the flat is when i will definitelyfight feel the difference or evenup hills but um a lot lighter i'll tellyou that[Music]first up hill tom definitely feel it nowum i'm not sure if that's how they'redesigned to workbut um the uphill i feel like i'mgetting pushed up it a bit morethere's more energy return in the hillgoing forwardsand it's not as hard so uhwe'll see i guess ask me on the secondone i don't know if i noticed muchdifferencereally like uh the heel is nice andcushioned um compared to my other shoesbut do i feel fasteri guess we'll have to find out at theendwell we've just gone through the firstkilometer 20 seconds faster than lastweek sowill it continue those hill number twothe big onemight i add at least a 50 gradientit's not 50. 100 50probably like threehow we doing umyeah umthe main thing i'm feeling is they'rejust comfylike there's cushion a big thing with mycurrent running shoes isbecause i don't have that much time onfeet my feet would acheum even lowlow distances so there's none of thatwith these shoesand obviously the added benefit are youknow they arean elite high performing pair of shoesso um if they're comfy rightthen you've got the donna they look cooltooso obviously thisroute has a bit of downhill a bit ofuphilland quite a bit of flat as well but whenyou're downhillyou're falling downwards anyway so youfeel that andgoing uphill you're working harderbecause you know you have tobut on the flight is where i'm reallynoticingthe energy return it's almost like i'mconstantlyon a slight decline on a flat which isa lovely feeling sodon't worry[Music]4k down 1k to go how are you feeling umthe uphills are still crap oh sorrythe uphills are still just as badbut the downhills and the flats feel alot niceri think physically in terms of my bodymy feet and my legs feel a lot moreprotectedand i can feel the benefit there butultimately as the average runner thethingletting me down is my aerobic fitnessand uhi don't think that's something shoes canhelp withtime jack four and a half k 28 minutes36 that's 400 metersbut i feel like there's a bit left in mesosee what i can do got a spring finish inthere sprintfaster andyou're donehow you feeling how aboutabout the same as last time it's alovely stitching[Music]it's a lot of hard work but i think theinstantreaction is when muscles in my bodyfeel like they can go on um and thatmight be due to the added supporti've mentioned a few times before thatthey feel more cushionedmy feet feel nicer and they are quite atight fit soit's almost like having like some sortof compression sock on almostor something like that that's how i'dsee it anyway umbut ultimately like i said previouslyyou can't cheat aerobic fitnesswith shoes you might get marginal gainsbutthe places i'm running i think yourbiggest increaseis just fitness right so now it's timefor the results i'm really excited forthis because tom has no idea what he'sjust run5k in in the nike vapor flight nextpercent so i'm here to deliver theresults so tomlast week you ran 5k in your regularrunning shoesin a time of 34 minutes and 35 secondswe came back this week did the samecourse this time in the nikevapour flying next percent and you ran5k in a time of 31minutes and 54 seconds so an improvementof aroundtwo minutes 40. wow the um there'sobviously some technology in there thatmakes me run a bit quicker i can't gainthree minutes overjust a week right um the carbon plateand the energy return obviously has doneits job somewhereso i'm really pleased with that time aswell really impressive and hopefullythat gives you an ideaof the kind of gains that the averagerunner can get from theseelite focused carbon plated shoes whatdo you think of the shoesfancy getting a pair now that

Philip today is something he was apretty specialyeah it's not every day you get a boxlike this off-white for Nike NikeMercurial Vapor um I think we kind ofall know what's inside of this box Idon't actuallyit's a Virgo a blow I know but I do notknow how it looked you know you know youhaven't seen before no um you can kindof you get a gist we sell with this uheven this box right here which is prettynice is it what it is oh we got the logouh kind of guess that's logo oh that'sfor me let's go up there alright let'sdo it alrightoh that is over this mess that is somebright color does that say bag on thisoneHey it says boo back Oh actually does itdoes say boo back oh and of course itsays off-white and all that jazz andinside you do get different phrases whoathat says shoelaces obviously just so weknow what it is so we know what it isthank you burgle a blow so don't mix upthe shoelaces with the boot bag anddon't put the boot bag on their bootswhen you play I mean you can kind of seewhere we're going hereum for the height beats out there Ithink you already know what's insideboom boom we all have like this thepaper here but it's even says pay for acolor got everything with a paper withthe paper the vapor with the paper andlet's just say that these are like veryvery very very special um obviously forevery off-white our virgle Apple fan outthere this must be a wet dream and Igotta say to some extent this is also awet dream why because we have the tinyNike logo yes I'd know where it belongsso it kind of looks a little bit like aV but to you which I like a lot so uh sowhat what do we think I mean it it doeslook a bit like it yes I was just aboutto say that's then as you as youmentioned I really like this the smallswoosh yes it's rather than a big oneits undertow beautiful and to be honestI think they don't look half bad when Iwhen I saw the pictures for the firsttime I like nah kidding me uh but Iactually like them in handit actually appeals to me especiallywith this this white line here yeaharound the trim oh sorryaround the soleplate and it goes all theway around even underneath yes what'sreally really cool and for once insteadof having this very Cromieyeah finish up to the to the soleplate Ilike how it's just are not almosttranslucent plastic while in the colorone color it looks pretty big of courseit says then on the bottom ECC Flyknitand fast AF because it is a part of thefast day of night um we got the the kindof customary off-white Nike MercurialVapor and even if you're a high P's thenyou know about off y-you know whatthey're all about all the yes in it hereon the it says engineered to the exactspecification of championship athletesthat's beautiful too on the back righthere mmmengineered full speed limited edition itsays instead of vapor 360 pretty niceand then of course um the creme de lacreme we got thoughall of them on this side um and apartfrom that that's basically all theystoodI mean virgle he um yeah it's a verysimplistic way of looking at things butI think it's kind of special becausethere's not a lot of people that does itthis way no it's very it's veryin-your-face right yes because they'rebasically pointing out stuff that youalready know let you know this is a bootit's me in that regard I know a lot ofpeople really like Varga well why not Ithink some of his stuff is really cooltoo but you can't deny that he's hisstyle is very at least this style I'dlike it's done with with Nike with thehold the 10 pack they made it's it'svery like one concept with the wholequotation marks and then stating theobviousokay nice isn't it this is shoe lacesetc etc I think some people will bebummed that we don't have to hold ourread price that kind of thing but to behonest I think it would look a littlebit ridiculous confidence so that's kindof what it but you actually haven'tmentioned the - you know dots that wehave what what are those all about thiskiss I think it makes like it stands outa bit and it makes them look a littlebit like clown shoes I'm just gonna sayyeah you know don't kill me out therebut I'm just gonna say you you know youyou say you say the clown angle but I'mjust gonna go out and say that the bluedot doesn't like for me doesn't makesense it's not that in look it's notthat it looks bad it's just that likeokay I see it kind of a pattern herewith the the kind of wall vault yellowand the orange the white line and thenthe blue just pops out of nowhere it I Iwould totally totally we we do it is I'mnot saying it's bad I'm not saying it isbad it's like it's a little bit weird itis now the funny thing and i which ithink is a bit of a shaming it was thatbecause habló decided to have the thelocal thing on the side here now you canactually see how Nike had to UM tobasically toe little further up so onthe normal vapor we have this gradualshift in the Nike skin coding where itstarts to be by being fullon the bottom and then it gradually goesup the side so we can basically get amore should we say flexible image on theupper but you can basically see how theyhad to just give it our full coating allthe way up so they could write on theNike skin because they can't write on itit is very very important informationthat you get right here it's not quitetrademark for Nikeyes Nike Mercurial Vapor and the logo is69 million but that's just a start andand you can you can argue for andagainst I think I thought these arerelatively cool if we could kind of losethe blue dot and don't you know somepeople might call it you know sacrilegethen I want to lose the blue dot forwhatever but I think this really doesdoes the trick for me yeahI really love it but I really think it'sa shame that if they really had to coatit I'm REE uh in order to put the theswoosh on like just I'm gonna I'm gonnabe go ahead and be honest here as welllike if you think that someone will buythis and be like hey I'm gonna rock thison the pitch because I'm off-white fanWow and then and then complain about thefact that it's coated here yeah and Idon't think that you should get thevirtual habló I think you should go justhead and get these instead yeah becauseobviously these are virtual ah flows offwhite Nike collaboration and they arespecial they're not made to you know fora you know rainy March afternoon ohthey're not no no no but but like thefunny thing is I I gotta be honest Ithink these look alright but I have notreally warmed yet to the to the toeflush this is how I think this workshould look on the new vapor and theSuperfly that's how it is another thingpeople need to know is that this isgonna come out as a vapor 12 but on thepitch it's actually gonna be worn by aCanadian poppy who will wear a super flyversion of it so is something like thatyeah it's gonna be very interesting tosee he's obviously gonna wear it in theFrench Cup final so so pretty cool thatthey keep it with a French player inPali III like that and honestly I gottasay though that I think to go withorange and white is a more of akiller than to go with orange and kindof tinted chrome it looks it lookspretty cool right it's like even thoughit's a very hyped up colorway it's verylike in-your-face but I gotta say thatthe white toning it down makes it evenmore I I would agree with you now ofcourse this is gonna be hyped to themoon and back and that's just how it iswith with burgle Apple collaborationyeah the funny thing about virgle a blowthat we talked about just before we gotstarted was that uh it was announced abig night um that he is taking over thethe creative director position and formenswearnow the funny thing is that and yeswe're gonna talk about the box later toto show that but the funny thing is thatthat the position as creative directorspeaking of suitable boxes yes um it wasuh it was left vacant by this time Ilike in jobs yeah who basically Istepped down as the creative directorfor Louboutin in January and now they'vereleased this now is it just me or is ittoo big of a coincidence the night youhappen to collaborate with the twopeople stepping you know one stepping upone stepping down from I think it's afunny coincidenceit is it is even even though Virgilhablo did a lot of things before thiscollaboration we as Nike yes you knowit's too funny not to be but that'sthat's it just it just occurred to methat it was kind of funny I gotta say interms of this I do appreciate thesoleplate here with his name slapped allover it with his name's o Jones comeJonesoh just though that we know he's just agreat just in case you didn't knowanyways I like the the virgle a blowmade for twelve a lot more I'm gonna goahead and say this that the orange hereno pun intended but I see a pattern herewith thesorry I just had to sew on but what I dosee a pattern and I I do think out ofthese three I gotta say that the outlawsare the better look at once of all thethree I would and it's only because ofthe the the small swoosh yes and thetone down white and the same color yeson the soleplate yes so we could losethem like the blue bubble of shenanigansand the hole I'd mid all over the placedoes not really feeling that you knowbut but you know the white and the samecolor soleplate is is exactly what alsoappeals to me so good job burgle a blockum very good job actually again boncalawhatever they they say gets them face Ithink that's a good word for an inFrench I'm not sure Philipany last words on these becauseobviously people are gonna freak outabout it yeah let's just talk about thisall right this is what I really want toappreciate go ahead and preciate thatbecause that was that's pretty coolshe's you know all the details on theboxIza is pretty wicked a lot of bunny earsdid it in the paper even the paper we'veliked all the customary stuff it's it'sjust it's cool and that's the thing withwith Virgil Apple that he just makesthings that are he follows through hemakes cool things and and yeah he foundhis niche okay and he now is

these are an unfair improvement overnormal running shoes[Music]inside of these boxes i have the twoshoes that are the greatest innovationin nike running that they'veever done have you heard about the twohourmarathon because nike was able to haveone of their runnerstrain work on research and developmenton these shoesfor years and years and then run andactuallybreak the two hour marathon which a lotof people didn't think was humanlypossible this is the shoe that theyfirst tried to break the two-hourmarathon inand they missed it by like a minute ortwo it was so dang closethis is the vapor fly and what's cool isthat when lincoln designed his own shoethree years agothey actually let us see these in thetop secret r d lab and they told us thatinside of here is a carbon fiber platewhich makes it really hard to actuallybendbecause there's a carbon fiber platewhich should help youget propelled on every step and go alittle faster kind of like a springit got really controversial because alot of the nike runners were going to beusing these in the olympics that didn'thappen because of corona and the otherrunners that weren'tusing these shoes were a little upsetabout it saying that this gave them anunfair advantagein the end they ruled that as long asthese are sold to the general public andit's not some prototype versionthen runners can use those shoes insideof the olympicsso it's sold to the public i was able toget some well after they failedbreaking it with thisthey made the alpha fly and this is theone that broke itand you can see a little bit of adifference in the back it still has thisfunky littleaerodynamic pointy thing that looks likeit should have like a knife on it that'sgonna stab somebodybut um on the front you can seean air zoom pocket on here these are sotightlike i can barely move them we're goingto explore the insideof this shoe and see what the deal islike what does the carbon fiber platelook like is there anything else insideof this shoethat makes it amazing and then the thingthat i want to knowis how well would this work on anaverage runner like a regular everydayperson that you seejogging on the street not somebodythat's entering the boston marathonand finishing in the top ten in order todo a real world test of this shoewe need a runner so i got my uhcameraman heretoday it's not really my cameraman wegot zach from jerryrig everythingif you haven't noticed this guy has somemusclesand as part of that how often do you runitry to run every day a little bit um along time ago like six or seven yearsago i ran a couple marathons but i amnot in marathon shape right nowbut i am a runner kind of two weeks agozach ran what was it three miles exactlythree miles in 24 minutes and 24seconds how does that compare to yourusual time that was like me pushingmyself to the limitin regular shoes adidas boost tothese guys these guys the ultra boostthe ultra boostand so now if i run the same route inthese shoespushing myself the same way if i runfaster that means these shoes would giveme the advantage righti feel like it's a fair test it's in themorning it's early it's when he ran he'sgoing to run the same routethat he ran last time i'm going to bethere at the beginning and at the endhow do you track your runs just on myphone just the appyou just carry a phone in your pocketwell i carry my hand because thejust like this you just hold that thewhole time the whole time he just holdshis phone[Music]you already looked faster just byputting that on you look faster on thatone footthe aerodynamics[Music]they feel incredibly bouncy like it'shard to describe likei'm actually bouncier than a bouncy balllike you're walking on bouncy balls evenmore than that you know those giantexercise ballslike the bounciness of those is now onmymy legs want to go like thisi don't know this is going to be a weirdtest you look so fast those shortscouldn't have beenany more perfect so basically the guybroke the two hour marathonyou want to break the 24 minute threemilethree mile is that what you're what isthat what you're thinking like 25seconds left or something like that yepthat would be that's my goal we'll seewhat happens um last time i did pushmyself pretty hard though so we'lllet's see what's song choice today umthere's amaybe we shouldn't talk about music[Music]you ready i'm ready when you are meetyou back at the finish line all i haveto do is drive my carright hopefully i'll see you in lessthan 24 minutesokay jump for cars see buddyoh he already looks like he's bouncingwell i'm excited to getzach's thoughts whether he breaks it ornot um he'll have some good insightslet's go track zach down and then seehim at the finish line[Music]because there's a carbon fiber platewhich should help youget propelled on every step and go alittle faster kind of like a spring[Music][Applause][Music][Applause]zach is on the home stretch right now iam at milethree i see him at the top of this hillhe's just got to come down the hill andcomefinish so i'm excited to see the numbersi didn't track it on my phonehe's pushing it pretty good for a bigman 205 poundsand this guy's got a lot of muscle let'ssee how tired he is we might need togive him a break to chill for a secondhere he comes is that three miles finishcheck that you broke your new recordseven minutefour second mile that's insanethat's like take my record of 24 minutesrightyeah and slash three minutes off whatthat's crazy i did it instead of 24 24i did it in 21 19. dude that's a lot oftime yeah that's insaneand you feel like a lot of it has to dowith the shoes or you're just pushing itnow oh 100the shoes like before we started makingthis video myinch spiel at the end was gonna be likeit doesn't matter what equipment youhaveyou can just run in whatever and stillbe great but these arethese are an unfair improvement overnormal running shoesyou said earlier it felt like you wereon bouncy oh you catch your breath for asecond dude i'm good nowi'd go for another three i felt like iwasn'tusing as much effort as before and youknowi weigh a lot and so my right kneeusually hurts while i'm runningbut this time around nothing likethere's so much cushion in these shoesand likeit's crazy but one negative thing sincei weigh a lot i go throughshoes fast and the soles of these shoesare not like rubber they're likefoam there's quite a bit of wear rightthere like alreadylook at the front right there it'salreadylosing some of its tread just from athree-mile runyeah these shoes aren't gonna last verylong i love them though great shoesokay again i don't think i've said thisyet but this is not a sponsored video ispent like 300on these shoes you know zack he's goingto be completely honest with his opinionif he would have done worse or theywould have hurt him he would have saiditso we didn't just shave 24 seconds offof his time we shavedminutes off of just a three minute milejust a three mile run and he shavedminutes off of his timethe shoes definitely are working thankyou zach for helping us with this partof the videolet's get these back to our studio cutthem in half see what's inside of themand uh let lincoln guess what theresults are i'm curious to see if youcan even get close to guessinghow much faster zac run zack runzach ran i'm smartwe are back at the studio with mr nikehimselflincoln marcum look at that nike shirt alot of people have askeddid we purposefully block out the nikelogo no i mean for youtube videosthere's another nike swoosh right belowit this is the way it's changedright so these are the shoes lincoln hasseen them a little bitum like very bright andthey look kind of beat up zach hastested theseand they're very light these are thelightest shoes that i've ever heldleslie do you know the results of zack'srun i don't okay come hereyou do it i'm wearing matching greenzach ranthree miles as hard as he could in 24minutestwo weeks later we gave him these shoeshe ran three miles same routeyes and um how fast do you think he ranit in the issue 21 minutesexactly 21 minutes was it really yeah ohmy gosh well it's like 21 something it'slike 20 yearsbut it's still what he had to approachyou you didn'ttell me honestly i just did my mathgoing okay that's eight milesa minute zach has to be faster than thatin general exactly no that was his fasttime nono i feel like you're faster than thatnope the shoes are a minute fasterno i think that zach had the potentialto run faster tootry it again i think you can do betteroh 100the shoes that was like me pushingmyself to the limit zach and i werereally impressed with the shoeand that it could improve his time by aminute that yeah for an average runnerthat's impressiveleslie is not impressed with the shoeand she says that needs to step it upzach has more physical capabilities yougot to step it up zachyou're faster than that we got to followthe data the data doesn't lielook at these shoes try squeezing themit's hardit's hard that's what helps propel youlikeisn't that crazy[Applause]barely bend them in half where you takemost shoes and yeah the toe bendseasily where with this one if you canget an extrainch or two inches on every singlestride without any additionalphysical body effort well yeah you'regoing to arrive at your destinationfaster it's just simple math right rightdestinationyes math and see through tooso that's truegot it got it yes when you have arunning shoe you want it to beincredibly lightwell the top portion is a place of ashoe where peopleadd a lot of weight a lot of fabric andcloth that doesn't need to be therethis is so light there's nothing to itexcept for the backwhere it has a little cushion rightthere for your foot so that it doesn'tget asyou get blisters and stuff right there ithink this might be the carbon fiberplateright there that we're looking at hasthe two airzoom pockets that are on it you can pokeit should we poke it and see if it makesit nice do you think it'll popi think so here we goyeah made a little hissing noisenow let's see how it looks oh wowthey got to make that super strongthough because if that pops like duringyour raceso here's the inside of your zoom pocketit basically looks like whoa it's reallya tennis ballyeah or like a minky blanket if you'veever felt one of thoseit's incredibly soft yeah i was thinkingthat maybe it had some sort of springingeffectand there's got to be some sciencebehind this but really it's just someweird fabric that's in theremy knife was a lot sharper before istarted this project today[Music]it's like i'm filleting a fish right nowhey there's the foam yeahand then this says nike fly plateyeah it's basically the same materialjust ohwow look at that well you can break thecarbon fiber plate with your bare handsmuscles okay do you think that it wasbecausepart of this was off i think it'sbecause of my musclesthat is odd that it just fell offoh i'm so strong look at thatlook at that shoe wow that is sointerestingcarbon fiber it's very big it's veryvery wide right here where you land andthen it does get thinneron the back which makes sense well maybeit doesn't make sense i don't know i'mno engineer but it's like a spring itreally is like a springthat when you step this is this ismaking you just fly an extra inch or twoi am a believerin the nike alpha fly shoethere's also the vapor fly that we gaveto zach those who have similartechnologythey're also speed improvement shoes soum good job nike he's getting at therunning game and kicking some butt andit's coollet me know what you guys think wouldyou buy these shoes for a race is itworth it for aweekend warrior runner and do you thinki can break this with all the foam on itno ohit sounded like it wanted to right wowmuscles whoa yeahwow okay well you canyou can break it that one broke easilytoowow 75 but don't bend your shoe don'tbet yourselfthere's got to be a weight limit like ifyou weigh like 300 poundsyou're gonna run a marathon on thisthing it's just

I think a lot of runners are discouragedthat shoes have become such a huge focusin a sport that used to be seen as soelemental it was just about yourtraining and your fitness and you on theopen road and this shoe technologycontroversy has changed all that peoplewonder where was this regulation earlierthey feel like not all brands were giventhe same chance to develop thistechnology that may be the spirit of therules was largely ignored for severalyears on January 31st world athleticstrack and field's world governing bodyreleased new regulations about shoesworn in elite marathon competition inthe wake of a record-breaking times fromrunners wearing Nikes vapor fly shoesthe regulations set specific limitsabout the height and composition ofdistance running shoes soles can be nothicker than 40 millimeters and anyrigid plates must be in one continuousplane 2020 is an Olympic year theJanuary ruling means athletes can wearprototypes in February's Olympic Trialsbut any new shoes must be available atretail by April 30th if they're to beworn at the Tokyo Olympics so how areshoe companies scrambling to match Nikesvapor fly technology well I think thefirst objection by critics was thetiming because world athletics you knowhad received complaints about these Nikeshoes or concerns at least for at leastthe past two or three years and yet ittook until January for them to take anyreally specific action so I thinkcompeting brands were saying hey this isan Olympic year this is incrediblyimportant for not only development ofour technology but also for ourcompetitors who have their highestprofile competition the US is almostunique in the world in that it holdstrials for the Olympic marathon teammost other nations hand select theirmarathoners but in the case of the USyou have to finish in the top threeamong women are men to qualify of coursethat makes it incredibly important thatyou're in shape and that you have a shoethat can beat other runners earlier thisyear the Wall Street Journal studied thevapor fly asking experts to de-sect theshoe to demonstrate what some athletesand critics say give the shoes anadvantagesecond you can see the full-lengthcarbon-fiber plate and this carbon-fiberplateadds a lot of stiffness and stability tothe shoe as well it's a race to thespring deadline for brands to releaseshoes if they haven't already butcontain a carbon plate and comply withthe New World Athletics regulationswhile hookah onaona is Shu comparable tothe vapor fly technology has been outsince May 2019 we'll see debuts frombrands like saucony with their endorphinPro would be released globally on April15th Brookes will publicly launchedtheir Hyperion elite shoe on February29thbut announced five days before theOlympic Trials that some of their eliteathletes will be racing in the nextiteration the Hyperion elite 2 whichwill hit the market in late April aheadof the April 30th deadline adidas isadizero pro will be available to thepublic in select markets from April 1stand worldwide by May 15th New Balancereleased their fuel cell TC in Februaryand Asics will release their meta racershoe in spring but Nikes athletes maywear the new Alpha fly on February 29thit does have a thicker sole than thevapor fly but the brand has said it willcomply with the new regulationsprivately especially to one another somerunners who run on competing shoes haveexpressed concern about whether theirswill match up not only with the currentNikes but these yet unseen new Nikes Ithink some athletes and brands feel thatNike has too much influence in the sportit's the leading brand in performancerunning shoes and sponsors many manyathletes sponsors USA Track & Field thepresident of world athletics is alongtime former Nike sponsored athletecompetitors worry that maybe thatrelationship is a little bit too closewith the body that's supposed to beregulating it when asked about thebody's independence from Nike WorldAthletics responded in a statement weneed to balance what is currently in themarket at an elite level and draw a lineby prohibiting shoes that may go furtherthan what is currently on the marketuntil further research is undertaken andthat no shoe company was directlyinvolved in shaping the regulations anike spokesperson said in a statement tothe Wall Street Journal we believe thenew world athletics rules will stifleinnovation over the longterm ultimately impacting athletesconsumers and fans Brook said in acomment to the Wall Street Journalgenerally we would spend more timebetween prototype and bringing issue tomarket but the recent W a ruling pushedus to reassess or go to market strategyone of the reasons why these questionsabout shoes are so important is becauserunning isn't only for elites last yearin the u.s. about 50 million people wentrunning at least once and if there's ashoe that someone thinks is going tomake them run a half marathon or a 10kfaster they might be very interested inbuying it so this is not only a questionfor elites but it's also a question forthe market,26,UCEaTAQbuyJ_FWOOQ5OsbK5A,Shop Zappos,0,5,0,42,No Tags,Nike Renew In-Season TR 9 SKU: 9218865,03ERt2U6Ac0,14962

this movement that youfeel are really going to bethe anchors and vanguards of this new umphilosophy which is coming forth it'sliterally endlesswhat we can explore within biodesign andso we're workingon a yarn and algae yarn on aalgae-based inkum working on creating a 3d printing afilament for 3d printing that's madewith algaeand so we're trying to create kind oflike an entire ecosystem of materialsthey inherentlyare cleaning the environment and the airby just beingand they don't take up deforested landcan you share with us some of theapplicationsof course following the notions that youbrought forth that have started to umintegrate into the nike ispaproducts not just commercial product butalso applicationswhen we're thinking about sustainabilityand this was thinking about disassemblyand reductiveness and this idea ofreducing materialsreally analyzing the component treeswithin a shoeand and then looking at that to see ifwe canbuild it with less components thenpotentially we candisassemble it so then therefore we canput it into different recycling workstreamsum and then from there we're alsothinking about if we can do thatlet's like obsess the materiality ofthese umcomponents could they be you know frombiologically derived materials so thenthat will allow us to then be able tothen put it back into the ground andalso with these structures that youcreate these modular systemscould they then potentially be ummade into other objects or otherproducts does it necessarily have tohave one singular functionalitycould it have a second birth could ithave a third fourth berth for most ofthese productssorry guys it's just a great segue tokind of plug our next topic in umregarding this notion of like low-fi andhigh-tech which this really doessummarize quite wellbeing this idea of new aspiration andthe new luxury actually followingmore of a low-fi traditional techniqueof productionand aging versus what's kind ofdominated the last40 years of popular culture beingsynthetic fast fed materialsi think what's for me what's really umexciting about the way that caroline andthechimes have explained that they areworking with you know these reallyexcitingum natural materials it's almost likefor too long we've been trying tocontrol themin in technical systems andand i think you know going back to thatpoint that you were making about thislow tech and high tech is thatthe low tech and the high techapproaches are completely fused togetherwhat's really exciting about whatcaroline was sayingyou kind of give it a structure or youyou experiment with it and you see howyou canyou know nurture it but also then allowit to take its own formthen you know the results are unexpectedand incredibleand i think what you were alluding tosamuel this kind ofincreased acceptance that you knowperfection and we always talk about thefuture is not white and shinyyou see that a lot in like the um theshow drifters it's not it doesn't lookas desirable as you can seehere you can see the imperfections ofthe materialbut i think what was great about darylwhat he did is really embrace thosequalitiesand he kind of leaned on thoseimperfections and i think it workedreally well with this shoeand it's been really well received butnone would normally be considered thatto be luxurious but i feel like we arechallengingwhat is luxury what is like desirabledoes itcan we change it can we alter it in someway and challenge thoseum ideas and those aesthetics maybeluxury is likebeing able to to see how something hasbeen madeor where it's come from or the fact thatit's had a previous life i think if wecan get to the pointthat it's really aspirational forsomething tohave had a previous existence and foryou to be able to almostinstantly see that or feel that or thatstory to be told i think that'sreally exciting this idea of you knowa a gust of wind hitting paper and ashiny object is created at any meanspossible that's completely gone which isvery positive and so good it's reallynow at this point designsultimatum and modus operandi is reallyto actually servethe living environment and thus beingpart of that environment versus anythingelseamazing to get a glimpse into the futurewith that group now we'll bring injoni and jacob who have worked on somefascinating projects for nsrl recentlyso without further ado i want to let youtwo both go ahead and introduce usto what nsrl is yeah so the nsrlis stands for the nike sports researchlab and it's really like thisworld-class research facility thathouses boththese really awesome researchers andthis really sophisticated equipmentthat allow us to deliver provenscientificinsights that help drive productinnovation across the across the companyeverything really starts with the voiceof the athlete and that's what we'rereally trying to celebrate herein addition to what we're capable of ifwe work together as a collective butit'd be brilliantnow of course to move into the productitselfthe name of the product some of thematerials in involved in all of thosedecisions um surrounding the product sowe started froma known athlete problem something thatwe talk about through the lens of likethis cold weather running conundrum sothis idea that it's reallynot feasible or easy to dress in a waywhere you're going to be comfortablethroughout your entire workout so to beable to solve that issue on our endknowing what the problem is you reallyhave to understand how dynamicthose insulation needs are from theathlete perspectivewe went through this process where weevaluated runnersat different temperatures um and like isaid we really worked to quantifywhat that dynamic insulation curvelooked like this is where we intersectedwith jake's team they were looking at asimilarathlete problem they had a jacket thatthey were working onjust to add a little bit of context tothat from the arc perspectiveor the design perspective we reallywanted to approach design differently interms ofunderstanding the physiology but alsothe psychologybehind the athlete out of that everybodyunanimously just said i want to becomfortableand as we know you know comfort is adifficult thing to quantifyand you know it was very fortuitous thatwhen we partnered with the nsrljoni had implemented some reallyfantastictest methods to essentially quantifycomfort which isa really remarkable thing this is stilljust a step in the right directionand the fact that the nsrl is continuingto quantify and give us targetsfor improvement to make you know theathletes journey that muchbetter or easier or comfortable you knowthat's the direction that we want tocontinue to move inwhen i think about key moments andpoints that we discussedfor episode 2 there are a fewspecifics that come to mind point one isthe future of design is endlessand extraordinary point twomaterials are changing the systems ofdesign and breaking the modpoint three process and intention areincredibly

morning trainee acts after a couple ofmonths of testing I have enoughinformation to be able to confidentlycompare the Nike Vapor fly 4% fly netsto the Nike Pegasus 35 turbo they aretheoretically similar shoes but on paperthere are also really different shoesthey're also both really expensive shoesbut they are the shoes from Nike thatare compared most often so what we'regonna do today is give you a comparisonof the Nike Vapor fly fly net 4% to theNike Pegasus 35 turbo I'm gonna tell youwhich one's worth the money in whichsave your cashola[Music]all right so here we have the Nike Vaporfly flying at 4% here we have the NikePegasus 35 turbo marketed you wouldthink that the vapor fly 4% is the fastrunning shoe the racing flat while thepegasus 35 turbo is like the everydaytrainer I think this is kind of marketedas well you don't want to use this forall of your daily training so why notuse this and get a lot of the benefitsof that 4% for your daily trainingthat's what you think you would getbetween these two what you get that'ssimilar with both of them is a highprice tag the vapor fly 4% two hundredand fifty dollars us the Pegasus 35turbo one hundred and eighty dollarsu.s. so they're both certainly past thatI would say a hundred and fifty dollarsis kind of the end price point for ashoe that is not anymore a daily traineryou're getting into luxury shoes at thatpoint they're also both very light shoesthis is six point seven ounces for amen's size-nine that's a unisex shoe inthis case you would want to size ahalf-size up this shoe is accuratesizing and it comes in at 7.9 ounces sojust slightly heavier but I'd still putit in that racing shoe kind of sub 8ounce category where you're gonna beable to go fast then the weight of thisshoe isn't going to restrict you fromgoing fast so they're fairly similar inthat regard we've got racing shoe weightwise probably racing shoe both of themhave a similar 10 millimeter heel to toedrop whereas on the vapor fly 4% it's athirty nine millimeter heel hugebuilt-up heel and a twenty ninemillimeter forefoot so this is a reallybig stack height you feel like you'rehigh off the ground and this isn't ashoe that you really want to walk aroundin it's not for going to thebecause it's not really comfortable youfeel a little bit tippy until you startrunning around the Pegasus 35 turbo hasthat same 10 millimeter drop from theheel to the toe but in this case it's a28 millimeter heel and a 15 millimeterforefoot now this is much morecomfortable to walk around in this islike a daily trainer this is like adaily running shoe you can go to the gymin this you can do weight liftingworkouts in this you can walk around andjust travel throughout the day in this Ispent a day in this walking around whileI was down in California last weektotally comfortable where the marketingcomes into this is let's just focus onthe 4% for a second it was thought thatthe carbon-fiber insole that causes thisto be a really stiff shoe is what causedyou to spring forward and was the secretsauce of this shoe what's been found isthat it's actually the interactionbetween the carbon fiber in Seoul andthe sandwiched on top and bottom of thatcarbon fiber insole zoom X phone nowthat zoom X phone is the most responsivethe springiest foam and lightest foamthat you can put into a shoe but thedownside to that is that it's also theleast durable foam it collapses thequickest so this typically thought to beabout a hundred-mile shoe and then itstarts wearing out the marketing to thisshoe is that it is that same zoomx foamso here we have a shoe that is marketedas being sort of like your daily trainerget a lot of the benefits and theresponsiveness of this vapor fly 4% butjust get it in a lower price point andget it in a shoe that you can use day inand day out but you've got the foam thatis the least durable in the world soyou're going to all of a sudden bebuying a daily trainer that isn't goingto last very long not a great thing inaddition to that this pegasus 35 turboalso doesn't have that carbon fiberinsole and whatI mentioned is that the secret sauce -this isn't the carbon-fibre in Seoulisn't the zoom axe film itself it's thecombination of how they work togetherand in this case all you're getting isthat not very durable foam at a veryhigh price point they both have rubberon the outsole there's just a little bitmore here on the pegasus 35 turbo andwhat i find is that the vapor fly 4% itgets kind of slippery as soon as there'sa little bit of condensation on theground this kind of loses its tractionthis really really good for traction soa lot more like an everyday trainerwhere you feel stable on the ground thevapor fly 4% is very light verybreathable it's not a nice mesh justlike a really minimal upper without alot to it this is much more structuredfair bit heavier the heel cup is moresubstantial a lot more structure herethat you're going to be locked intoplace the tongue is really thick on thepegasus 35 turbo there is no tongue onthe fly net 4 percent pure racing shoemore like an everyday trainer as far ashow they function that's what you wantto know are you going to get what youpay for in the case of the vapor fly 4percent you're going to get probably thesingle best until the next percentbecomes available the single best racingflat out there I've heard of races where60 to 70 percent of the athletes in thetriathlon are actually wearing this it'slegit studies have shown it you get whatyou pay for for $250 if you want thefastest shoe that you can possibly getand you have the speed to use it andwe're talking somewhere under about anine minute mile or so you are gonna seea lot of benefit from this this shoeit's going to be fast it's going to belight it's not going to have that sameresponsive feeling however because itdoesn't have that carbon fiber insolesandwiched in there so as far as aracing flat goes if you're spending 180why not spend the extra seventy dollarsand get something that is designed to gofast and has been proven to have thatsecret sauce of the carbon fiber insolemixed with the zoo max foam here you'vegot nice light zoomx foam that is fairlyresponsive but it's marketed it as aneveryday trainer so if it's an everydaytrainer you're buying one of the mostexpensive everyday trainers on a dollarper mile basis because it's a hundredand eighty bucks it has the zoomx foamthat's not gonna last very long then itkind of gets pigeon-holed into a roadracing flat in which case we get back towhy not buy the best road racing flatout there which is this so I don'treally know how this shoe is intended toslot into the entire lineup of the Nikeproduct line I think it's a great shoe Ienjoy running in it I probably run inthis shoe more than any other shoe thatI have the thing is I can't justifyspending a hundred and eighty dollarsfor a shoe that's only going to lastabout a hundred miles I can justify itin this because it's not intended to bea high mileage shoe this is marketedmore as a high mileage shoe but itdoesn't quite serve that purpose now ifyou're looking at this in comparison tothe Nike Pegasus itself not the NikePegasus 35 turbo you can actually get asimilar shoe for fifty dollars that'sbeen marked down from 120 down to 50 andI think what's happening with that shoewith this shoe even though they'reentirely different shoes is Nike

they're both certainly past thatI would say a hundred and fifty dollarsis kind of the end price point for ashoe that is not anymore a daily traineryou're getting into luxury shoes at thatpoint they're also both very light shoesthis is six point seven ounces for amen's size-nine that's a unisex shoe inthis case you would want to size ahalf-size up this shoe is accuratesizing and it comes in at 7.9 ounces sojust slightly heavier but I'd still putit in that racing shoe kind of sub 8ounce category where you're gonna beable to go fast then the weight of thisshoe isn't going to restrict you fromgoing fast so they're fairly similar inthat regard we've got racing shoe weightwise probably racing shoe both of themhave a similar 10 millimeter heel to toedrop whereas on the vapor fly 4% it's athirty nine millimeter heel hugebuilt-up heel and a twenty ninemillimeter forefoot so this is a reallybig stack height you feel like you'rehigh off the ground and this isn't ashoe that you really want to walk aroundin it's not for going to thebecause it's not really comfortable youfeel a little bit tippy until you startrunning around the Pegasus 35 turbo hasthat same 10 millimeter drop from theheel to the toe but in this case it's a28 millimeter heel and a 15 millimeterforefoot now this is much morecomfortable to walk around in this islike a daily trainer this is like adaily running shoe you can go to the gymin this you can do weight liftingworkouts in this you can walk around andjust travel throughout the day in this Ispent a day in this walking around whileI was down in California last weektotally comfortable where the marketingcomes into this is let's just focus onthe 4% for a second it was thought thatthe carbon-fiber insole that causes thisto be a really stiff shoe is what causedyou to spring forward and was the secretsauce of this shoe what's been found isthat it's actually the interactionbetween the carbon fiber in Seoul andthe sandwiched on top and bottom of thatcarbon fiber insole zoom X phone nowthat zoom X phone is the most responsivethe springiest foam and lightest foamthat you can put into a shoe but thedownside to that is that it's also theleast durable foam it collapses thequickest so this typically thought to beabout a hundred-mile shoe and then itstarts wearing out the marketing to thisshoe is that it is that same zoomx foamso here we have a shoe that is marketedas being sort of like your daily trainerget a lot of the benefits and theresponsiveness of this vapor fly 4% butjust get it in a lower price point andget it in a shoe that you can use day inand day out but you've got the foam thatis the least durable in the world soyou're going to all of a sudden bebuying a daily trainer that isn't goingto last very long not a great thing inaddition to that this pegasus 35 turboalso doesn't have that carbon fiberinsole and whatI mentioned is that the secret sauce -this isn't the carbon-fibre in Seoulisn't the zoom axe film itself it's thecombination of how they work togetherand in this case all you're getting isthat not very durable foam at a veryhigh price point they both have rubberon the outsole there's just a little bitmore here on the pegasus 35 turbo andwhat i find is that the vapor fly 4% itgets kind of slippery as soon as there'sa little bit of condensation on theground this kind of loses its tractionthis really really good for traction soa lot more like an everyday trainerwhere you feel stable on the ground thevapor fly 4% is very light verybreathable it's not a nice mesh justlike a really minimal upper without alot to it this is much more structuredfair bit heavier the heel cup is moresubstantial a lot more structure herethat you're going to be locked intoplace the tongue is really thick on thepegasus 35 turbo there is no tongue onthe fly net 4 percent pure racing shoemore like an everyday trainer as far ashow they function that's what you wantto know are you going to get what youpay for in the case of the vapor fly 4percent you're going to get probably thesingle best until the next percentbecomes available the single best racingflat out there I've heard of races where60 to 70 percent of the athletes in thetriathlon are actually wearing this it'slegit studies have shown it you get whatyou pay for for $250 if you want thefastest shoe that you can possibly getand you have the speed to use it andwe're talking somewhere under about anine minute mile or so you are gonna seea lot of benefit from this this shoeit's going to be fast it's going to belight it's not going to have that sameresponsive feeling however because itdoesn't have that carbon fiber insolesandwiched in there so as far as aracing flat goes if you're spending 180why not spend the extra seventy dollarsand get something that is designed to gofast and has been proven to have thatsecret sauce of the carbon fiber insolemixed with the zoo max foam here you'vegot nice light zoomx foam that is fairlyresponsive but it's marketed it as aneveryday trainer so if it's an everydaytrainer you're buying one of the mostexpensive everyday trainers on a dollarper mile basis because it's a hundredand eighty bucks it has the zoomx foamthat's not gonna last very long then itkind of gets pigeon-holed into a roadracing flat in which case we get back towhy not buy the best road racing flatout there which is this so I don'treally know how this shoe is intended toslot into the entire lineup of the Nikeproduct line I think it's a great shoe Ienjoy running in it I probably run inthis shoe more than any other shoe thatI have the thing is I can't justifyspending a hundred and eighty dollarsfor a shoe that's only going to lastabout a hundred miles I can justify itin this because it's not intended to bea high mileage shoe this is marketedmore as a high mileage shoe but itdoesn't quite serve that purpose now ifyou're looking at this in comparison tothe Nike Pegasus itself not the NikePegasus 35 turbo you can actually get asimilar shoe for fifty dollars that'sbeen marked down from 120 down to 50 andI think what's happening with that shoewith this shoe even though they'reentirely different shoes is Nike istrying to find a mix that appeals to theperson that's buying the everydaytrainer they've nailed this shoe stillhave yet to find it with this oneso which shoe do I recommend and on thescale of like zero to five trainee actsMiley heads where zero is don't eventhink about buying it and a five aseveryone should buy it I gave this shoeI think a zero or one in the reviewthat I just posted of this because allthe reasons that I said don't like itthis shoe here I think in my review Igave it a 3 out of 5 because it does thefunction that it's supposed to it'sexpensive but it is exactly what you arepaying for the thing about it thatcauses me to not give it a 4 or a 5 kindof rating is because it's not a shoethat's going to appeal to everyone noteveryone is under 9 minutes per milewhere they're going to see a massivebenefit from this not everyone is goingto want to spend $250 on this and it'san incremental benefit it's not likegoing and buying a pair of clip-on arrowbars to a road bike where you're goingto see a significant benefit you'regoing to see a small benefit certainlyyou will see it but not everyone willsee it and not everyone really means itso that is my coverage so far of thenike vapor fly 4% fly net versus thepegasus 35 turbo now I am on the list toget the nike next percent which is theupdated version of this which apparentlyis even more ludicrous how much fasterit is

chaptercelebrating his time with the nationalteam and actually even on the rightinsole I don't know if the light hits ifyou can see anything but it says that heis the all-time top scorer and the mostcapped player for the Portuguesenational team like like I said it's onlyon the right one okay yeah he got thenice first impression like you said I Iwasn't too keen on the Callaway it ishowevergrowing on me as we speak and what I dolike is that compared to the a lot ofthe previous cr7 editions it actuallydoesn't really say see are same yes yeshowever you have it on the on the pooltongue you can easily block that outyes that's turning you off aha yesseriously but if your name starts with aC for example it could be a pretty niceyou know thing because for me thebiggest turnoff in the old cr7 boots hasalways been the humongous cr7 twins yeson the boots so what I actually do likethat it only says C I'm fully with youman I'm fully with youbecause now you can actually like thisboot is I'm not even kiddingto me this is still the best lookingHolloway off the cr7 chapter but thisman like if it's a Joel turn on thisshiny bling I'm all game you would bethe only one who would wedding andthat's the problem with having your namesplashed all over your signature bootsunless if your er7 was my you know mylife and my favorite player and I wouldyou know be proud to rock his boots Ithink this would be cool that is whatI'm a bit too much for me you knowthat's what I mean especially at leastonce yeah I know if they've kind oftoned it down but I think that's reallyreally cool on a new one that it'sactually acceptable for even you knowshould we say all the people who perhapsdon't want to wear cristiano boots thatthey can actually they can actually rockit and even if your name doesn't startwith the C if you're the captain you'regonna say I like I like them actually Ithink you know the fact that they havethe golden and look the fact that theyalso took the swoosh and placed it likethey have it on the old super flies Ithink it's a tad bit cooler on theSuperfly six than it is on with in withthe new switch placement on the told thesmall swoosh I think it was kind of cooland I still think that you know it's notmy favorite color of all time no but itis in my opinion pretty easywe're because it is like a slightly darkHalloween I agree with dark booths tendto be very like you know kind of easy towearyes like you know this deal is gonnajust blend in and look cool no I knowand the fact that they used you know thethe whole gradual shift from the greento the black the fact that the sock isblack you can mix it with a lot becauseit has a black sock if it happened greenit would be very much in your face ofexactly but this is like a in a way it'sit's a pretty subtle boot in my opinionI you know it's not like a strikingcolor way back to this I mean or evenyou know that one or what else do wehave of this work which I also think thesavage community oh this this is you ohit is it is but yeah it's like you knowto me like in all honesty like I feellike maybe the cr7 like chapters it's alittle bit like you know you know whaton like you know they should have keptit at like fine but you know what I meanlike you know yes I feel like the hypeis starting to die a little bit yes whoboots and always lovely to see a newcolor ways you know who can complainabout that but like kind of yeah yeahit's like there's just so many of themand now we also gave me they could havelike you knowemerged and mixed some of the storiestogether like instead of like maybe likeimagine they could have put like theMadeira and the Euro boots together inone you have like two stories in thesame boot uh-huh you know if you knowwhat I mean like yeah but I just feellike it's maybe going no I guess westill have one more coming up after thisand the thing is that he hadn't won theeuros by the time animated movie butthat's a whole other discussion but Ithink you're right that that I thinkit's good that it's kind of coming to aclose because we have seenand you know okay the hype around cr7 itisn't dying the man still banging in thegoals I mean are you kidding me did yousee him in the weekend yepyeah it's funny because I saw some statslike in the was it like late August hehad five goalsyes season and miss he had like 50 noseyes and now Ronaldo has actually moregoals this is no mercy yeah so you knowand that's just something we have tolearn but never ride only yeahnever ride off cr7 and and you know Ialso think that once we progress as Isaid it's been going on me when I sawfor the first time I was like oh no youdidn't like it but looking at it andseeing how especially how the plate kindof fades with the food I like that thatit kind of goes from the shiny at firstin the beginning are we with the wholeyou know usual should comply sixpearlescent stuff which looks at likecool you got you just gotta you gottagive it to me it always looks good italways looks good mess with them or youknow how the how the blue wraps on thefoot I think this is perhaps the likethe best execution where they actuallyhave some sort of graphic underneath thefoot on the on the Superfly six and thenthe black plane which I think youshouldn't underestimate that I'm not ablack on the islands for the superfineyou know add some nice contrast to theboard again gives it a little bit of adarker theme no overall along with thesocket let me just uh let me just getthe only thing I wish is like I saidlike I feel like you know now when youget the chassis are seven chapters likeit doesn't really hit you that hardyeah so I honestly I hope that for thelast one I haven't seen at least youknow I hope that they do something likeyou know the what to make Miss Mercurioya know like they go all in and make itlike really custom yeah Nike that's whatI hope because then people will be likeokay guys that was a sick we got it theygotta end it on a high yes because youknow obviously you know the chapter fivewas decent I mean itbut then you know it's perhaps it's alsobecause they release all of thesespecial models then they made the Mayowhich basically this is like achrome-plated kind of like they'rerunning a bit out of ideas and and allyou just go like you know nuts you knowthrow out the rule book yes I don't knowwhat they can do they probably alreadyhave a good plan now but but I gotta saythis is a fresh a fresh idea Holloway wehaven't seen before this mint but yeahocean mint is a brilliant yes oh yeah Ithink and and you know it's it's abeautiful color it mixes well with thegold I always like a bit of gold on mybootsoh nice that it's a bit more accessibleto everyone and I think that's reallyreally good so people can actually wearit and enjoy it and supervise brilliantblue eyeI'm actually pretty positive about thisI I could wear this you know absolutelylike I could wear this I would just takea black marker yl7 and I would be goodto go you know that because it's niceyes and the thing is that this onlyarrives in a superfly version becauseobviously cr7 ways to Superfly so if youwanted you're gonna have to live withthe fact that it's a super fly but itdoesn't matter because the super fly isactually almost as good as a vapor in myopinion it's more likely it'll feelbetter yeah yeah it's it's just it'ssoft it's got softer than the vapor itis so so yeah I'm happyare you happy I think it's cool you knowbut you know Nike you really need tocome with some heat for the last chapterlike seriously we need to like go crazyor something like we'd like a cot seebullet like you know we need somethingcustom and like something insane thatpeople will just be like ice yo it'sit's all yo yo cr7 like the Buddha needsto be so sick then he can play in thatkala way for the rest of my story yesboom and with those worst jokes I thinkI think it's this time we ended on onthat high and say guys if you want theseboots are there's gonna be a link on theon the screen right now where

hi guys ian from the football boots teamand today in another episode of thefootballshow i'm going to be talking about whyneymar has ended upat humor there are a lot of questions toanswer about this and in this video i'llbe getting into all of the detailsbut first off i want to take a littlestep back and discuss how we got to thispoint so back in 2013neymar was the face of the hypervenomwhen they came outa massively successful boot for nike andthat was when neymar really burst ontothe stages around the time of his moveto barcelona things are going reallywell for him that was kind of the peakperhaps of things with neymar so hestarts off and he's wearing thehypervenoms very successful with thelaunchthey move on he goes to the 2014 worldcup and he got his ownspecial edition golden dreams so thosewere thegold uh boot yellow sole and it was allbased on the inspiration of he used tospray his boots goldwhen he was a kid these are fantastic umreleases they were just a specialeditionand he didn't really get to wear them ithink he maybe got a half in them orsomething and obviously got his backinjury at the tournament so moving on hecarried on wearing the hypervenoms heloved the hypervenoms a lot of peoplekind of now think they're a boot thedecadethey um that kind of grippy upperneymar's a big fan of them now rememberthese are with the low collar that'llget more importantas we get on in this episode um so hemoved on from those he then went on towear the liquid dreamsnow the liquid dreams were a silverversion a signature editionfor uh neymar and they were silverversion pretty much of the golden dreamsbut they did have this pinkaccent to them and that's going to beimportant as well he went on and it gotto the point that that was kind of thelastish pair that he wore of the originalhypervenomsthen they changed into the hypervenomtwos and this is where things started toget a little bitdownhill for the relationship perhapsbetween nike andneymar now some of the things i say inthis video are going to be my opinionsthey're not necessarily factsjust what i think about it so i don'twant to get myself into trouble withnike or with neymarbut i'm going to tell you how i see itand how i interpret what happens soneymar is wearing the hypervenom twosthese are now the oneswith the collar on them he doesn't likethem as much as he likedthe original boots it doesn't really geton with them as muchover time nike then released a new upperas kind of upgrade to the upper to tryand solve some of the problems whichreally took us backto a more similar upper they also hadthe finish available which was the lowversion neymar would be seen wearingthose a little bitso those type of venom twos this is whenwe started to see the collabbetween jordan and neymar and these aresome of the bestkind of collab boots that we've seen theproblem is is neymarstill doesn't like the hypervenom atthis point and he doesn't really likewearing them somuch in fact that they bought out ablack pair and a white pair and ibelieve the black oneshe was just seen wearing the finishedversion he wasn't wearing the ones withthe collarbut the main problem wasn't just thecollar on there he didn't like that butalsothe upper it just didn't suit him so hewants to wear the vaporsand so he actually gets nike to make hima pair of vaporsthat are disguised to look like thehypervenoms that he's supposed to bemarketingso you might have heard about thisbefore but in essence the boots when yousee them close up you can tell thatthey're a pair of mercurial vaporsbut they've been painted up and designedto look like the hypervenoms that he'sactually marketingso there is a real big kind of issuenike tried to work it out by making themlook like what is marketing but it's abig problem when your player doesn'tlikethe boots that he's being paid to wearso eventually neymar manages to gethimself out of the hypervenomshypervenom moves on to the hypervenomthrees it's not an amal thingneymar is in the vapors and nike takethat on board and they decide to makehim kind of the big face of the vapoursbut this is where the problem is is thatthe vapor isn't really nike's high-endoffering in the mercurial linethey're all ways trying to put peopleinto the superflyso with this superfly you've got thelikes of ronaldo in themyou've got vape in them and you've nowgot sancho in them as wellthat is their elite offering and thevapor is underneath it so it's a bit ofa problemwhen you've got one of your headlineplayers wanting to wear that boot thatisunderneath but nike went with it andthey created the written in the starsvapers for himnow those ones were based on hisachievements with brazil they're kind ofa blueboot uh star details on them and they'reactually very nice kind of signatureedition for himmoving on when we got to the 2018 worldcup that was whenneymar got his mo jogo boots they were apair of yellow boots amarilloand he got to wear those in action atthe world cup that was a troublesomeworld cup for him everybody was justsuggesting that he was diving androlling over and things like that so itwasn't really great for himwith the kind of pr thing perhaps hejust took another little bit of a hitto his profile as a big star playermoving on nike would give him the vaporsthe vapor 12sthey'd also then give him his speedfreaks and then they would go on fromthat into the last ones that we've seenum the white ones with all the differentneymar logos on it now there's been alot of changes in the nomar logothey've never managed to stick to onething which is a little bit confusingbut it's going to be useful for pumabecause it's anotheranother new logo for neymar he's gone topumaand he's going to get this new logo sothe thing ishe actually had a year left on hiscontract with nike so i'm not surewhat's happened there whether it's gotpaid upum or they've just torn it up or whatthe thing was but neymarisn't getting the position that he wantsto have with nikeso mbappe his teammate at psghe's a bigger deal now to nike thanneymar isand bappe's won the world cup andbappy's got to the final of thechampions leagueobviously neymar was there as well butneymar is playing second fiddle tombappe in the psg team and he doesn'twant to play second fiddle to himat nike so it's a case of well maybehe'll go back to barcelona or somethinglike thatmy question would be is if he goes backto barcelona how is that relationshipbut puma gonna be with griezmann he'sthe headline player with the ultrasnow talking about the ultras we haven'tseen neymar movedirectly into wearing the ultra straightaway i think everybody was expecting tosee that when they hear that he's gonnago to puma it's like okay well he'sgonna be in the ultrasand i think pure have done really wellby putting him in the puma kingsand having this whole the king is backthing i think it's a great bit ofmarketing it's a great bit of stuffthat's pushing people to noticethe puma king platinums now lukaku atinter milan has been banging in thegoalswearing those boots not sure what he'sgoing to be wearing this season but he'sgot a lot of goals wearing those bootsand it's just great to see them on thepitch now the boots that you've seenneymar wearingthey're not actually available at retailand it just seems like they've had torush this out it seems to have beenquite a quick decisionand one of the things and i've got thislittle bit of a kind of inside thoughtthat i'll give you in a secondbut one of the things it seems to berushed out because they've had to getsilny art to come along and there's theblackoutboots and he's whited out the swoosh ofthe little swords the form stripe onthereso then you can see that really standout on pitch and then added on theneymar logo as welland you can see all these custom bootsthey were all blackouts and he'd addedthe white paint to them to be wornso there hasn't actually been any timeto get anything specifically set up forneighbor neymar now talking aboutspecifically set up and talking aboutthose liquid diamonds that i talkedabout before if you see the pink on theswooshon the phantom gts now when nike bringout a new bootthey normally have a headline wearer ican't saythat i can think of anybody who wasreally the headline wearerwhen the phantom gts came out now theycould have used kevin de bruynethey could have used kai hubbards theycould have used lewandowskii mean lowendasies had a mad season ifthey could have got him into those bootsum then he would be in a great kind ofheadline wearer for it they could haveused harry kane who was the headlinewearerfor the phantom venoms now i understandthat kopit 19's been around and it'smade it harder for them to getmarketing materials and things set upbut i just have a suspicionthat nike planned on having neymarheadlinethe phantom gts and this is the kind ofinside kind ofthought that i've got about what's goingon i think that neymar was supposed tofront these boots i thinkthat the way that these are set up itjust reminds me of what they've donewith neymar before and i think neymarwas supposed tofront the phantom gts you will have seenthat neymar did wear the phantom gtsin blackout in training earlier in theyear so they're giving them a goremember that these are on thehypervenom last so that meansthat the way the the sole of the boot isdesigned it is the sameso it's designed to suit the boot thatname our lightyes it comes with a collar it also comeswith the low so it would have made sensethat perhaps they would have been happyfor neymar to wear the low versionand just give him some white socks orsomething to make it look like he waswearing the hibut the other thing is i believe thatnike planned on havinga signature edition phantom gt forneymarit would have come out in the nextmonths or so i believeclearly that's not going to happenanymore but i believe that nike wantedto get neymar into the phantom gts theystill wanted him aroundbut they wanted him to headline theseobviously he's tried themand he's decided he wanted to stick tothat kind of vapor feel of a boothe didn't want to come and use theseboots and it's come to a headand he said you know what i don't wantto carry on and then he's gone to pumathey've had a conversation they'veobviously worked out the money and allthose kind of thingsand he's also getting that recognitionthat he's just not gettingif he goes to puma he's their nightnumber one number two playergriezmann and neymar that's all there isfor puma other playersa little bit further down the lineyou're not talking about um your balletsor james madison'sor players like that even marco royceplayers like that they're just not quitethatelite level when you look at nikethey've got a lot of elite level playersso they've got ronaldo they've gotmbappe they've got sancho to headlinethe mercurialsthey can now just take the vapor and sayyou know what it's just that littlenotchbelow again they can carry on with themarketing their way the way the way theywere beforeobviously it's a slight issue a slightvacuum in what they're doing with thephantom gts but i say come on getlewandowski in them as soon as possiblehe is clearly the headline player forthose he should have won the bang ondoor this yearthe guy won everything possible in thiscalendar yearhe was the top goal scorer in all thosecompetitions and they've taken theballon d'or away from him and i thinkthat's a crying shame because heabsolutely deservesto have won that um and then obviouslyharry kane and a few other players likede bruyne and kylie hubbard now he's atchelsea he's going to stand out a bitmore probablythey're going to be the players thatyou're going to see with the phantom gtsbut i do think that nike originallyplannedto have neymar in them and i think hewas having none of it and i think nowhe's gone to the puma kings how long helasting the puma kings i will besurprised to seei think maybe maybe we'll see a specialedition of the ultras or something maybea super light version or somethingmaybe they'll even tie in and make it aneymar edition but they are going to tryand get himinto those as soon as possible i am surebut it will be interesting to seewhether he likes the design of those itis a lot wider in the forefoot but havea think about itand see what you think neymar i supposehe's got time and um he's gonna have alittle bit of rest seeing as he's gothimself sent offuh in his first game wearing the pumakings right guys uh thank you very muchfor watching please let me know what youthink about neymar and his boot switchwould be interesting one to followthanks for watching go enjoy football,20,UCJprx3bX49vNl6Bcw01Cwfg,T1,503,50,0,6435,"['SKT T1', 'T1', 'Faker', 'Effort', 'khan', 'crazy', 'clid', 'haru',

hi guys ian from the football boots teamand today in another episode of thefootballshow i'm going to be talking about whyneymar has ended upat humor there are a lot of questions toanswer about this and in this video i'llbe getting into all of the detailsbut first off i want to take a littlestep back and discuss how we got to thispoint so back in 2013neymar was the face of the hypervenomwhen they came outa massively successful boot for nike andthat was when neymar really burst ontothe stages around the time of his moveto barcelona things are going reallywell for him that was kind of the peakperhaps of things with neymar so hestarts off and he's wearing thehypervenoms very successful with thelaunchthey move on he goes to the 2014 worldcup and he got his ownspecial edition golden dreams so thosewere thegold uh boot yellow sole and it was allbased on the inspiration of he used tospray his boots goldwhen he was a kid these are fantastic umreleases they were just a specialeditionand he didn't really get to wear them ithink he maybe got a half in them orsomething and obviously got his backinjury at the tournament so moving on hecarried on wearing the hypervenoms heloved the hypervenoms a lot of peoplekind of now think they're a boot thedecadethey um that kind of grippy upperneymar's a big fan of them now rememberthese are with the low collar that'llget more importantas we get on in this episode um so hemoved on from those he then went on towear the liquid dreamsnow the liquid dreams were a silverversion a signature editionfor uh neymar and they were silverversion pretty much of the golden dreamsbut they did have this pinkaccent to them and that's going to beimportant as well he went on and it gotto the point that that was kind of thelastish pair that he wore of the originalhypervenomsthen they changed into the hypervenomtwos and this is where things started toget a little bitdownhill for the relationship perhapsbetween nike andneymar now some of the things i say inthis video are going to be my opinionsthey're not necessarily factsjust what i think about it so i don'twant to get myself into trouble withnike or with neymarbut i'm going to tell you how i see itand how i interpret what happens soneymar is wearing the hypervenom twosthese are now the oneswith the collar on them he doesn't likethem as much as he likedthe original boots it doesn't really geton with them as muchover time nike then released a new upperas kind of upgrade to the upper to tryand solve some of the problems whichreally took us backto a more similar upper they also hadthe finish available which was the lowversion neymar would be seen wearingthose a little bitso those type of venom twos this is whenwe started to see the collabbetween jordan and neymar and these aresome of the bestkind of collab boots that we've seen theproblem is is neymarstill doesn't like the hypervenom atthis point and he doesn't really likewearing them somuch in fact that they bought out ablack pair and a white pair and ibelieve the black oneshe was just seen wearing the finishedversion he wasn't wearing the ones withthe collarbut the main problem wasn't just thecollar on there he didn't like that butalsothe upper it just didn't suit him so hewants to wear the vaporsand so he actually gets nike to make hima pair of vaporsthat are disguised to look like thehypervenoms that he's supposed to bemarketingso you might have heard about thisbefore but in essence the boots when yousee them close up you can tell thatthey're a pair of mercurial vaporsbut they've been painted up and designedto look like the hypervenoms that he'sactually marketingso there is a real big kind of issuenike tried to work it out by making themlook like what is marketing but it's abig problem when your player doesn'tlikethe boots that he's being paid to wearso eventually neymar manages to gethimself out of the hypervenomshypervenom moves on to the hypervenomthrees it's not an amal thingneymar is in the vapors and nike takethat on board and they decide to makehim kind of the big face of the vapoursbut this is where the problem is is thatthe vapor isn't really nike's high-endoffering in the mercurial linethey're all ways trying to put peopleinto the superflyso with this superfly you've got thelikes of ronaldo in themyou've got vape in them and you've nowgot sancho in them as wellthat is their elite offering and thevapor is underneath it so it's a bit ofa problemwhen you've got one of your headlineplayers wanting to wear that boot thatisunderneath but nike went with it andthey created the written in the starsvapers for himnow those ones were based on hisachievements with brazil they're kind ofa blueboot uh star details on them and they'reactually very nice kind of signatureedition for himmoving on when we got to the 2018 worldcup that was whenneymar got his mo jogo boots they were apair of yellow boots amarilloand he got to wear those in action atthe world cup that was a troublesomeworld cup for him everybody was justsuggesting that he was diving androlling over and things like that so itwasn't really great for himwith the kind of pr thing perhaps hejust took another little bit of a hitto his profile as a big star playermoving on nike would give him the vaporsthe vapor 12sthey'd also then give him his speedfreaks and then they would go on fromthat into the last ones that we've seenum the white ones with all the differentneymar logos on it now there's been alot of changes in the nomar logothey've never managed to stick to onething which is a little bit confusingbut it's going to be useful for pumabecause it's anotheranother new logo for neymar he's gone topumaand he's going to get this new logo sothe thing ishe actually had a year left on hiscontract with nike so i'm not surewhat's happened there whether it's gotpaid upum or they've just torn it up or whatthe thing was but neymarisn't getting the position that he wantsto have with nikeso mbappe his teammate at psghe's a bigger deal now to nike thanneymar isand bappe's won the world cup andbappy's got to the final of thechampions leagueobviously neymar was there as well butneymar is playing second fiddle tombappe in the psg team and he doesn'twant to play second fiddle to himat nike so it's a case of well maybehe'll go back to barcelona or somethinglike thatmy question would be is if he goes backto barcelona how is that relationshipbut puma gonna be with griezmann he'sthe headline player with the ultrasnow talking about the ultras we haven'tseen neymar movedirectly into wearing the ultra straightaway i think everybody was expecting tosee that when they hear that he's gonnago to puma it's like okay well he'sgonna be in the ultrasand i think pure have done really wellby putting him in the puma kingsand having this whole the king is backthing i think it's a great bit ofmarketing it's a great bit of stuffthat's pushing people to noticethe puma king platinums now lukaku atinter milan has been banging in thegoalswearing those boots not sure what he'sgoing to be wearing this season but he'sgot a lot of goals wearing those bootsand it's just great to see them on thepitch now the boots that you've seenneymar wearingthey're not actually available at retailand it just seems like they've had torush this out it seems to have beenquite a quick decisionand one of the things and i've got thislittle bit of a kind of inside thoughtthat i'll give you in a secondbut one of the things it seems to berushed out because they've had to getsilny art to come along and there's theblackoutboots and he's whited out the swoosh ofthe little swords the form stripe onthereso then you can see that really standout on pitch and then added on theneymar logo as welland you can see all these custom bootsthey were all blackouts and he'd addedthe white paint to them to be wornso there hasn't actually been any timeto get anything specifically set up forneighbor neymar now talking aboutspecifically set up and talking aboutthose liquid diamonds that i talkedabout before if you see the pink on theswooshon the phantom gts now when nike bringout a new bootthey normally have a headline wearer ican't saythat i can think of anybody who wasreally the headline wearerwhen the phantom gts came out now theycould have used kevin de bruynethey could have used kai hubbards theycould have used lewandowskii mean lowendasies had a mad season ifthey could have got him into those bootsum then he would be in a great kind ofheadline wearer for it they could haveused harry kane who was the headlinewearerfor the phantom venoms now i understandthat kopit 19's been around and it'smade it harder for them to getmarketing materials and things set upbut i just have a suspicionthat nike planned on having neymarheadlinethe phantom gts and this is the kind ofinside kind ofthought that i've got about what's goingon i think that neymar was supposed tofront these boots i thinkthat the way that these are set up itjust reminds me of what they've donewith neymar before and i think neymarwas supposed tofront the phantom gts you will have seenthat neymar did wear the phantom gtsin blackout in training earlier in theyear so they're giving them a goremember that these are on thehypervenom last so that meansthat the way the the sole of the boot isdesigned it is the sameso it's designed to suit the boot thatname our lightyes it comes with a collar it also comeswith the low so it would have made sensethat perhaps they would have been happyfor neymar to wear the low versionand just give him some white socks orsomething to make it look like he waswearing the hibut the other thing is i believe thatnike planned on havinga signature edition phantom gt forneymarit would have come out in the nextmonths or so i believeclearly that's not going to happenanymore but i believe that nike wantedto get neymar into the phantom gts theystill wanted him aroundbut they wanted him to headline theseobviously he's tried themand he's decided he wanted to stick tothat kind of vapor feel of a boothe didn't want to come and use theseboots and it's come to a headand he said you know what i don't wantto carry on and then he's gone to pumathey've had a conversation they'veobviously worked out the money and allthose kind of thingsand he's also getting that recognitionthat he's just not gettingif he goes to puma he's their nightnumber one number two playergriezmann and neymar that's all there isfor puma other playersa little bit further down the lineyou're not talking about um your balletsor james madison'sor players like that even marco royceplayers like that they're just not quitethatelite level when you look at nikethey've got a lot of elite level playersso they've got ronaldo they've gotmbappe they've got sancho to headlinethe mercurialsthey can now just take the vapor and sayyou know what it's just that littlenotchbelow again they can carry on with themarketing their way the way the way theywere beforeobviously it's a slight issue a slightvacuum in what they're doing with thephantom gts but i say come on getlewandowski in them as soon as possiblehe is clearly the headline player forthose he should have won the bang ondoor this yearthe guy won everything possible in thiscalendar yearhe was the top goal scorer in all thosecompetitions and they've taken theballon d'or away from him and i thinkthat's a crying shame because heabsolutely deservesto have won that um and then obviouslyharry kane and a few other players likede bruyne and kylie hubbard now he's atchelsea he's going to stand out a bitmore probablythey're going to be the players thatyou're going to see with the phantom gtsbut i do think that nike originallyplannedto have neymar in them and i think hewas having none of it and i think nowhe's gone to the puma kings how long helasting the puma kings i will besurprised to seei think maybe maybe we'll see a specialedition of the ultras or something maybea super light version or somethingmaybe they'll even tie in and make it aneymar edition but they are going to tryand get himinto those as soon as possible i am surebut it will be interesting to seewhether he likes the design of those itis a lot wider in the forefoot but havea think about itand see what you think neymar i supposehe's got time and um he's gonna have alittle bit of rest seeing as he's gothimself sent offuh in his first game wearing the pumakings right guys uh thank you very muchfor watching please let me know what youthink about neymar and his boot switchwould be interesting one to followthanks for watching go enjoy football,24,UCmyjVwYZbp5YPYTUyeopO2g,Pawn Stars,2588,1150,0,38681,"['pawn', 'pawn stars', 'pawn stars episode', 'pawn stars

is sponsored by stadiumgoods it's a really great website to buythose hard to find sneakers or newreleases orpretty much anything when it comes tostyle and they didn't ask me to talkabout this but their website is so mucheasier to navigate and order from andactually receive your order fromcompared to a lot of the other sneakerwebsites out thereand a lot of times people ask how can isupport the channel a great way to dothat is by supporting the sponsorsso if you've got a pair of sneakersyou've been waiting for a reason to buythembuy them from stadium goods it helpssupport them help support the channelandwe're also giving away three pairs ofthese shoes so stay tuned on how to winthem so now let's go over theinformation on these shoes the brand isnike the model is the air force 107lowe's the colorway is white on whitethey're made in vietnam and they retailanywhere from 90 to 130and even up from there depending on ifyou're getting some limited editionstuffand it's saturday and these are a whitesneaker so technically it's a white it'spart of the white sneakers series butnot really part of the minimalist whitesneaker series so we won't reallybe comparing these to the commonprojects and the koyos and olivercabell'sand everything that's going to be comingout in the following saturdays it justhappened to line up perfectlythere's basically two questions that iwant to answer with this videothe first one is what's inside how arethese built what's the different layersin them and the second one is how muchleather is in thisand what is the quality of leatherbecause if you remember to thethe air jordans the mids not a lot ofthis was leather it's surprisinghow little leather was actually in theshoe so we're going to try to answerthat in this video as wellso now let's get to the cuttingdefinitely heard the hiss of the airunit so let's see what's insideokay let's start going through thedifferent layers starting with theoutsole and moving our way upso they also just a typical rubberoutsole it's a cup solewith the stitching around the outsidethat is real stitching you can see ithere on the insideand what's interesting is you've got alittle bit of that structure in the heelthis little x crosshatch argylestructure that's going to give you alittle bit of extra cushioningcompared to the aj ones that don't havethat thenmoving upwards we've got the foam thatsurrounds the air unit and what'sinteresting is this air unit goesprobably three quarters of the way upthe shoe it's going to give you a littlebit morecushioning and it's going to give you alittle bit more of that height and ithink that's a big part of the reasonwhy theseshoes look so clunky and big is there'sso much on the inside herethen moving up we've got the structuredinsolei guess that's what you'd call it thenthe semi-removableinsert which it's not glued in it's moreof like a it's almost like a sticky tapethat holds it in there so you can removeit and put some different orthotics inif you need tothen from there we've got the upperwhich isthere's no leather in the liner it'sjust a fabric liner with some foamand the counter looks like it's just arubber counterand the upper we still don't know aboutso let's tear the rest of this apartand kind of identify which parts areleather and what else is going on insideof hereso[Applause][Applause]okay got it all torn apart andsurprisingly this entire upperalmost all of it is all leather the onlypart that's not leather is the tongueand this is just some fake leather butthat's really surprising becausewhen we did the mid aj ones a lot of thepanels were a fake leatherand this one seems to be all leather andas for the type of leather you can tellit's a chrome tan leather because it'sgot this bluing on the insidewhich is pretty standard you know mostsneakers and shoes are going to be madeout of chrome tan leatherso now i guess the question is what typeof leatherbut before we get to that let's justlook at these other parts so the cupsoleit's crazy how tall this cup sole is andwhat's interesting is when i was tearingthis apartwhere the stitch was sewn on it rippedit stitchinstead of where it was glued togetherso it's really well bonded togetherand then this midsole the air unitmidsoleit's so soft you know and i obviouslyfrom the cutting aspect you heard whenthe air was releasedso under pressure this would be a prettycomfortable midsole and i think that'swhy people love these part of the reasonwhy thisthese are so loved by a lot of people isthey're comfortable and they're stylishand honestly they give you an extra bitof height too which i think a lot ofpeople enjoynow the next question is what type ofleatheris the upper made out of you know whatpart of the cross sectionof the hide is this made from is it madefrom the topportion that has the grain structure init the most sought after stuff thatwe're seeingin the italian brand stuff or is it madefrom that split section that we see alot of timesin a cheaper shoe made

following in the footsteps of thehypervenom won the hypervenom to haslandedit's made for the agile deadly playerand after hours and hours of testingdribble shots and few misses it's timefor my review so let's get down to thenitty gritty apart from the fact thatwell obviously Nike really changedsomething and introduced a dynamic fitcolor compared to the hypervenom onewe've also seen a lot of other changeson the hypervenom - with brand new upperFlywire being introduced to hypervenomand actually also Nike reworking theirsoleplate a little bit even though itdoesn't look like it but more on thatlatermy first reaction when I put on thehypervenom was okay this is a brand newsensation obviously the dynamic thecolor makes a huge impact but it wasvery different to the hypervenom oneon my feet the - and - feels quite a lotdifferent from the hypervenom one mostlybecause of the upper material actuallythe upper construction is a bit morestiff and rigid it doesn't move as muchwith the foot as on the hypervenom onewith just the Nike skin mesh also nicelyreintroduced these here flex grooves youcan see for added flexibility to theupper and also a bit more friction butit's not perfect and still when you bendthe foot the upper has some a bit morestiff movements than I'd likeso it is a bit different from thehypervenom one to be honestso fly wire is a really really bigchange on the hypervenom to because ittakes the food in a complete differentdirection than the hypervenom onebasically the concept is this littlethread going from the base of thesoleplate to the lace hole so when youpull the laces tight it really locksyour foot on the plate to give you themost efficient energy return and youactually feel that from the moment youput the food on the dynamic fit color isa pretty big introduction on thehypervenom soon but fortunately it's notjust another material or magista becauseit's actually bonded with the syntheticupper fortunately though it's in apretty seamless way so you don't reallyfeel the transition from the syntheticto the Flyknit material but what Nikedid with the hypervenom 2 was that theyoffset this seam so you don't reallyfeel any pressure when you move yourjoints or your ankle and that takes awaythe problems with blisters as well whichI'm a big big fan of this is how Nikesyou make it for the future the generalfit is affected by the stiffer upper itis made over the same last you can stillsee it is pretty wide but because theupper doesn't stretch as much as on thehypervenom one you might have a problemif you have a really wide foot size-wiseI'd say go true to size I went with myusual size UK six you're 40 and it wasdead-on perfectperformance has improved a lot in thehypervenom - compared to the firstgeneration because you do get a muchmore locked-in fit it really eliminatesthe annoying thing about the hypervenomone with sliding around in your bootbecause you didn't really have that lockdown and when it comes to protectionalso you do get a thicker upper to takeaway some of this thing when you get atitle the changes on the soleplateactually has a really huge impact on howthe blue feels because although it mightseem like not much has happened with thesame stock configuration Nike actuallywent in and softened up therenylon glass compound a bit to make itmore flexible and you really feel thatwhen you move around because especiallythe forefoot it's a lot more flexibleand moves more naturally with your foottwisting and turning though in thehypervenom - is pretty awesome becauseyou get the conical stats that reallyhelp you move smoothly through theground so I don't really have anyremarks there it does a pretty good jobwith a good energy transfer thanks tothe torsion bar here and also Nike addedthis kind of grippy mat a finish whereyou really feel the friction when youdribble it's not as you know surgicallyprecise as the hypervenom one but it isstill pretty nice to dribble withstriking the ball is actually one of myfavorite areas in the hypervenom tobecause of the performance mesh so themesh when you hit the ball reallycompresses and takes away a lot of thisthing you get the toe box is low andpointy there's no issue in getting underthe ball and I'm all flexing to losethat this way yes the hypervenom to tome is an improvement it's actually acompletely different there's not muchleft of the hypervenom one with thatsaid it is an improvement performancewise it's much much better keeping yourfoot on the plate giving you a moreflexible sole plate and actually givingyou a more seamless fit with the dynamicbit color and the heel is sensational itis gonna scare off some people with themore stiff upper give it a bit of timeget used to the more tight fit and isactually going to perform really wellbut yes it is an improvement after allon the hypervenom one so nike spenttheir time well hypervenom - might be adifferent animal from the hypervenom onebut it's really responsive has a greatstrike zone with a good free feelingheel is it perfect no but what he wantsto do it does damn well and if you likethat strapped in ready to rock feel thehypervenom to is right up there amongthe best it's not all the match,17,UC5SQGzkWyQSW_fe-URgq7xw,Unisport,240,44,0,2312,"['unisport football soccer', 'unisportlife', 'nike', 'hypervenom', 'phantom', 'neymar', 'rooney', 'lewandowski', 'attack', 'deadly agility', 'deceptive nature', 'mercurial', 'magista', 'superfly', 'shot', 'goal', 'freekick', 'amazing', 'skills', 'tricks', 'review', 'soccer', 'boots', 'cleats', 'football', 'collection', 'shoe', 'ronaldo', 'adidas', 'puma']",Nike Hypervenom II Review I Created for Neymar Jr. and all deceptive attackers,W69Vv-Vup9w,143104
[Music]what's going on YouTube should boy freshbe back at it coming off the bench likeIguodala as you can see today noJohnny's no pop VIX over there somewhereworking on a video today what we'regonna be doing is cleaning these Nikeepic reacts as you guys know or may notknow and I could just put these outintroduce them I think it was late lastyear earlier this year in my opinionit's their response to the ultra boostpretty dopes you still don't own a pairthough but we're gonna try to cleanthese up Johnny was wearing these as youcan see trash them looks like somespilled soda and some other stuff onthere but nothing rejuvenator can'thandle so let's get into it guys so toclean these bad boys today what we'regoing to be doing it uses massiveinators three brush laundry kits so inthe kit as you already know you may notknow I don't know why I keep saying thattoday in the kit you're gonna get yourfour ounce solution your laundry bag -such as few trees I know I only got oneout here but we're only cleaning oneshoe so that's all we need you're gonnaget your all-purpose brush your softbristle brush and your stiff bristlebrush so let's get into this cleaningguys first thing you're gonna want to doadjust your shoot trees to size peoplealways ask about this how do we knowwhat size or what hole to go on we kindof cheat measure it beforehand just soit's perfect every take but for this oneit's a size 11 I think I'm gonna cleanthe left shoe todayso hop this in as you can see put theshoe tree in there so you can do extrapressure on this toe box especially withthe fly knit material we're gonna setthis guy to the side next thing we'regonna do unlace these bad boys I knowthat's a Johnny and pops his favoritestep because they always seem to forgetto do itfinally got these laces out like I saidI don't own a pair of these but thelacing system nike put on the Tingsdifficult as hell just put these lacesout so now that we got the laces outnext step put them to the side whatwe're gonna do take our solution ourbowl of water so take our solutioncouple of squirts into the bowl so wegot the solution squirted into the bowlwe're going to start with our softbristle brush because this is a planetmaterial you want to dip your brush intoyour solution just start attacking allthese stains up here as you can see I'mnot sure what it was that Johnny spilledin this it looks like there's some dirtoil something definitely some soda onthe midsole and outsole because it'spretty sticky[Music]although we put the shoe tree in anotherthing I like to do and I think mostpeople that I find when they're cleaningwill stick their hand in there and theother thing that that does is for areaslike this when I'm putting pressure yourhand is there with the firm the firmnessof your hand that I should say willallow you to put more pressure on someof these upper areas so now that we'vefinished up with our soft bristle brushshake off any liquid off of that I'mgonna switch to our all-purpose this isthe new all-purpose that comes in ourlaundry kits the bristles are softer onthis one than our old all-purpose sowith this I'm gonna clean up themissile's a little bit but not too muchthat's what I'm gonna save this stiffbristle brush for but I'm gonna hit upthough the uppers again because there'sa few small areas especially with thiscounter right here the hill counterthat's on here's a little extra dirtysmall hit it up with the all-purpose solet's just get into that[Music]so with the all-purpose the bristles arestill a little bit stiffer than the thanthe soft bristle brush so you do want tobe careful as you can see I'm not doinga lot of pressure when I'm brushing I'mjust lightly going over it you just wantto be careful not to snag your materialnot saying that it will but it couldpotentially do that you just want to usesome caution when brushing with theall-purpose on any knitted material sonow that I finished up attacking thosetougher stains we're gonna wrap it upwith the all-purpose you could clean themidsole with this but since I'm going toclean the outsole also we're gonna moveon to the stiff bristle brush so nowthat we got our stiff bristle brushlet's attack these missiles and outsolesthis is a foam entire foam midsole Iknow it's supposed to be softer thanlunar but it doesn't seem to be too badyou do want to be careful when usingstiff bristle brushes if it has anypaint or it's a painted midsole you wantto exercise caution or not even do it atall just for sake of not damaging thepaint job we have had some instances ofthe paint messing up so that's just acautionary tale be careful with thestiff bristle when doing this[Music]so now that we attack these missiles I'mgonna give them a quick pat-down just tokind of see our progress see if we needto hit it up againshouldn't take one of our microfibertowels these things do have someinteresting grooves in them because ofthe pattern of that foam so you may haveto go at it a second time just becausethose grooves might trap some dirt inthere so as you can see the mid cellsdid clean up pretty nice but like I saidbecause of these grooves in the foam Iam gonna want to hit it again plus I gotto continue cleaning these outsole likeI said the foam is unique in it that hasthese grooves and that's something thatgives it its little characteristics butyeah let's finish up with these Altosand wrap up this cleaning throw theminto the laundry after that and then weshould be good to goso finishing up with these outsoles I'dbe lying if I said this wasn't a pain toclean because of all these grooves butwe do it for you guysso now that we got this also cleaned upwhat I like to do is lather up since weare throwing this in the laundry islather up this upper again hit it hit ithit it once over just because I like theshoe all suds dub when I throw it in thebag so I'm gonna do that really quickthen we're gonna throw these in thelaundry and finish up these cleaningit's not that my trusty cameraman Ronaldover there reminded me we've gotta cleanthese laces don't want to forget thatyou just want to dip them in your bowlof solution just like scrub off some ofthat excess rub your hands together withthem in there get these cleaned upreally quickly throw them in your bagand then let's head to the laundry sonow before we throw our shoes in thereyou want to make sure you secure the bagcool so you want to turn on your washerwe got this little trusty bad boy inhere in our restroom so turn it on grabsome of your Sneaker laundry detergentthis bottle seen better days but we'realmost towards the end of it so we'renot going to worry about that loosenyour cap squeeze in about an ounce youcan see it fills up there boom so youtake your solution or your detergentsorrypour it on your shoe there close thewasher up and since we are only doingone shoe you want to just make sure itis a small load normal cycle cold waterno hot water guys always use coal so wegot everything set up just hit up our Gobutton and let's get out of here let thewasher do its thing alright guys we'reback after putting the shoes into thewash as you can see they came out prettygood the only thing I will say is insome of these deep grooves on theoutsole sure you guys can get a look atthat I'm sure and get some good b-rolljust because of like I said when I wascleaning it all these grooves that areactually in this foam I knew it wasgoing to be a painso there is so a little bit of dirt inthese finer grooves right here butnothing really to worry about unless youwere like trying to resell them orsomething it's not that big of a dealbut everything else did get reallyas you can see the flying it turned outreally good so we're gonna lace these upwrap this up and let you guys get it onyour way alright guys so we went aheadand laced these up just like withunlacing them this thing was a pain tolace up it took a lot longer than itshould have we finally got it done so asyou guys can see that came out reallynice what we did on these today we useour three brush sneaker laundry kitclean the uppers with the soft brushwent back over it again with the mediumbristle brush or the all-purpose brush Ishould say tackle the outsoles and themid soles with that stiff bristle brushas you can see used it to get in thosegrooves one thing I did do that wedidn't show on camera because I reallywas trying to get that outsole reallyclean but was to use our brass bristlebrush this is really good for gettinginto some of those grooves you canactually really see it pretty good inthis translucent area of the midsole areof the outsole I should say if you lookon the Dirty Pair you can't even tellthat that part was translucent so it dida really good job with that we threwthem in our laundry with our laundry kitthe laundry bag our sneaker laundrydetergent went ahead and wrappedeverything up so that's gonna be it guysso all the good stuff make sure you guyssubscribe if you guys aren't alreadysubscribed we

hi and welcome to the running channeli'm andy and today together with annawe're going to be taking you throughsome of the very best trail runningshoes on the market right nowwe're not paid by the brands to say nicethings and all of the opinions thatyou're going to hear are our own so ihope you find them usefulnow i was recently asked by somebodywhether or not trail running shoesexist to help support pronationultimately the answer is no notspecifically but trail running shoes aredesigned to be more stable to help youdeal with uneven terrain and so on butrealistically the only way to find outwhether or not they're going to providethe degree of pronation support that youneedis to head to a store and try out thedifferent brands the differentcombinations of cushioning and archsupport that are going to work for youso stay tuned for our top picks as wewill both be choosingour favorite at the end of this videofirst off though if youare new around here please do hitsubscribe and tap the bell icon so youget notified when we upload new videosall about running which we do every weekthis is the nike pegasus trail 2 soas you can probably see well used imostly ran in these onesin the summer so when the trails were abit drierone thing that i did notice about thisshoe was actually where it was wet and abit slippy on rocksthe traction wasn't as great as some ofthe other trail shoes that i haverun in at 270 grams for a women'sfive and a half it's not the lightesttrail shoe out therebut it is comfy straight out of the boxso i feltabsolutely fine going out in a prettylong run to start with straightout of the box on this one it's reallycushionedthe nike react foam inside it makes it areal comfortable trail shoe when you'reout onrocks and on gnarly trails and thingslike that it doesn't havea rock plate but it didn't feel like itreally needed onethere were no issues with any rocks orany stones or tree roots coming inunderneath andbeing able to feel those with my feetthisparticular trail shoe is not waterproofhowever there is a gore-tex version likei say most of the trails that i've runin in these were in the summer monthswhere it was a bit drier sonot as wet as some of the trails outthere at the momentso overall a really comfortable shoe ireally do like this oneit feels very very comfy straight outthe box a really good fit true to sizei'm a uk six and a half and it feltreally comfythere was no issue with my slightlywider foot the toe boxtotally catered for that one thingthough is that aroundthe heel it does lack a bit of supportso if you are prone to going over onyour ankleand perhaps you like a bit of a snugfeel aroundyour ankle when you're looking for atrail shoethen perhaps this isn't the one for youbut overall i was really impressed withthe nikepegasus trail toothis is the colombian montreal fkt orfastest known timeand what i really liked about these isthey felt really comfortable straightout the box with a nice snug fitbut enough stretch in the upper toprovide a good fit for a different rangeoffoot shapes the upper itself is reallycomfortable but that's because it'sflexible andsoft and that does mean they're not themost well protected of the shoes on testand in factthey're quite quick to get wet and tosoak through and if you do run throughbranches then you'll probably know aboutitthey've got an eight millimeter dropcoupled with four millimeter lugs pertraction and i did find that they gavereally good grip in a whole differentvariety of conditionsthere's also a full length rock platewhich does do a good job of protectingthe underside of your feet against rocksor stones that you might run over theygive a really nice feeling of beingclose to the groundand feeling responsive for that butthey're definitely not the mostcushioned pair of trail shoes that i'verun inso you do need to weigh up yourpriorities of responsiveness versussofter cushioningso overall i really like the aestheticfit and grip and it's definitely worthmentioning that these are one of thecheapest pairs on test and that they'reavailable for substantially less thantheir rrpin a lot of places so they could be areally good introduction to trail shoesthis is the adidas 2 ultra pali sopretty standard looking adidasshoe made for the trails and it's madefrom theknitted ocean plastics so it's got abooty fit feel to it fitsreally really snugly around your anklecomes up quite highas well which is great for keepingleaves and rocks and dirtout of the inside of your shoe whenyou're running on the trailsso as with a lot of the adidas shoes italso has thecontinental rubber outsole thefit of this shoe did feel a little bitnarrow on my foot to start with so acouple of wears inand it does actually fit much better nowbut straight out of the boxi didn't personally find it ascomfortable as some of theother trail shoes but that is probablybecause of my wide footfor a uk six and a half lengthwise trueto sizebut i would recommend if you've got aslightly wider foot just trying it on ifyou canor giving it a couple of goes out thebox i know that a friend of mineduring lockdown ran 100 miles in thisshoe in one go non-stop well done fionaso i have it on good authority that itcan get you through some supertough mileage so it's prettystriking to look at too if you are atrail runneryou will know that the brighter thebetter and obviouslyit means that when it gets covered inmud you can still stand outso overall this shoe i did findcomfortable after a couple of wearsit's not the lightest shoe but it's alsonot the heaviest so it does feel reallyresponsivethere's no rock play and it's notwaterproof but there is a gore-texversion available of this shoe tooif you want to spend a little bit moremoney but overall on some of the muddiertrails especially that we've got duringthis winterthe traction is really good the lugsreally gripin nicely i've not fallen over in theseones yet which is a resultand so the adidas 2 ultra pali does geta thumbs up from methis is the salming trail hydro nowsalming are a swedish brand who alsomake handballand squash shoes so they might not be amainstream running brand that everyone'sfamiliar withthat doesn't mean that they're not worthconsidering trail hydro comes with quitea lot of features to keep you protectedout on the trailsfor starters they're waterproof using ahydroguard membraneto keep water out but also to allow yourfeet to breathe because of that theupper does feel a lot stiffer than youmight be used to from a road shoe forexamplebut they do have a nice comfortable softlining so i did find that they feltreally protective when i was out thererunning and i felt very well protectedfrom both the elements but also from anydebris-like branchesparticularly with the reinforcementaround the toe area there's a gussetedtongue which is also made of the samemembrane so it helps to keep the wateroutand there's a pull to tighten lacingmechanism a bit like those used onsalomon shoesand i found that gave a really nice fitand it was also as a massive bonusreally easy to use with cold wet fingersthere's also a vibram mega grip outsolewith four millimeter lugswhich i found a great grip even inpretty treacherous conditions there's afive millimeter dropin combination with a decent amount ofcushioning so in my opinion overallthese are a goodall-round shoe but not one for quickerrunning they don't feel particularlyresponsive but they do feel reallyprotectiveand might be a great option for longerdays out on the trailsthey're a little bit expensive from anrrp perspective so that's one thing tobear in mind so if these are somethingyou're interested in i'd recommendshopping aroundthis is the innovate g270not going to be missed in these brightones so these are actually the shoesthat i ranour scavenger hunt challenge acceptedtrailepisode in which was very very muddyand very very wet these shoes are notwaterproof my feet did get very verysoggy on that runhowever they are an incrediblycomfortabletrail shoe you've got some paddingaround the heelit feels like a more traditional runningshoe fitbut you've got the extra durabilityof it being the trail shoe innovateusing theirgraphene material one of the strongestmaterialsin the world in fact the issinternational space station usesgraphene the fat fansthere's no rock plate in this shoeeither but i didn't really feel like ineeded one the gripon it was fantastic going down hills inreally muddy conditions really slippysliding i didn'tend up falling over which is absolutelyunheard of for meso yeah really impressed with thatreally standardlacing system on it and really true tosize when it comes to the fitas well now trail shoes aren't renownedfor being the lightestrunning shoes in the world you've gotall the extra techand grips and lugs to keep you on yourfeetbut at 270 grams across the size curvefor this shoe it again isn't one of thelightest going it doesn't reallyfeel particularly cumbersome or heavy onyour feet and it's perfectly all rightfor chatting around on the trails whereyou're not going to be trying tobreak any world record times let's behonest but it's something to bear inmind that it isone of the heaviest shoes but reallyreally nice to run inthis is the ultra olympus 4. now ultrahave made their name for greatzero drop trail shoes and there areloads of brilliant things to like aboutthe olympus 4.but the first thing to notice is justhow different it looks the entire shoeis shaped completely differently to anyof the others that we're testingin this video that's even more obviouswhen you look at the bottom of the shoeand the fact that the toearea is shaped in this sort of slightlysquare wayideally to allow your toes to spread outbut still provide a good degree oflocked in feeling through the lacing andthe midfoot it's a really chunky andactually pretty heavy shoe but itdoesn't feel like that at all when youput it onit looks big but i found that the gustedtongue and the lacingprovided a really nice snug fit despitethat 33 millimeter stack height theydon't feel unstable thanks to the nicewide basei really feel like you could throwanything at these and have great grip aswelltrail shoes do quite often have a lowerdrop to provide greater stability andgreater feel for the trailsbut if you haven't ever run in a zerodrop shoe before then you shouldprobably think about being sensible andmaybe transitioning into the use of azero drop shoe over a period of timeoverall for me if you want a goodall-rounder you're comfortable with theidea of zero drop and you want a shoethat you can throw anything out andspendall day on the trails then this is agreat optionthis is a well loved muddy shoe it's thesalomon wild crossand i probably should have given it aclean beforepresenting this shoe to you and if youwant to know how to clean your muddyshoesmake sure you check out our video on therunning channel for that anyway back tothe salomon wild cross ias you can tell wear this shoe a lot onthe trailsat the moment um that it's so muddy andsoclaggy out there but this shoehas been one of my favorites i'mprobably going to give away the endingto this video quiteearly on so the salomon wild cross whatdo i love about it i love the lacingsystem on itwhen you go out and run on trails it'slikelythat you might get your laces caught upon a tree root or snagged on somebrambles and that kind of thingwith the salomon wild cross the lacingsystem isreally thin and really compact but ityou do it up by pulling thetag in the tongue and then tighteningthat downand then you tuck the extra loop thisbitinside a little pocket in the tongue soit is out of the way and it's not goingto snag on anything which is areally great feature of these shoes as isaidi've been out on the very muddy veryslippy trails in these shoes and thegripon them the system on the bottom on thesole of thesereally does grip incredibly well i'm yetto fall overon the trails in these shoes touch woodso salmon wild cross fitsuper comfy really cushioned and it isquite a heavy shoebut it doesn't feel heavy when it's onwhich doesn't really maketoo much sense but you've got so muchflexibility and movementthat it allows within the shoe itselfthat it doesn't feeltoo heavy on so thisshoe doesn't have a rock plate isn'twaterproofdefinitely had some very soggy feet onruns in these shoes buti really can't think of anything bad tosay about them theytruly are a great all-rounder forhitting the trailsstaying on your feet which is probablythe main thing andjust a real comfy shoe to be able to geta lotof happy miles inthis is the merrell rubato another zerodrop trail running shoe and the firstthing that i have to comment on is justhow plush and comfortableand soft the cushioning feels when youtry them on despite that level ofcushioning they're a pretty light shoeand even though there is a level ofprotection around the toe area herethe upper itself is also very lightwhich feels comfortablebut actually perhaps doesn't providesuch a great degree of protectionagainst the elements as some of theother shoes it's also worth notingthat i felt that the arch came up alittle bit higher so i felt that morewhen i was running so that's worthnoting depending on whether you do ordon't like that sensation of a moresupportive arch areawhen you're running they feel reallylight and bouncy to run inbut in comparison perhaps with the ultrafor example that high stack heightdoes make them feel a little bit lessstable and a little bit less responsivethey have a vibram mega grip outsole andi didn't experience any problems withthat whatsoeverso if you're looking for a shoe that'sgreat for all roundeasy running zero drop across alldifferent kinds of trail terrain thenthis could be a good all-round optionthis is the scarpa rush our heaviestshoe ontest and it certainly feels like a bitof abeast so at 300 grams for this shoeit's definitely not going to feelparticularly light when you're outrunning in it so the scarpa rushis what they call an ergonomic fit andit certainly provides anawful lot of support there's no rockplay and it's not a waterproof shoe butwhat it isis not a bad entry-level trail shoe soif you've never worn a trail shoe beforeand you're looking for somethingto get you started and you don't mindaboutwearing slightly heavier shoes then thescarpa rush is probably oneto consider for beginner trail runnersif you're just curious to find outwhat it's like running in trail shoes soit's gota really good grip system on the bottomso runningin muddy trails really good tractionon the wet and slippy mud andjust super cushioned overall so if youlike a cushioned supportive shoe whenyou runthen this is probably the trailalternative for youthis is the hoka one torrent ii and onthe insole it says lightweight andnimble and i'd have to agreeand i'd also add good value because thisis actually one of the shoes with thelowest rrpon test the fit is snug and there's areally good amount of cushioning on thegusseted tongue which i really likedthere's a five millimeter drop which ispretty standard across the hoka rangeand i feel that strikes a really goodbalance betweenresponsiveness and feel for the terrainand providing a good degree of supportone of the ways they've managed to keepthe weight down is to reduce the overallamountof outsole in fact if you look closelyat the bottom you can see patches of themidsole showing throughand aside from the lugs there are onlyselected areas where they've added thegrippy outsole materialthere isn't a rock plate so you do feela little bit more of the terrain asyou're running on itbut the profly midsole does a reallygood job of cushioning thatand where you lose that in grip you makeup for in responsiveness and theygenuinely do feel like a nimble shoeoverall this is a nice simple shoe thatdoes a great job all aroundand feels at home across a whole rangeof different paces out on the trailsthis is the fuji trebuco light by asicsreally lovelyand jazzy colourway on this shoe andthe name is a bit of a giveaway thelight means that it is actually ourlightest trail shoeon test so what's it like to wear on thetrails wellit feels like more of a typical roadshoe than a trail shoe you have got theadded tractionon the outsole compared to a road shoebut it is so light it's very speedywhat that means is that it's not thebest for really gnarly trails technicalstuff that's really slippy and muddybut if you're going out around yourlocal park or even on trails like theones behind methen this shoe is great for dailytraining reallyit's not waterproof there is a gore-texversion available and there is no rockplate either so that shows you the kindof terrainthat this shoe is suited to now ourprevious trail shoes round up we didactually feature the asics fuji tribucopro which i actually prefer to this onebecauseit had a different lacing system this isjust a standardlacing system compared to the previousoneand also the pro version has more ofa sock liner that goes around your anklewhich stops stuff getting into your shoewhile you're running so i did actuallyprefer the procompared to the lights but if you'relooking for a shoe that you can gofrom road to trail pretty easily andthat you can do a little bit of speedierstuff on the trails then thisis a good bat and actually it reminds mea lot of my first everpair of trail shoes which were asicsfuji attack fivesand it's a super comfy shoe it fitsreally nicely is a little on the narrowside compared tomost of the trail shoes that i've triedinthis test but it didn't cause me anyproblems fit wise it was true to sizeand more than anything just a a snug fitit's a really comfortable ride it's verycushioned especially around the heeland asics has their flight foam throughthe midsole tooto give you a lot more responsivenesswhen you arebounding down the trails so this is theasics fuji trabuco lightthis is the new balanced fresh foam moretrail v1 last time we looked at thehiero v5 which does have a gore-texupdate to it which might be worthchecking out if you're in the market forsomething like thatbut we wanted to focus on the more trailv1 in this testthis has a four millimeter drop which isquite a bit lower than the hiero v5 butone thing that they do have in common isthe fresh foam midsolenow this provides a substantial amountof cushioning and actually a really gooddegree of protection along with a smoothride with the fresh foam built up aroundthe heel area they did give a realfeeling of solidity out on the trailand the fresh foam midsole incombination with a slightly lessaggressiveoutsole than some of the others on testsmeant that they felt a little bit moreversatile and actuallywere comfortable running on the road aswell as the trails themselvesbecause of that though they are a littlebit less grippy although i didn't haveany problems on some of the trails thati normally run on they fit really snuglyand actually really like the lacingsystemand whilst there is a small amount oftoe protection i wouldn't say that theupper was particularly thick orprotective overalloverall i really like the design i likethe combination of colourslacing system and exaggerated midsole soif you're looking for something thatpotentially you could runto the trails in as well as tackle thetrails themselves then this is worth alookso now you've seen all the shoes it'stime for andy andi to pick our favorites andthis probably isn't going to come asmuch of a surprise to youif you've been watching the videoclosely that my favoriteis the salomon wild cross my wellused trail shoe why do i love this shoeit's incredibly comfortableit's incredibly responsive you feel likeyou've gottotal control over what your feet aredoing at the same time as havingplenty of support i just feel like i cango and runand run and run and run in these shoesthey're like i say so comfortable ithink the lacing system is really cleverand i absolutely love that you can justtuck them in and away you goso yeah for me it is the salomon wildcrossmaybe a bit cleaner next time and for meit's actually a pretty tough decisionbecausei felt like i would have chosendifferent shoes for different situationsbut if i had to pick one just the sheersimplicity and how fast they feltit would be the hoka ona own a torrenttoo

hi and welcome to the running channeli'm andy and today together with annawe're going to be taking you throughsome of the very best trail runningshoes on the market right nowwe're not paid by the brands to say nicethings and all of the opinions thatyou're going to hear are our own so ihope you find them usefulnow i was recently asked by somebodywhether or not trail running shoesexist to help support pronationultimately the answer is no notspecifically but trail running shoes aredesigned to be more stable to help youdeal with uneven terrain and so on butrealistically the only way to find outwhether or not they're going to providethe degree of pronation support that youneedis to head to a store and try out thedifferent brands the differentcombinations of cushioning and archsupport that are going to work for youso stay tuned for our top picks as wewill both be choosingour favorite at the end of this videofirst off though if youare new around here please do hitsubscribe and tap the bell icon so youget notified when we upload new videosall about running which we do every weekthis is the nike pegasus trail 2 soas you can probably see well used imostly ran in these onesin the summer so when the trails were abit drierone thing that i did notice about thisshoe was actually where it was wet and abit slippy on rocksthe traction wasn't as great as some ofthe other trail shoes that i haverun in at 270 grams for a women'sfive and a half it's not the lightesttrail shoe out therebut it is comfy straight out of the boxso i feltabsolutely fine going out in a prettylong run to start with straightout of the box on this one it's reallycushionedthe nike react foam inside it makes it areal comfortable trail shoe when you'reout onrocks and on gnarly trails and thingslike that it doesn't havea rock plate but it didn't feel like itreally needed onethere were no issues with any rocks orany stones or tree roots coming inunderneath andbeing able to feel those with my feetthisparticular trail shoe is not waterproofhowever there is a gore-tex version likei say most of the trails that i've runin in these were in the summer monthswhere it was a bit drier sonot as wet as some of the trails outthere at the momentso overall a really comfortable shoe ireally do like this oneit feels very very comfy straight outthe box a really good fit true to sizei'm a uk six and a half and it feltreally comfythere was no issue with my slightlywider foot the toe boxtotally catered for that one thingthough is that aroundthe heel it does lack a bit of supportso if you are prone to going over onyour ankleand perhaps you like a bit of a snugfeel aroundyour ankle when you're looking for atrail shoethen perhaps this isn't the one for youbut overall i was really impressed withthe nikepegasus trail toothis is the colombian montreal fkt orfastest known timeand what i really liked about these isthey felt really comfortable straightout the box with a nice snug fitbut enough stretch in the upper toprovide a good fit for a different rangeoffoot shapes the upper itself is reallycomfortable but that's because it'sflexible andsoft and that does mean they're not themost well protected of the shoes on testand in factthey're quite quick to get wet and tosoak through and if you do run throughbranches then you'll probably know aboutitthey've got an eight millimeter dropcoupled with four millimeter lugs pertraction and i did find that they gavereally good grip in a whole differentvariety of conditionsthere's also a full length rock platewhich does do a good job of protectingthe underside of your feet against rocksor stones that you might run over theygive a really nice feeling of beingclose to the groundand feeling responsive for that butthey're definitely not the mostcushioned pair of trail shoes that i'verun inso you do need to weigh up yourpriorities of responsiveness versussofter cushioningso overall i really like the aestheticfit and grip and it's definitely worthmentioning that these are one of thecheapest pairs on test and that they'reavailable for substantially less thantheir rrpin a lot of places so they could be areally good introduction to trail shoesthis is the adidas 2 ultra pali sopretty standard looking adidasshoe made for the trails and it's madefrom theknitted ocean plastics so it's got abooty fit feel to it fitsreally really snugly around your anklecomes up quite highas well which is great for keepingleaves and rocks and dirtout of the inside of your shoe whenyou're running on the trailsso as with a lot of the adidas shoes italso has thecontinental rubber outsole thefit of this shoe did feel a little bitnarrow on my foot to start with so acouple of wears inand it does actually fit much better nowbut straight out of the boxi didn't personally find it ascomfortable as some of theother trail shoes but that is probablybecause of my wide footfor a uk six and a half lengthwise trueto sizebut i would recommend if you've got aslightly wider foot just trying it on ifyou canor giving it a couple of goes out thebox i know that a friend of mineduring lockdown ran 100 miles in thisshoe in one go non-stop well done fionaso i have it on good authority that itcan get you through some supertough mileage so it's prettystriking to look at too if you are atrail runneryou will know that the brighter thebetter and obviouslyit means that when it gets covered inmud you can still stand outso overall this shoe i did findcomfortable after a couple of wearsit's not the lightest shoe but it's alsonot the heaviest so it does feel reallyresponsivethere's no rock play and it's notwaterproof but there is a gore-texversion available of this shoe tooif you want to spend a little bit moremoney but overall on some of the muddiertrails especially that we've got duringthis winterthe traction is really good the lugsreally gripin nicely i've not fallen over in theseones yet which is a resultand so the adidas 2 ultra pali does geta thumbs up from methis is the salming trail hydro nowsalming are a swedish brand who alsomake handballand squash shoes so they might not be amainstream running brand that everyone'sfamiliar withthat doesn't mean that they're not worthconsidering trail hydro comes with quitea lot of features to keep you protectedout on the trailsfor starters they're waterproof using ahydroguard membraneto keep water out but also to allow yourfeet to breathe because of that theupper does feel a lot stiffer than youmight be used to from a road shoe forexamplebut they do have a nice comfortable softlining so i did find that they feltreally protective when i was out thererunning and i felt very well protectedfrom both the elements but also from anydebris-like branchesparticularly with the reinforcementaround the toe area there's a gussetedtongue which is also made of the samemembrane so it helps to keep the wateroutand there's a pull to tighten lacingmechanism a bit like those used onsalomon shoesand i found that gave a really nice fitand it was also as a massive bonusreally easy to use with cold wet fingersthere's also a vibram mega grip outsolewith four millimeter lugswhich i found a great grip even inpretty treacherous conditions there's afive millimeter dropin combination with a decent amount ofcushioning so in my opinion overallthese are a goodall-round shoe but not one for quickerrunning they don't feel particularlyresponsive but they do feel reallyprotectiveand might be a great option for longerdays out on the trailsthey're a little bit expensive from anrrp perspective so that's one thing tobear in mind so if these are somethingyou're interested in i'd recommendshopping aroundthis is the innovate g270not going to be missed in these brightones so these are actually the shoesthat i ranour scavenger hunt challenge acceptedtrailepisode in which was very very muddyand very very wet these shoes are notwaterproof my feet did get very verysoggy on that runhowever they are an incrediblycomfortabletrail shoe you've got some paddingaround the heelit feels like a more traditional runningshoe fitbut you've got the extra durabilityof it being the trail shoe innovateusing theirgraphene material one of the strongestmaterialsin the world in fact the issinternational space station usesgraphene the fat fansthere's no rock plate in this shoeeither but i didn't really feel like ineeded one the gripon it was fantastic going down hills inreally muddy conditions really slippysliding i didn'tend up falling over which is absolutelyunheard of for meso yeah really impressed with thatreally standardlacing system on it and really true tosize when it comes to the fitas well now trail shoes aren't renownedfor being the lightestrunning shoes in the world you've gotall the extra techand grips and lugs to keep you on yourfeetbut at 270 grams across the size curvefor this shoe it again isn't one of thelightest going it doesn't reallyfeel particularly cumbersome or heavy onyour feet and it's perfectly all rightfor chatting around on the trails whereyou're not going to be trying tobreak any world record times let's behonest but it's something to bear inmind that it isone of the heaviest shoes but reallyreally nice to run inthis is the ultra olympus 4. now ultrahave made their name for greatzero drop trail shoes and there areloads of brilliant things to like aboutthe olympus 4.but the first thing to notice is justhow different it looks the entire shoeis shaped completely differently to anyof the others that we're testingin this video that's even more obviouswhen you look at the bottom of the shoeand the fact that the toearea is shaped in this sort of slightlysquare wayideally to allow your toes to spread outbut still provide a good degree oflocked in feeling through the lacing andthe midfoot it's a really chunky andactually pretty heavy shoe but itdoesn't feel like that at all when youput it onit looks big but i found that the gustedtongue and the lacingprovided a really nice snug fit despitethat 33 millimeter stack height theydon't feel unstable thanks to the nicewide basei really feel like you could throwanything at these and have great grip aswelltrail shoes do quite often have a lowerdrop to provide greater stability andgreater feel for the trailsbut if you haven't ever run in a zerodrop shoe before then you shouldprobably think about being sensible andmaybe transitioning into the use of azero drop shoe over a period of timeoverall for me if you want a goodall-rounder you're comfortable with theidea of zero drop and you want a shoethat you can throw anything out andspendall day on the trails then this is agreat optionthis is a well loved muddy shoe it's thesalomon wild crossand i probably should have given it aclean beforepresenting this shoe to you and if youwant to know how to clean your muddyshoesmake sure you check out our video on therunning channel for that anyway back tothe salomon wild cross ias you can tell wear this shoe a lot onthe trailsat the moment um that it's so muddy andsoclaggy out there but this shoehas been one of my favorites i'mprobably going to give away the endingto this video quiteearly on so the salomon wild cross whatdo i love about it i love the lacingsystem on itwhen you go out and run on trails it'slikelythat you might get your laces caught upon a tree root or snagged on somebrambles and that kind of thingwith the salomon wild cross the lacingsystem isreally thin and really compact but ityou do it up by pulling thetag in the tongue and then tighteningthat downand then you tuck the extra loop thisbitinside a little pocket in the tongue soit is out of the way and it's not goingto snag on anything which is areally great feature of these shoes as isaidi've been out on the very muddy veryslippy trails in these shoes and thegripon them the system on the bottom on thesole of thesereally does grip incredibly well i'm yetto fall overon the trails in these shoes touch woodso salmon wild cross fitsuper comfy really cushioned and it isquite a heavy shoebut it doesn't feel heavy when it's onwhich doesn't really maketoo much sense but you've got so muchflexibility and movementthat it allows within the shoe itselfthat it doesn't feeltoo heavy on so thisshoe doesn't have a rock plate isn'twaterproofdefinitely had some very soggy feet onruns in these shoes buti really can't think of anything bad tosay about them theytruly are a great all-rounder forhitting the trailsstaying on your feet which is probablythe main thing andjust a real comfy shoe to be able to geta lotof happy miles inthis is the merrell rubato another zerodrop trail running shoe and the firstthing that i have to comment on is justhow plush and comfortableand soft the cushioning feels when youtry them on despite that level ofcushioning they're a pretty light shoeand even though there is a level ofprotection around the toe area herethe upper itself is also very lightwhich feels comfortablebut actually perhaps doesn't providesuch a great degree of protectionagainst the elements as some of theother shoes it's also worth notingthat i felt that the arch came up alittle bit higher so i felt that morewhen i was running so that's worthnoting depending on whether you do ordon't like that sensation of a moresupportive arch areawhen you're running they feel reallylight and bouncy to run inbut in comparison perhaps with the ultrafor example that high stack heightdoes make them feel a little bit lessstable and a little bit less responsivethey have a vibram mega grip outsole andi didn't experience any problems withthat whatsoeverso if you're looking for a shoe that'sgreat for all roundeasy running zero drop across alldifferent kinds of trail terrain thenthis could be a good all-round optionthis is the scarpa rush our heaviestshoe ontest and it certainly feels like a bitof abeast so at 300 grams for this shoeit's definitely not going to feelparticularly light when you're outrunning in it so the scarpa rushis what they call an ergonomic fit andit certainly provides anawful lot of support there's no rockplay and it's not a waterproof

muddiertrails especially that we've got duringthis winterthe traction is really good the lugsreally gripin nicely i've not fallen over in theseones yet which is a resultand so the adidas 2 ultra pali does geta thumbs up from methis is the salming trail hydro nowsalming are a swedish brand who alsomake handballand squash shoes so they might not be amainstream running brand that everyone'sfamiliar withthat doesn't mean that they're not worthconsidering trail hydro comes with quitea lot of features to keep you protectedout on the trailsfor starters they're waterproof using ahydroguard membraneto keep water out but also to allow yourfeet to breathe because of that theupper does feel a lot stiffer than youmight be used to from a road shoe forexamplebut they do have a nice comfortable softlining so i did find that they feltreally protective when i was out thererunning and i felt very well protectedfrom both the elements but also from anydebris-like branchesparticularly with the reinforcementaround the toe area there's a gussetedtongue which is also made of the samemembrane so it helps to keep the wateroutand there's a pull to tighten lacingmechanism a bit like those used onsalomon shoesand i found that gave a really nice fitand it was also as a massive bonusreally easy to use with cold wet fingersthere's also a vibram mega grip outsolewith four millimeter lugswhich i found a great grip even inpretty treacherous conditions there's afive millimeter dropin combination with a decent amount ofcushioning so in my opinion overallthese are a goodall-round shoe but not one for quickerrunning they don't feel particularlyresponsive but they do feel reallyprotectiveand might be a great option for longerdays out on the trailsthey're a little bit expensive from anrrp perspective so that's one thing tobear in mind so if these are somethingyou're interested in i'd recommendshopping aroundthis is the innovate g270not going to be missed in these brightones so these are actually the shoesthat i ranour scavenger hunt challenge acceptedtrailepisode in which was very very muddyand very very wet these shoes are notwaterproof my feet did get very verysoggy on that runhowever they are an incrediblycomfortabletrail shoe you've got some paddingaround the heelit feels like a more traditional runningshoe fitbut you've got the extra durabilityof it being the trail shoe innovateusing theirgraphene material one of the strongestmaterialsin the world in fact the issinternational space station usesgraphene the fat fansthere's no rock plate in this shoeeither but i didn't really feel like ineeded one the gripon it was fantastic going down hills inreally muddy conditions really slippysliding i didn'tend up falling over which is absolutelyunheard of for meso yeah really impressed with thatreally standardlacing system on it and really true tosize when it comes to the fitas well now trail shoes aren't renownedfor being the lightestrunning shoes in the world you've gotall the extra techand grips and lugs to keep you on yourfeetbut at 270 grams across the size curvefor this shoe it again isn't one of thelightest going it doesn't reallyfeel particularly cumbersome or heavy onyour feet and it's perfectly all rightfor chatting around on the trails whereyou're not going to be trying tobreak any world record times let's behonest but it's something to bear inmind that it isone of the heaviest shoes but reallyreally nice to run inthis is the ultra olympus 4. now ultrahave made their name for greatzero drop trail shoes and there areloads of brilliant things to like aboutthe olympus 4.but the first thing to notice is justhow different it looks the entire shoeis shaped completely differently to anyof the others that we're testingin this video that's even more obviouswhen you look at the bottom of the shoeand the fact that the toearea is shaped in this sort of slightlysquare wayideally to allow your toes to spread outbut still provide a good degree oflocked in feeling through the lacing andthe midfoot it's a really chunky andactually pretty heavy shoe but itdoesn't feel like that at all when youput it onit looks big but i found that the gustedtongue and the lacingprovided a really nice snug fit despitethat 33 millimeter stack height theydon't feel unstable thanks to the nicewide basei really feel like you could throwanything at these and have great grip aswelltrail shoes do quite often have a lowerdrop to provide greater stability andgreater feel for the trailsbut if you haven't ever run in a zerodrop shoe before then you shouldprobably think about being sensible andmaybe transitioning into the use of azero drop shoe over a period of timeoverall for me if you want a goodall-rounder you're comfortable with theidea of zero drop and you want a shoethat you can throw anything out andspendall day on the trails then this is agreat optionthis is a well loved muddy shoe it's thesalomon wild crossand i probably should have given it aclean beforepresenting this shoe to you and if youwant to know how to clean your muddyshoesmake sure you check out our video on therunning channel for that anyway back tothe salomon wild cross ias you can tell wear this shoe a lot onthe trailsat the moment um that it's so muddy andsoclaggy out there but this shoehas been one of my favorites i'mprobably going to give away the endingto this video quiteearly on so the salomon wild cross whatdo i love about it i love the lacingsystem on itwhen you go out and run on trails it'slikelythat you might get your laces caught upon a tree root or snagged on somebrambles and that kind of thingwith the salomon wild cross the lacingsystem isreally thin and really compact but ityou do it up by pulling thetag in the tongue and then tighteningthat downand then you tuck the extra loop thisbitinside a little pocket in the tongue soit is out of the way and it's not goingto snag on anything which is areally great feature of these shoes as isaidi've been out on the very muddy veryslippy trails in these shoes and thegripon them the system on the bottom on thesole of thesereally does grip incredibly well i'm yetto fall overon the trails in these shoes touch woodso salmon wild cross fitsuper comfy really cushioned and it isquite a heavy shoebut it doesn't feel heavy when it's onwhich doesn't really maketoo much sense but you've got so muchflexibility and movementthat it allows within the shoe itselfthat it doesn't feeltoo heavy on so thisshoe doesn't have a rock plate isn'twaterproofdefinitely had some very soggy feet onruns in these shoes buti really can't think of anything bad tosay about them theytruly are a great all-rounder forhitting the trailsstaying on your feet which is probablythe main thing andjust a real comfy shoe to be able to geta lotof happy miles inthis is the merrell rubato another zerodrop trail running shoe and the firstthing that i have to comment on is justhow plush and comfortableand soft the cushioning feels when youtry them on despite that level ofcushioning they're a pretty light shoeand even though there is a level ofprotection around the toe area herethe upper itself is also very lightwhich feels comfortablebut actually perhaps doesn't providesuch a great degree of protectionagainst the elements as some of theother shoes it's also worth notingthat i felt that the arch came up alittle bit higher so i felt that morewhen i was running so that's worthnoting depending on whether you do ordon't like that sensation of a moresupportive arch areawhen you're running they feel reallylight and bouncy to run inbut in comparison perhaps with the ultrafor example that high stack heightdoes make them feel a little bit lessstable and a little bit less responsivethey have a vibram mega grip outsole andi didn't experience any problems withthat whatsoeverso if you're looking for a shoe that'sgreat for all roundeasy running zero drop across alldifferent kinds of trail terrain thenthis could be a good all-round optionthis is the scarpa rush our heaviestshoe ontest and it certainly feels like a bitof abeast so at 300 grams for this shoeit's definitely not going to feelparticularly light when you're outrunning in it so the scarpa rushis what they call an ergonomic fit andit certainly provides anawful lot of support there's no rockplay and it's not a waterproof shoe butwhat it isis not a bad entry-level trail shoe soif you've never worn a trail shoe beforeand you're looking for somethingto get you started and you don't mindaboutwearing slightly heavier shoes then thescarpa rush is probably oneto consider for beginner trail runnersif you're just curious to find outwhat it's like running in trail shoes soit's gota really good grip system on the bottomso runningin muddy trails really good tractionon the wet and slippy mud andjust super cushioned overall so if youlike a cushioned supportive shoe whenyou runthen this is probably the trailalternative for youthis is the hoka one torrent ii and onthe insole it says lightweight andnimble and i'd have to agreeand i'd also add good value because thisis actually one of the shoes with thelowest rrpon test the fit is snug and there's areally good amount of cushioning on thegusseted tongue which i really likedthere's a five millimeter drop which ispretty standard across the hoka rangeand i feel that strikes a really goodbalance betweenresponsiveness and feel for the terrainand providing a good degree of supportone of the ways they've managed to keepthe weight down is to reduce the overallamountof outsole in fact if you look closelyat the bottom you can see patches of themidsole showing throughand aside from the lugs there are onlyselected areas where they've added thegrippy outsole materialthere isn't a rock plate so you do feela little bit more of the terrain asyou're running on itbut the profly midsole does a reallygood job of cushioning thatand where you lose that in grip you makeup for in responsiveness and theygenuinely do feel like a nimble shoeoverall this is a nice simple shoe thatdoes a great job all aroundand feels at home across a whole rangeof different paces out on the trailsthis is the fuji trebuco light by asicsreally lovelyand jazzy colourway on this shoe andthe name is a bit of a giveaway thelight means that it is actually ourlightest trail shoeon test so what's it like to wear on thetrails wellit feels like more of a typical roadshoe than a trail shoe you have got theadded tractionon the outsole compared to a road shoebut it is so light it's very speedywhat that means is that it's not thebest for really gnarly trails technicalstuff that's really slippy and muddybut if you're going out around yourlocal park or even on trails like theones behind methen this shoe is great for dailytraining reallyit's not waterproof there is a gore-texversion available and there is no rockplate either so that shows you the kindof terrainthat this shoe is suited to now ourprevious trail shoes round up we didactually feature the asics fuji tribucopro which i actually prefer to this onebecauseit had a different lacing system this isjust a standardlacing system compared to the previousoneand also the pro version has more ofa sock liner that goes around your anklewhich stops stuff getting into your shoewhile you're running so i did actuallyprefer the procompared to the lights but if you'relooking for a shoe that you can gofrom road to trail pretty easily andthat you can do a little bit of speedierstuff on the trails then thisis a good bat and actually it reminds mea lot of my first everpair of trail shoes which were asicsfuji attack fivesand it's a super comfy shoe it fitsreally nicely is a little on the narrowside compared tomost of the trail shoes that i've triedinthis test but it didn't cause me anyproblems fit wise it was true to sizeand more than anything just a a snug fitit's a really comfortable ride it's verycushioned especially around the heeland asics has their flight foam throughthe midsole tooto give you a lot more responsivenesswhen you arebounding down the trails so this is theasics fuji trabuco lightthis is the new balanced fresh foam moretrail v1 last time we looked at thehiero v5 which does have a gore-texupdate to it which might be worthchecking out if you're in the market forsomething like thatbut we wanted to focus on the more trailv1 in this testthis has a four millimeter drop which isquite a bit lower than the hiero v5 butone thing that they do have in common isthe fresh foam midsolenow this provides a substantial amountof cushioning and actually a really gooddegree of protection along with a smoothride with the fresh foam built up aroundthe heel area they did give a realfeeling of solidity out on the trailand the fresh foam midsole incombination with a slightly lessaggressiveoutsole than some of the others on testsmeant that they felt a little bit moreversatile and actuallywere comfortable running on the road aswell as the trails themselvesbecause of that though they are a littlebit less grippy although i didn't haveany problems on some of the trails thati normally run on they fit really snuglyand actually really like the lacingsystemand whilst there is a small amount oftoe protection i wouldn't say that theupper was particularly thick orprotective overalloverall i really like the design i likethe combination of colourslacing system and exaggerated midsole soif you're looking for something thatpotentially you could runto the trails in as well as tackle thetrails themselves then this is worth alookso now you've seen all the shoes it'stime for andy andi to pick our favorites andthis probably isn't going to come asmuch of a surprise to youif you've been watching the videoclosely that my favoriteis the salomon wild cross my wellused trail shoe why do i love this shoeit's incredibly comfortableit's incredibly responsive you feel likeyou've gottotal control over what your feet aredoing at the same time as havingplenty of support i just feel like i cango and runand run and run and run in these shoesthey're like i say so comfortable ithink the lacing system is really cleverand i absolutely love that you can justtuck them in and away you goso yeah for me it is the salomon wildcrossmaybe a bit cleaner next time and for meit's actually a pretty tough decisionbecausei felt like i would have chosendifferent shoes for different situationsbut if i had to pick one just the sheersimplicity and how fast they feltit would be the hoka ona own a torrenttoo

LeBron 16 at 240 bucksso the LeBron did really well incushioning stiffness and it also didwell in energy return Jakari you werethe only one who picked the Bron foroverall performance yeah what do youthink now I think I made a good choicethat there in one of the top five okayis Jakari on to somethingthis is your market place basketball isback and all eyes are on Canada's teamthe Raptors for me is about comfort youwant to feel comfortable to give you alot of support especially for a big guymake sure it is high top and then Ithink that's that's the most importantissues be able to move and

swayingon this sneaker mixed with the nylon theleather swoosh don't don't we wastalking earlier offset too manyeah like I'd like how these are likethere's such a separation between all ofthe all of the different fabrics useyeah it all brings it all together likeyou know the pair that came out lastweek you know there was the black andthe white you know I think with most ofthose pair I think this looked a lot ofthis a lot of times it looks unnecessarybut with them using that that for colorwith adders print then you got this isexposed a cowhide like with the wingthis is a beautiful shoe I'm telling outright now it's in my handokay surprise like this is beautifulthis is like this shoe I love I lovethis Exodus a beautiful show I wasn't afan of the waffle I didn't like thoseother one this

grant picturewe're always good with those those arebetter than no good while you're whilingyou super Wilin okay no the shoe theshoe itself I feel the construction onthis one is much dope er yes 100% thecollar a sound the sakai is way betterthan this I have to agree with waybetter than this I had that bright colorthat rich yellow it's goodoh but this is a much calm and this is amuch softer colorway so you can do allthis thing about this shoe was thatcolor we would be signaling like Oh whatare you talking about we'd be like oh mygod this is crazyamazing well Sakai has absolutely what'sgood here nor thereno but I must say I must say I am a hugefan of Joanne's in general like thechill 197 Oh tail 197 beautiful and justlike as far as comfort the shoes isliterally a running shoe I believe itmight have been one of the first shoesto ever had the technology of the airpocket in that soul so like it literallyis a functional shoe but I'm a huge fanof the way it looks - I just I'm notcrazy about these colors together I'vealways said I cannot wear blue like blueis a weird well like darker blues is itI like it I like and maybe that'sbecause maybe that's because I'm I amusually attracted to those type of Bluesespecially with the contrast with thedarker blue on top of that like thisblue nylon for me it's just sold me nobut I mean don't get me wrong theconstruction of the shoe is fire I feellike anything any undercover and Nikecollab usually it turns out really goodlike reacts you have to see a bad collabwith them yeah so what do you think thiswould be well tell people what you thinkwhat well we tell people to box pricefirst Rito on these was 160 dollars nowas a seller what do you predict thatthese might get up to what's the crazyyou think gills I'm gonna predict Ilet's let's be clear okaythis the sneaker prices go up and godown alright let's say they sold outtoday online mm-hmm hypothetically mmlet's say for five hundred dollarsbecause the cigars that you had onearlier those are still going for like400 500 you know very very similarsneaker color wave wise though thismight not do that pricecuz like what's good you saythe red and yellow just pops so much onour other sneaker it gives it adifferent look to iti'ma stay that we have the Rings I'm astay that thing they'll get up to 50 to300 dollarswhat about you a good new yeah okay Ifeel maximum cap would be 307 yeah okayI mean I don't get a bad because if I'mnot able to get this pair for chancetoday I'm not giving out 300 so makesure y'all get a pair and if you don'tget a pin hit up chaos you're gonnacharge you $70,000 what you want getyour sneaker guarantee via Twitter freedelivery so we're a little under sidehere I wanted they don't who knows butwe want to know what you guys at homething so

collaboration let'slet's get a look at let's get a look atthis cuz I remember this being a veryslept on collab first first I would liketo say right bring this back bring theshoelace bags back man packaging come onwe're in the original boxes back womenround boxes but this came with a blueoriginally came with a blue shiny lilacmuch to replace the Python on a Nikecheck Nike swoosh part me crazy the fonton it back with spotchanges the game on it also filling hotI got the blue lace holes on it you knowI don't like the blueberry and I likethat is it the color you don't like howthey separated my bad you know that mustbe that must be a nice answer that yg noI don't I don't like it I don't like itI like I like when I like when Brantespecially collabs especially this was2010this one was sneaker collaboration wererelatively a new thing um you know thisis right after this look at this look atthis look at that attention to detailpeople this was right after the staplelike you know I mean like this is whenbrands were really realizing thatthere's there's a there's equity in thisthere's equity and collaborating with asneaker brand that's already establishedso they were I was lose a lot moreattention to detail even down to theblue lace hold you might not like it butI think it just goes to show howinvested the actual not only thecollaborator ones but as well as makingthe guys got that converse towbar and ifyou look at the Bible you look at stillsee you see there are that's kind ofMines we are going yeah no how do youknow yeah yeah bro yeah they remind me areckoned I think I think they're cool Idon't know it's okay this is probablywhat's throwing me offnow you guys already know not the mostfun person of black shoes doesn't matterand then I don't like blue and I justI don't know how you feel about the towbar I like it I like it I think it givesa a more upscale yeah yeah yeah makes itmakes it looks like it's a lot moreexpensive or a lot more high-fashionthese are super controversial thoughbecause people were saying that theywere biting off of Supremeshigh-speed it looks just like a bladesymbol oh I think I mean honestly thatthat Python Chuck kind of set it off andlike being that it was an SP blazer it'smore chunky so it looks closer turn offthey're like cousinsyeah and that brothers with theircousins honey mom sighs but they looklike brothers they're cousins what theylook like brothers but have you everused a result usery so have you everreach out so recited a purchase Anikanumber hold a book I want to be like ohand I do you pay for your sneakyabsolutely okay first of all yes I doknow my liquor so who's paying them forme all right so anywayI mean I mean I the closest I've goneobviously is stocks if I really can'tget what's good can I please cut you offno disrespect what's the differencebetween a oh the biggest we sell outhere right nowalthough they play the middleman rightbut stock X exists because of resellerstrue I guess that makes you know whatI'm saying like X does loan sneakers noyou don't always not these shoes wouldnot hold the value that they do if theseresellers weren't out here wallettaking everybody's pears I'm sorry stockX is a newer concept and resellers areperiod is it really stock it's nodifferent than a sneaker convention I'mnot saying it's a all that's all thering it's a it's a cause and effectthing I don't know I always say this Ithink stock X as we know controls themarket sometimes it hurts us asresellers sometimes it helps us becauseif stock S has a size 10 up there for$4,000 I'm a screenshot dad I'm gonnasing at the mouse and say yo bro youyour size is going for $1000 go stock XI got it for 600 get what I'm sayinglisten I think they are I think thatit's a necessary evilI think resellers within reason ifthere's somebody who is if this how youmaking a living up so that's saying thatthat's that would be like me getting madat somebody with a food truck thank youthey may not be able to afford arestaurant so they selling it out thefood truck the somebody like KS is a lotdifferent than some of these Instagrampeople we see is buying 50 thousand pairand then going to put a fifteen thousandpercent tax on the sneaker you get itI'm saying the difference between aresale letting them other guys you getI'm saying so I think it's a necessaryevil if it's sold out in the storewonderful to do just just take that outand I want to sneak it know I'm a hit upcase I'm gonna hit up go stock X reachout I'm not gonna hit up the person whocharged me three four times the pricelet's move

collaboration wererelatively a new thing um you know thisis right after this look at this look atthis look at that attention to detailpeople this was right after the staplelike you know I mean like this is whenbrands were really realizing thatthere's there's a there's equity in thisthere's equity and collaborating with asneaker brand that's already establishedso they were I was lose a lot moreattention to detail even down to theblue lace hold you might not like it butI think it just goes to show howinvested the actual not only thecollaborator ones but as well as makingthe guys got that converse towbar and ifyou look at the Bible you look at stillsee you see there are that's kind ofMines we are going yeah no how do youknow yeah yeah bro yeah they remind me areckoned I think I think they're cool Idon't know it's okay this is probablywhat's throwing me offnow you guys already know not the mostfun person of black shoes doesn't matterand then I don't like blue and I justI don't know how you feel about the towbar I like it I like it I think it givesa a more upscale yeah yeah yeah makes itmakes it looks like it's a lot moreexpensive or a lot more high-fashionthese are super controversial thoughbecause people were saying that theywere biting off of Supremeshigh-speed it looks just like a bladesymbol oh I think I mean honestly thatthat Python Chuck kind of set it off andlike being that it was an SP blazer it'smore chunky so it looks closer turn offthey're like cousinsyeah and that brothers with theircousins honey mom sighs but they looklike brothers they're cousins what theylook like brothers but have you everused a result usery so have you everreach out so recited a purchase Anikanumber hold a book I want to be like ohand I do you pay for your sneakyabsolutely okay first of all yes I doknow my liquor so who's paying them forme all right so anywayI mean I mean I the closest I've goneobviously is stocks if I really can'tget what's good can I please cut you offno disrespect what's the differencebetween a oh the biggest we sell outhere right nowalthough they play the middleman rightbut stock X exists because of resellerstrue I guess that makes you know whatI'm saying like X does loan sneakers noyou don't always not these shoes wouldnot hold the value that they do if theseresellers weren't out here wallettaking everybody's pears I'm sorry stockX is a newer concept and resellers areperiod is it really stock it's nodifferent than a sneaker convention I'mnot saying it's a all that's all thering it's a it's a cause and effectthing I don't know I always say this Ithink stock X as we know controls themarket sometimes it hurts us asresellers sometimes it helps us becauseif stock S has a size 10 up there for$4,000 I'm a screenshot dad I'm gonnasing at the mouse and say yo bro youyour size is going for $1000 go stock XI got it for 600 get what I'm sayinglisten I think they are I think thatit's a necessary evilI think resellers within reason ifthere's somebody who is if this how youmaking a living up so that's saying thatthat's that would be like me getting madat somebody with a food truck thank youthey may not be able to afford arestaurant so they selling it out thefood truck the somebody like KS is a lotdifferent than some of these Instagrampeople we see is buying 50 thousand pairand then going to put a fifteen thousandpercent tax on the sneaker you get itI'm saying the difference between aresale letting them other guys you getI'm saying so I think it's a necessaryevil if it's sold out in the storewonderful to do just just take that outand I want to sneak it know I'm a hit upcase I'm gonna hit up go stock X reachout I'm not gonna hit up the person whocharged me three four times the pricelet's move

every 28 seconds somebody buys aLiverpool kid that makes over a millionunits a year with a collapse recentsuccess demand has almost doubled sincelast season and the homekit is now themost popular in the UK supplying theLiverpool kid is a big deal and so itwas big news when the club recentlyannounced sportswear giant Nike as thenew kid supplier starting in June 2020in this video we want to look into thedetails of the dealhow Nike outmaneuvered New Balance andwhat LeBron James Serena Williams anddreg have to do with it especially sinceits acquisition by the Fenway SportsGroup and the arrival of manager JurgenKlopp the development of Liverpool hasbeen quite impressive both present andfuture looked bright with a 2019Champions League win as the recenthighlight this makes the club a valuableasset for brands and many sponsors seekto work together with a Liverpool tosell their products and be associatedwith the club's success so when theirkid sponsorship deal with New Balancewas up for negotiation it was nosurprise that many brands bid to becomethe new kid supplier New Balance wasdelivering the Liverpool merchandisingsince 2013 and saw a continuous growthof sales driven by two consecutiveChampions League finals the company waseager to extend the seven-yearrelationship and ready to pay 45 millionpounds per year besides New Balance theLiverpool executives talked to the threebig players Adidas Puma and Nikesince adidas had quit their sponsorshipagreement with Liverpool's seven yearsearlier calling the club overpriced theywere not considered a credible optionPuma had just signed Manchester City forreported 58 million euros and thereforedidn't have the budget for a competitiveoffer so the decision was to be madebetween the current sponsor New Balanceand the market leader Nike compared tothe 45 million pounds from New BalanceNike offered significantly lessguaranteed based compensation of 30million pounds but they also offeredmore marketing and sales efforts and topay 20% royalties of all net sales ofLiverpool merchandising the totalcompensation paid by Nike couldpotentially rise to approximately 70million pounds per year which explainsthe appeal of the Nike offer at thispoint it is essential to emphasize thatNew Balance had a vast advantage tocontinue its relationship with theLiverpool because of a clause in theircontract called matching right thematching right is standard in theindustry and enables the current sponsorto match any competitors offer andcontinue the contract with a respectiveclub so no matter what Nike offers NewBalance could always match the offer andbe sure that they keep Liverpool thatbeing said it seems almost impossiblefor Nike to sign Liverpool consideringthe value of the club and it's a recentChampions League title it was unlikelythat New Balance would not match anyoffer from Nikeand that is precisely what happens whenpresented the numbers from Nike the NewBalance executives immediately chose tomatch the offer Liverpool on the otherhand insisted on signing with Nike andargued that New Balance was not able tomatch all the terms of Nikes offer andso the case went to courton behalf of Liverpool acted council guymulpus who is well known in the sportsindustry for being the leading counselinvestigating the Lance Armstrong dopingaffair he argued that Nike offeredLiverpool to use three non footballglobal superstars of the caliber ofLeBron James Serena Williams and Drakefor marketing activities to promote theclub and that New Balance cannot matchthat in good faith because they do nothave global superstars of that caliberin their portfolio New Balance arguedthat the caliber of individual athleteswas too vague to be a materialmeasurable and matchable term NewBalances counsel had told the court onecould say you must spend a millionpounds on marketing and then it could bemeasured straight away but one has notgot that here but surprisingly the judgedisagreed he said in his statement thatLeBron James is the world's most famousbasketball player that Serena Williamshaving dominated women's tennis fortwenty years is one of the most famousathletes in the world and that Drake wasthe world's top-selling record an artistin 2016 in 2018 it would be unrealisticthat their caliber cannot be measuredthe judge ruled that the New Balanceoffer on marketing was less favorable toLiverpool than the Nike offeragainst all odds Nike won the case andwithered the sponsoring rights for oneof the most popular sport clubs in theworld not because of money or bonusesbut because of their iconic portfolio ofathletesin a way it is not surprising that thecourt found that certain types of starsattract a measurable valueit appears that brands will be forced toseek out super star endorsees to matchrights in sponsorship deals in thefuture although in this case there wasno cause for the court to say howinfluencer value should be measured wecan assume that clauses that do notspecify precise metrics will be open tochallenge in the future so the questionthat remains is how to measure thecaliber of an influencer social mediafollowers the maximum added value orexpected revenue growth for a companyare some vague ideas but it is notreally apparent until now and might alsodepend on the case one thing is for surethis judgment will no doubt boost theinfluencer stock the value of athletesand other brand ambassadors will furthergrow as an outstanding portfolio can noweven secure a unique advantage innegotiationsyou,28,UCggdHZVqgGXfuuS9kJ-OfeQ,Apogee Components,28,3,0,181,"['Nike Hercules rocket',

hey guysjanik here for cinecom.net and welcomeback to another copycatfriday and this week we are tackling thenew advert from knightor nike a week agonike released a you can't stop us advertand it tookevery social media by storm and ofcourse this is no surpriseas the ad is super good in meaning andexecution throughout the 90 secondadvert an athlete on one half of thescreenmirrors another one on the opposite sidemove for move as if they are one singlepersonthis represents the whole message behindthe advert we are never alone and that'sour strengthnow when seeing this i was honestlyblown away with the sinking and thematching ofall the clips nike i tipped my head toyouand that's why we had no other choice wehad to make this videoso enough yapping and let's startrecreating the first thing we now needis footage of athletesand a lot of it out of my research ifound out that nike had4 thousand hours of footage which theyreduced to 1 minute and 30 secondsnow a wild guess i don't think thatanybody here has4 thousand hours of sport footage justlaying aroundor do you that's why you have twooptionsgo out and shoot some sports yourself oruse stock lipsor maybe even mix things up and use themboth it doesn't really matter theprinciple stays the samenow we are going to start by using stockclips from our beloved sponsorstoryblocks videobut how do you start what's the rightfootagewell the first thing i did was look fora certain sportso on storyblocks video i startedlooking for running athletes and ofcourse i paid attention to a few thingsthe first is the resolution a higherresolution gives us more space to workwith in post-productionso i made use of the 4k search option ofstoryblocks videonow i started with running athletes butyou can really use whatever sport youwantwithin your search try to find two shotswith the same camera anglelike these two shots right here afrontal anglethat way we can match them easily andthis is why story blocks video isperfect for this effect they have a tonof sport stock clips you can usefrom basketball to football to balletyou will definitely findsomething you need on storyblocks videoand with only one single prize per yearyou can download as much as you want somaybeyou can have 4 thousand hours of sportfootage laying aroundwho knows for more information go to thefirst link in the descriptionbelow okay you find the footage you wantnowlet's kick off premiere pro here we cantake our two shots and place them in thetimelinenow if for example you didn't find two4k stock clipsbut only one then you best lay the 4kclip on topthis we are doing so that we can stillscale up or down without seeing theedges of the clipor losing quality then when in placeit's time to sync themso lower the opacity of the upper clipto around 50then let's look for a point to sink onthis can be something obvious like afoot hitting the ground or a certainmotionbut for us the foot will be the easiestso on the lower clip we looked for apoint where the foot is on the groundand trimmed the beginning of this clipto this point then do the same for theupper clip and we can already lay thembothin sync for the beginning anyways notevery runner has the same speedthat's why we also need to timer map theslowest runner because it's easier tospeed up your clip than to slow it downand make it choppybut before we can time remap we firstwant to get the positionand scale right so that the timer mapwill be easier now enable the animationfor bothposition and scale then adjust the upperclip to match the lower clipwe matched the face and the feet of thetwo runners and adjusted the positionand scale for the entire length of thetwo clipsmatching the top clip to the lower oneand with these adjustments you willalready sync up the tworunners next up is making the sink evenmore perfect withtime remapping so create a timeremapping keyframe on every foot hittingthe groundthen increase the speed a little bitbetween the keyframes to sync everyfootstep from both clipsand normally you now have two runnersrunning at the same speedthen it's time to create a split screenand we are doing this with a simple cropeffectjust select the top clip and right clickon it choose nest and on this nestedsequence we are going to add the cropeffectin the effects control panel set yourright crop to 50and boom we have a split screen andthat's the main principle for thiseffect butyou also have variations like you cansee right here where one athlete movesfrom one side to the other with acertain motionand from the split screen the secondathlete comes in with the same motionon the exact moment the first athletedisappears creating a smooth transitionbetween the twoathleteswhat a sentence but how can you do thatwellquite simple first look for stockfootage where the athletes have the samemotion like the rotation motion fromthis dancer and the snowboarder againplace them above each other in yourtimeline then look for the point wherethe dancer is nearing the middle of thescreen on this point the snowboarderalso needs to appearso with the position property place thesnowboarder in the right placethen enable the animations for theposition and go further in time untilthe dancer is completely goneon this moment the snowboarder needs tobe completely in the shot so animate theposition to do thisof course create your split screen likebefore and that's really it guysnow it's time for yannick fun factfountain first of all i like to mentionthat ever since i was a young boyi'm a huge fan of the nike advertsespecially the football themed onesthey were like short movies and a joy towatchback in the days but enough beingnostalgiclet's sum up some facts did you knowthat the founder of nikephil knight didn't really like the namenikehe opted for the name dimension 6 buteventually nike the greek goddess ofvictorymade the cut and another thing that philknight didn't like was the logohowever like you can guess they stillwent for the check marks wish logoand paid a hefty fee of 35 dollars foriti don't want to be that graphic designerand that was it for today guysthank you so much for watching thank youstoryblocks videofor the support and like alwaysstay creative so guys what do you thinkabout my black copycat t-shirtor is it black maybe it's blueor green orange purpleno it's black sorry i like the blackcopycat t-shirtit suits me better

hi so how do you tell the differencebetween an authentic 4-port opportunityor a fake one so today I'm going to showyou an authentic Barcelona 2015 2016Jersey that I bought online from areputable place versus a fake one that Ibought in laughs now one of the keydifferences obviously is going to beprice so that looks too good to be trueit probably isfor example this Jersey cost 150 USdollars online and the fake one was wasless than 10 US dollars at a store inLaos the other thing is going to be thefit of it so Mike actually makes twodifferent versions themselves it'salmost like they rip themselves off theymake what they call the the match orperformance or player shoe which isbasically the same Jersey that theplayers wear on the pitch and then theymake one that they call Stadium which isfor the fans it's cheaper it's alsobigger so this the match one is atighter fit for athletic bodies I preferthat being a fairly fit person the Ifind that the size small in theirstadium version is is too big in a bitbaggy whereas this is so small in the inthe match version as you can see it fitsquite snug and tightly you know I'll putthe Y over on to show you the differenceokay so this is the fake the knockoffversion of the of the Barcelona awayJersey obviously the one I was wearingwas their their home jersey and this isa knockoff of the authentic or or asMike calls it the match Jersey and asyou can see it's a lot more baggy that'snot quite as quite a fit it's probablyit probably is still a tighter tighterfit than the Mike official stadiumversion cuz I mean they're even biggerstill but I'm going to show you a fewmore detail differences as well okay sothe main differences between thesequality andpurely used and if you had a littletricks that I'll show you as welland it's also going to pen on the thequality of the paper this is a prettygood quality fake but it's actually Isuppose more similar to like stone ripoff the stadium version then the actualauthentic version on the 2015 version ofthe night soccer or football jerseysthey have these ventilation holes in theback seal is now on the real stadium orhome sorry the real match version youcan see that these five holes at theback of all got a lining to reinforceand strengthen them and the same withthe holes on the sleeve the other thingyou'll notice is that there's differentmaterial so if you hold hold this up tothe light you can see see through thismaterial here on the inside it's a bitof quite hollow weave for aeration andit's actually going to a differentmaterial at the top here at the back ofthe neck so it still has the holes butas you can see there's no noreinforcement around those holes on theinside there's the holes and also thethe fabric is pretty much the samefabric at the top here as it is downhere it's not you can't see through itas easily how does a lot of aerated onthe authentic match version you can seethey've got an extra layer of it's likea film here that goes over the seam soit's like a heat press seam it's notstitched this is on the inside of thecollar where is on on the knockoff youknow you've just got stitching thereas you can see the difference betweenthe the yellow knockoff here and theauthentic mic one here also if you lookat the stitching on the band down theside so the originals or the authenticmic one has got it doubled overstitching it's quite neat and tidywhereas the fete completely differentit's a much cheaper type of teaching nowthe other thing is the type of materialits use down this side on the fakeversion it's the same material all theway down all the way to the sleevewhereas on the the real like oneit starts with similar sort of materialbut then the holes get bigger as youmake your way to the sleeve then they'requite large holes there and again hereyou can see that material on the sleevesis slightly different to the material onthe shirt itself another thing is thestitching just around the whole outsideso this is the the bottom of the Jerseyso you can see it's got two two rows ofstitching their particular style but thefabric is just being cut and thestitching put across whereas on theauthentic one the to do it's only onerow of stitching but the fabrics beingfolded under and stitched along so itleaves a lot smoother and it's not gonnafray and that's along the bottom andalso the same thing around the sleevesit's being folded under there's on thesleeves of the fake again it's justbeing cut off so you can see that littleflap there another good point is thetags so on this tag you'll see this isthe authentic one the numbers on herethe style the color number andnow if you look at the tag on the insideof the jersey so it's got that same samenumber they're the six five eight sevennine zero and the four two two and it'sgot the s up there for small inside someof the ones I've seen do it's just gotthese larger tags yes another feature isthese authentic tags that night puts onhere so on the match versions then likeauthentic tags are gold on the stadiumversions they're actually silver now oneof the key differences you can see hereis that the fake ones actually stitchedon whereas the authentic ones actuallyheat pressed on the numbers are similarthis is sort of like a realistic numberso it looks like it could be real if thenumbers are too low then it could be afake as well the other thing I noticedwas that when I was in the store Ipicked up this Jersey I compared thisnumber on here against some otherjerseys that they had there there was aParis Milan Jersey and actually had theexact same number so that you know theforgers are going to make one of thesetags with the exact same number butprint heaps of them and put them on allthe tracks so if you if you're gettingonline you can't necessarily look at allwe have the jerseys there but if they'vegot photographs of the tags then youmight get a tell if they're all the samenumber across different clubs then thatobviously means they're fake now thematerial that's used in this fake is isprobably similar in feel to thematerials used in Mike's stadium versionso don't get confused between this andthe and the official mack stadiumversion because the night stadiumversion is the same material down theinside here as well rather than havingthe changes on on the match version okayso if we go to the logo itself noticethey both look very similar in this casethe I think the yellow here on the onthe fake is a bit off it's a bitbrighter than it is on the authenticMike one other thing is that it's it'squite soft and thin it's really easy tofold hasn't got a lot of stiffness to itwhereas the authentic ones got quite abit of stiffness and bulk to it otherthing is the the printing on the shirtso this is the Qatar Airways logono it's it's quite thin as well and itdoesn't have any little plastic coatingover it it's quite easy to fold whereasthe on the authentic one if you lookclosely it's got a little clear plasticcoating around the edge and it's quitestiff so that it's not folding as easilyit's quite thick and that's the same onthe sleeves so the logo on the sleevethe same sort of thing look at thatclosely you can see the the clear bitover the top is a quite smooth and yeahthe UNICEF logo on the backso it's the stiffer feel I'm comparisonto the the fake it's quite soft okay soanother thing to note is the quality ofour stitching inside the neck so insideyeah you can see that inside the neck atthe front this is the authentic versiondoes it's got the stitching around thetop here but the folded Euler piece offabric is actually glued or heat bondedtogether there you can see a little bitof some sort of plastic in material overthe edge there whereas on the fake youknow it's different stitching up herebut this is just folded over it's reallynot a poor quality in comparisonstitching the fake you know thestitching there is quite thick and solidbut there's not much of a gap betweenthe letters whereas the the authenticit's actually a finer stitched in thereit's thicker and it's got a bit of aspace between it so it's see the twoside-by-side you can see that theauthentic blue one there it's a bit of athinner stitching as far as the boldnessof the the letters themselves and a bitmore of a gap between the letters okayso another thing on the authentic one onthe sleeve here sorryfrom so then on the inside snow putthere well so you've got the dots acrosson the sleeve and on this one youactually got a hole this one thatactually got a whole panel stitched onhere whereas with the authentic one it'sthe same piece of fabric let's just gotthe darts in there on the peg on thesleeve it's a separate panel just inthere so yeah those are the maindifferences don't get confused betweenthe knife match and the knife stadiumbut this is a official knife matchplayer issue and this is a knockoff Mikematch issue so those are the sorts ofthings to look for when you're trying tospot

hi so how do you tell the differencebetween an authentic 4-port opportunityor a fake one so today I'm going to showyou an authentic Barcelona 2015 2016Jersey that I bought online from areputable place versus a fake one that Ibought in laughs now one of the keydifferences obviously is going to beprice so that looks too good to be trueit probably isfor example this Jersey cost 150 USdollars online and the fake one was wasless than 10 US dollars at a store inLaos the other thing is going to be thefit of it so Mike actually makes twodifferent versions themselves it'salmost like they rip themselves off theymake what they call the the match orperformance or player shoe which isbasically the same Jersey that theplayers wear on the pitch and then theymake one that they call Stadium which isfor the fans it's cheaper it's alsobigger so this the match one is atighter fit for athletic bodies I preferthat being a fairly fit person the Ifind that the size small in theirstadium version is is too big in a bitbaggy whereas this is so small in the inthe match version as you can see it fitsquite snug and tightly you know I'll putthe Y over on to show you the differenceokay so this is the fake the knockoffversion of the of the Barcelona awayJersey obviously the one I was wearingwas their their home jersey and this isa knockoff of the authentic or or asMike calls it the match Jersey and asyou can see it's a lot more baggy that'snot quite as quite a fit it's probablyit probably is still a tighter tighterfit than the Mike official stadiumversion cuz I mean they're even biggerstill but I'm going to show you a fewmore detail differences as well okay sothe main differences between thesequality andpurely used and if you had a littletricks that I'll show you as welland it's also going to pen on the thequality of the paper this is a prettygood quality fake but it's actually Isuppose more similar to like stone ripoff the stadium version then the actualauthentic version on the 2015 version ofthe night soccer or football jerseysthey have these ventilation holes in theback seal is now on the real stadium orhome sorry the real match version youcan see that these five holes at theback of all got a lining to reinforceand strengthen them and the same withthe holes on the sleeve the other thingyou'll notice is that there's differentmaterial so if you hold hold this up tothe light you can see see through thismaterial here on the inside it's a bitof quite hollow weave for aeration andit's actually going to a differentmaterial at the top here at the back ofthe neck so it still has the holes butas you can see there's no noreinforcement around those holes on theinside there's the holes and also thethe fabric is pretty much the samefabric at the top here as it is downhere it's not you can't see through itas easily how does a lot of aerated onthe authentic match version you can seethey've got an extra layer of it's likea film here that goes over the seam soit's like a heat press seam it's notstitched this is on the inside of thecollar where is on on the knockoff youknow you've just got stitching thereas you can see the difference betweenthe the yellow knockoff here and theauthentic mic one here also if you lookat the stitching on the band down theside so the originals or the authenticmic one has got it doubled overstitching it's quite neat and tidywhereas the fete completely differentit's a much cheaper type of teaching nowthe other thing is the type of materialits use down this side on the fakeversion it's the same material all theway down all the way to the sleevewhereas on the the real like oneit starts with similar sort of materialbut then the holes get bigger as youmake your way to the sleeve then they'requite large holes there and again hereyou can see that material on the sleevesis slightly different to the material onthe shirt itself another thing is thestitching just around the whole outsideso this is the the bottom of the Jerseyso you can see it's got two two rows ofstitching their particular style but thefabric is just being cut and thestitching put across whereas on theauthentic one the to do it's only onerow of stitching but the fabrics beingfolded under and stitched along so itleaves a lot smoother and it's not gonnafray and that's along the bottom andalso the same thing around the sleevesit's being folded under there's on thesleeves of the fake again it's justbeing cut off so you can see that littleflap there another good point is thetags so on this tag you'll see this isthe authentic one the numbers on herethe style the color number andnow if you look at the tag on the insideof the jersey so it's got that same samenumber they're the six five eight sevennine zero and the four two two and it'sgot the s up there for small inside someof the ones I've seen do it's just gotthese larger tags yes another feature isthese authentic tags that night puts onhere so on the match versions then likeauthentic tags are gold on the stadiumversions they're actually silver now oneof the key differences you can see hereis that the fake ones actually stitchedon whereas the authentic ones actuallyheat pressed on the numbers are similarthis is sort of like a realistic numberso it looks like it could be real if thenumbers are too low then it could be afake as well the other thing I noticedwas that when I was in the store Ipicked up this Jersey I compared thisnumber on here against some otherjerseys that they had there there was aParis Milan Jersey and actually had theexact same number so that you know theforgers are going to make one of thesetags with the exact same number butprint heaps of them and put them on allthe tracks so if you if you're gettingonline you can't necessarily look at allwe have the jerseys there but if they'vegot photographs of the tags then youmight get a tell if they're all the samenumber across different clubs then thatobviously means they're fake now thematerial that's used in this fake is isprobably similar in feel to thematerials used in Mike's stadium versionso don't get confused between this andthe and the official mack stadiumversion because the night stadiumversion is the same material down theinside here as well rather than havingthe changes on on the match version okayso if we go to the logo itself noticethey both look very similar in this casethe I think the yellow here on the onthe fake is a bit off it's a bitbrighter than it is on the authenticMike one other thing is that it's it'squite soft and thin it's really easy tofold hasn't got a lot of stiffness to itwhereas the authentic ones got quite abit of stiffness and bulk to it otherthing is the the printing on the shirtso this is the Qatar Airways logono it's it's quite thin as well and itdoesn't have any little plastic coatingover it it's quite easy to fold whereasthe on the authentic one if you lookclosely it's got a little clear plasticcoating around the edge and it's quitestiff so that it's not folding as easilyit's quite thick and that's the same onthe sleeves so the logo on the sleevethe same sort of thing look at thatclosely you can see the the clear bitover the top is a quite smooth and yeahthe UNICEF logo on the backso it's the stiffer feel I'm comparisonto the the fake it's quite soft okay soanother thing to note is the quality ofour stitching inside the neck so insideyeah you can see that inside the neck atthe front this is the authentic versiondoes it's got the stitching around thetop here but the folded Euler piece offabric is actually glued or heat bondedtogether there you can see a little bitof some sort of plastic in material overthe edge there whereas on the fake youknow it's different stitching up herebut this is just folded over it's reallynot a poor quality in comparisonstitching the fake you know thestitching there is quite thick and solidbut there's not much of a gap betweenthe letters whereas the the authenticit's actually a finer stitched in thereit's thicker and it's got a bit of aspace between it so it's see the twoside-by-side you can see that theauthentic blue one there it's a bit of athinner stitching as far as the boldnessof the the letters themselves and a bitmore of a gap between the letters okayso another thing on the authentic one onthe sleeve here sorryfrom so then on the inside snow putthere well so you've got the dots acrosson the sleeve and on this one youactually got a hole this one thatactually got a whole panel stitched onhere whereas with the authentic one it'sthe same piece of fabric let's just gotthe darts in there on the peg on thesleeve it's a separate panel just inthere so yeah those are the maindifferences don't get confused

black red which retailed at twohundred and twenty dollars in 2016 andnow resales for nine hundred thefragments resale value more than doublesits competition these shoes were bothsold in limited releases so why didJordans become so much more expensive it[Music]all has to do with the value of theJordan Brand and how it makes andmarkets its iconic sneakers in fact thatit's made in China where the tariffs arehigher are made in the best factoriesmade with more material basketball shoestend to use more material than a runningshoe and then trying to be as close tothe original product for all things thathave driven prices up there according toMatt's research the average price of abasketball sneaker is about 110 dollarswhile Jordans average price is about 145to understand why Jordan Brand cancharge more let's go all the way back tothe beginning before the Jordan one wasintroduced before the 1984 to 85 seasonNike signed an unproven MJ to afive-year deal worth more than threetimes the riches contract to that pointbut that wasn't the only unusualdecision Nike made while launching theAir Jordan brand the Air Jordan oneswapped the standard white upper for ablack one which violated the NBA'suniform policy and resulted in a $5,000fine per game on September 15 Nikecreated a revolutionary new basketballshoe on October 18th the NBA threw themout of the game Nike recognized thisunique marketing opportunity and footedMike's bill as he went on to win Rookieof the Year playing every game in hisband namesake sneaker they just showedthat he was rebellious and it wassomething that people gravitated to himthey wanted to wear them too it was likethe first sneaker that really shook upsneaker culture I think it's the shoethat catapulted sneakers to where theyare today because it was the first shoethat people saw and wanted more thanthatsure Mike success as a rookie made a bigimpact on Nikes bottom love the originalJordan one hit stores across America inMarch 1985 priced at $65 and at

do you know do you know that'sright Air Jordan Air Jordan Air Jordanyou really saw the Jordan Brand become aluxury brand in the United States it wasour designer sneaker and it made theshoes very visible and that's a big partof the conspicuous consumption is to beable to look across the room and seethat that person is wearing $100 shootone or $300 shoe in today's parlanceduring all this the price of Jordans hadjumped to $100 significantly higher thanthe top basketball sneaker at the timeconverses weapon jordan market is itsneakers as a luxury product to matchMJ's talent and style and in the processcreates the cultural phenomenon bringingsports apparel into the mainstream hewas a very marketable figure with agreat smile and a big hoop earring andpeople wanted to look like him and soyou started seeing this face all overthe world but the brand priced out kidsfrom low-income families who wanted themthe most and by the 90s Jordans was socoveted violence erupted around them toteens

ledbythree haas mba students each of whomwillintroduce themselves on behalf of all ofus here at berkeley haaswelcome back mattso i want to start us off with aquestion aboutyour time at berkeley i know you were astudent athlete i understand you were apitcherand you were also a haas undergrad soas you reflect back you share aparticular memoryor a highlight from your undergraduateyearwell sure and thank youthank you dean for for having me herei'm super delighted toto have the opportunity to speak to thestudents today in the communityyou know as i think back on my time atcal i think of it pretty fondly becausei feel like it was where i grew upi you know moved away from home i hadthe opportunity to make new friendshipsand many friendships which have stayedwith me forthe more than 20 years since i'vegraduated andi think probably some of the things thatwere most notable to me outside ofplaying sport wasgrabbing my daily cal every day and andand reading it and trying to solve thepothe crossword puzzle and um and uhthe great group related experiences thati got at haasso i enjoyed the classes that i took theteachers that i met and got to knowbut it was really the group activitiesand learning how to work in groups thatreally had apretty profound impact on me andprepared me forum for my future career and i'd neverexperienced anything like thathey matt uh it's so great to be chattingwith you it's really such an honormy name is adithya and i'm aco-president of the haas finance clubas a future investment banker and alifelong nike fanatici'm really excited to be asking you thisquestion sohow would you say your experience as aninvestment bankerprepared you to serve as a cfo of amulti-billion dollar global brandwell i would start by saying that what iwas most focused on when i graduatedfrom haaswas my firstmy first experience working in order tobuild the foundation a solid foundationfor a long-term career in business andafter talking to a number of people iultimately decided thatthat investment banking was the bestpath to go because i figured that itwould help blend accountingcapital markets and valuationum and i probably didn't fullyappreciate how much strategicuh insight and learning i would have asa result ofof working with corporations thinkingabout their businesswhen i translate those experiences towhat probably has helped me the most atnikeis the mindset of being a value creatorum always trying to figure out how tocreate valueum in every business decision that youtakeand the beauty of that type ofperspective if you go back to maybe acouple of things that that our dean saidhere at the startyou sometimes have to make decisionswhen you're in leadership of companythat don't translate into value in thefirst quarter second quarter or even thefirst year that you do itbut if you've got a mindset that has avision forfor what uh what you're trying toaccomplish over multiple yearsum you'll make those decisions becausethey're the right decisions to makefor the long term and i think that thatrooted mindsetin in value and valuation andhow running a business can impact andcreate value for your communities andfor your shareholdersultimately became a an incredible sourceof strategic value for me and runningnikehi matt thank you so much for taking thetime to speak with us todayi'm wyatt davis a second year full-timemba at haasand i will be joining nike this summeras a digital product manager in theconnected marketplace teamso before we jump in could we do a quickkick checkwhat do you got x95 awesomeall right so for my first question uh inaddition to navigating the covidpandemic and the surge in the blmmovement nike has been undergoing amassive organizational transformationfor the past yearwhat personal characteristics andqualities most helped you lead throughthis timeand can you share a mistake or learningmoment you hadsure well i i'll start by saying that iwas named cfoum in february of 2020 and sothe um my experience ofof what i envisioned for my career andstarting my career as cfowasn't ultimately what came to life interms of a global pandemicoccurring about a month and a halfafterwards but it's been a credibleexperiencefrom a learning point of view and umwhat i would say is is thatyou know my first goal and objectivethrough all of thiswas to remain calm and measuredwe have 75 000 employees around theworld we were dealing with the pandemicaffecting our business in different waysin different countries at differenttimesand what our employees needed to see wasa sense ofconfidence and a sense of calmness as wewere assessing everything that was goingonand really trying to set clear directionfor the businessso one of the things that we did at thestart was we wereorganized the company around thisconcept ofof what were the operating and financialmeasuresthat were most important for us to drivesuccess over a six to 12 month periodthose looked very very different than atypical budgeting process or strategyprocess strategic planning processand it created an immense amount offocusand clarity for our teams in terms ofdecision making and uhand driving alignment another thing iwould say is resilienceif all of us haven't learned howimportant it is to be resilientover this past year i would say thatit's incrediblyimportant the circumstances that we'redealing with every day are unpredictableandwe've watched multiple umcircumstances from the pandemic to theissues around racial injustice toum you know to to you know global uh orgeopoliticalyou know challenges and complexities umtoto to the things that we're dealing withhere in our domestic marketsthe reality is is that every day feelslike there'snew things that are on the horizon andumand any plan that you had you had to beprepared toto reassess through a filter of of whatmatters mostto your business and to make thosedecisionsi would say from a human perspective theimportance as a leader of listening toyour teamsum i'll come back and hit my my learninguh ormy mistake that i made but umreally really important to be listeningto your teams and the input of yourteams on the groundand um that really connects prettyclosely to empathyyou know being an empathetic leader evenwhen you don't have all the answerscreating space to be able to have yourteamshare with you um what concerns theyhave what fears they have what isissues they're they're struggling within the midst of being remoteand lacking human interaction and umand how creating that space uh gavepeopleuh confidence in in me as a leaderand um in leadership to get through itand most of those things frank they sumup as humility because we didn't haveall the answerswe didn't know what next week was goingto bring um but our focus and attentionwas ontrying to steer the company in a in adirection thatwas right for people prioritizing safetyand healthfirst and um and tryingtrying to make the right decisionsbecause we knew that for the long termthat nike would be would be okay and umand we had to we had to really focus onthose issues that mattered moston your question about a mistake youknowi i have a tendency to have a high biasfor actionand i think thati think that at the beginning of thepandemicwe were trying to process quickly whatwas happeningand quickly start to direct the teams onthe actions we thought they needed totake in order to try to address theissuesand and the circumstances and what westarted to realize was things wereflying at us faster than we coulddirect out and we were slowing the teamsdown and we weren't empowering them toto be aware of and be on the lookout forwhat was happeningand then to make decisions that theyneeded to make at the local level inorder to be able to winand um and to support the teams and tocare for peopleand um and so pretty quicklyin the in the pandemic we ultimatelydecided that we hadwe had to provide very clear tops downdirection on what thewhat the items were that mattered mostbut really try to provide a lot ofum a lot of space for local leaders tobe able to lead their teamsand to make decisions on the ground thatwould latter up tothose bigger those bigger imperativesfor the companythank you uh for the next questiondespite its size nike operates as ahigh-growth innovativebold and agile company how do youinstill these qualities into the companyculture and your teams on a daily basiswell i think it's a great question ithink it's it's especially important forfor students who are you know who arecontemplating theirlong-term career um you know there's twothings that i personally look forwhen i'm interviewing people to work onmy leadership team and to work within myorganizationone is is it's imperative to have agrowth mindsetand um and that means that you'relearning and want to learnevery day and um i've experiencedworking with people at different pointsthroughout my career where they tend tohavemore of a perspective of i know it and iknow what we need to dorather than a mindset that says i'mconstantly processing andlearning from the people who work aroundme from reading things fromyou know doing checkpoints with otherindustrieshaving broader network and connectionswith your peersjust has a huge impact on the way thatyou canprocess information and then apply it toyour current job andso i'm constantly looking for peoplethat have uh a growth mindset andsecondly people whowho demonstrate a learning agilitybecause you know thethe world is changing rapidly and youknow at nike we've experienced this inthe context of watching the wayconsumer connections with brands to theway that digital has interplayed intoour supply chain to the way it'stransforming retailour business is changing and yet westill pride ourselvesoff of innovation and the products wecreateand and the way that we connectstorytellingwith amazing products for consumers butthe way we operate is a company'sfundamentally changing end to end acrossthe value chainand so if you so you got to have peopleon your teams who demonstrate thisagility toto to to be excited and energized by newways of working and andexploring and challenging the status quoin order to try to take the company to adifferent leveland um it's been really fun for me overthe past 12 years at nike to be on thatjourneyand um and uh i've just i'veyou know it's been fun to be a part ofit and you know we're not done we've gota lot in front of us to do in order toum to continue to to have the kind ofimpact that we think we can have forconsumersum for our communities and ultimatelyyou know that should translate intoshareholder value as wellthank you hey matt my name is tessit's great to virtually meet you i'm afull-time mba student at berkeley haasand the co-president of net impact hereon campusi wanted to ask you a few questionsabout nike's environmental and socialimpactso recently nike announced that it willsell slightly worn footwear and selectstorescould you tell us more about why nikemade that choice and how you anticipatethis will impactnike's operations sustainability goalsand financialsalso are there any other circularsolutions that nike is exploringsure well you know we've we've been onthe front end ofsocial impact and the impact that ourbusiness has on the environment fora long time actually you guys may havemet chuck gatchell at some point in timechuckis uh actually a close friend of mine wemet in the dorms our freshman year atcaland he was a runner and i was a baseballplayer andhe actually ended up at nike before idid working throughour sustainability and impact group soum he was at my wedding i went to hiswedding like we go back a longway and so um there's a close friendshiptherebut um uh you know for us it's alwaysit's been a huge impactin the way that we think about ourbusiness and the responsibility that wehave to the worldwe know that the products we create uhhave an impact on the environment and aswe've gotten to the scale that we haveas a companyum it's sort of thatthat standard you know perspective whichis if you're selling 500 million pairs ayearand you're going to sell 750 millionpairs within the next strategic planningcycle or a billion pairswhat impact is that going to have from acarbon footprint towaste to renewable materials toum you know to the impact on water andbeyondlet alone the employee side of it interms of theeconomies that we're impacting in termsof where we where we create our productand and how we ensure that those thoseemployees and those workers are beingtreated fairly in the environments wherethey're workingin order to create great products thatwe enjoy umthe specific question about therefurbishing is kind of a fun one i'llbe honest becauseas we continue to test and learn at nikeone of the things that we've realized isthat we have to stamp outnike bias when we pursue new businessopportunitiesso this initiative in particularwas something that was tested unbrandedwe had a hypothesis that saidwe have we create a significant amountof waste in our supply chainbut also in when products have me havemet the end of their life cyclebut there's also a lot of product thateither gets returnedbecause because it maybe is defectiveand that gets destroyedbut there's some product that getsreturned that never ends up seeingany usage whatsoever and so we tested abusiness concept which wasis there a price point and a value forconsumers at a lower level where reusedproduct would be a value ratherthan it being destroyed and ending up inlandfill orin some other place that would beterrible for the environmentextending the life cycle of the productand getting full usage out of itwe're also investing and so we're justtesting that i should say in ourin our our factory stores today in northamericaand we're on the front end of seeingwhat the consumer reaction to that isbut it's definitely something thatwe believe is good for the planet andgood forgood for our consumer relationshipswe've also been investing in recyclablematerials i remember back at the worldcup in 2012and then again in sorry in 2010 and thenin2014 where we were making jerseys teenjerseys out of recycledplastic all of a sudden that became notinteresting totalk about anymore even though we hadinnovated that at the beginningso then you translate to flyknit whichwas in our in our footwearthat was created out of recycledplastics i remember going to factoriesin china and watching the way we werecleaning plastic bottles and thenshredding them down and turning theminto yarn and then basically creating amaterialthat was far more sustainable andreusablebut what i'm really excited about todayare some of the products that we've putto market likethe space hippie or cosmic unity andbasketball where we're starting to lookat complete closed-loop creation ofproductwhere they're marching towards the thegoal of being a hundred percentbut still maintaining performanceattributesso that we're creating products that arebetter for the planetbut also will meet a purpose of servinga value for an athleterunning a marathon uh being able tocompete on an nba courtum or otherwise and so for us you knowit'sthese goals and these objectives arepart and parcel with who we are as acompanyand um and something that we're veryproud of in terms ofuh what we've been able to accomplishand and we see so much opportunityahead hopefully you've read our 2025impact report butum clearly setting goals for where weintend to go as a companyum and uh the great opportunities thatwe see in front of usthank youhey it's me again so john donahoe theformer ceoceo of ebay took the role of nike ceolast yearto elevate the company's technologicalaspirationsyou briefly touched on this earlier butwould you now describe nike as amarketing company that's focused onstorytelling and product developmentor would you consider the company as atechnology brandand as a follow-up how are you as thecompany's cfosupporting the uh this transitionwell so yes john was the former ceo ofof ebay he's the chairman of the boardof paypalum he's he was the ceo of servicenowif you've heard of that company um andhe'd been on nike's board for about fiveyearsbut the transition that we've beenmaking um actually has been enabled bytechnologyand so we communicated a strategy as acompany about four years agothat we called the consumer direct uhthe consumer direct strategyand basically what we realized was thattechnology was enabling niketo um create direct connections withconsumers in ways that we werepreviously unable to doworking through retail partners whocould disintermediate usand through large media networks andpeople who owned media channelswho also dis intermediated us fromconsumersin terms of being able to communicatedirectly with themand uh and to make it a two-waycommunicationwhen the pandemic hit we realized thatshopping behaviors were changingfundamentallyand so we saw an opportunity for us toeven shift and reallocate resources moreintentionallyto be able to accelerate this digitalstrategybecause we our hypothesis was that umsome of the largest retailers in thecountrylike well i don't need to mention namesbut you know who they are the largestretailerwe're only going to become more powerfuland did we want to just tradethe relationships that we had withsmaller retailersum for uh working with larger retailpartners or did we want to invest ourresources to try to create those directconnections with consumersat a greater scale and that's what wechose because we felt like that wasgoing to create greater long-term valueand we also believed that as a brandthat we were one[Music]of the few companies that had theability to take a business that was over40 billion in revenue built under oneset ofhypotheses and beliefs to say that wecould shift resources and focuscompany attention and actually be ableto transitionand capture more value in therelationship with consumersand change the profile of our businessso that's what we've been underunder foot for a while um literallyunderfoot but that's what we've beenunderundertaking for several years and umi think i mentioned you know in a priorpart of the conversationproduct innovation and product andstorytellingis what makes nike special we could havethe bestmobile app we could have the bestdigital commerce relationshipbut if we didn't have great productsthat consumers wanted it wouldn't matterright and so because we're not justbuilding a platform to sellmultiple products we're building atighter and more intentionalrelationship with conconsumers and so what we've done throughthe pandemic and even beyond what i'vebeen focused on in my roleis ensuring that we're investingmaniacally behindproduct innovation sustainabilityand then ultimately creating thesedigital a digital platformthat enables us to have those one-to-oneconnections withconsumers at scale personalizationleveraging data analyticsmachine learning so that we can readpatterns and consumer behaviorwe're employing data and analoganalytics capabilitiesin our supply chain so we know how tomore smartly flow ourproduct where to put our productum the net benefit of that is highermargins because we have less wasteless markdowns less inefficiency andwhere productsits around the world um it also enablesus to ensure that we're more closelycorrelatingour carbon footprint with the movementof goods and services so that weactually are getting value out of itversus you know when i joined nikeyou'd have somebody in marketing wouldsay hey i gotta have a million units onhand at this location by this dateso you put on an airplane but then youturned out that you realize that youonly sold 20of those products in the first two weeksbut you spent the money putting it on anairplane and had the negative carbonimpactwhen you could have put it in adifferent mode to get the product tomarket and you could have had a betterenvironmental impact and better marginsand so it's that type of work andthinking that we're trying to drive atthe company in order to try to optimizeum you know optimize all of thesedifferent elements of our focus andattentionwe are clearly really going to be atechnology companybut it's not in place of product andstorytelling and innovation and productbut we believe that for us to berelevantin a world where we're seeing more andmore consolidation ofplatforms you know consumers arespending the majority of their timeshopping in five or six locationsthey're using10 apps or less to engage on a dailybasisyou know with their friends and familythe reality is is thatwe have to leverage our scale but thebig opportunity for nike is how weresponsibly leverage the data thatconsumers give to usso that we can and so that we can servethem in more personalized waysand create reasons for them to want toengage with our brandmore consistently as opposed to it beingyou know a less informed less bespoketype of business which is which isyou know the way that nike was wasoriginally createdand um and succeeded so a lot of changeof foot at the company but technology isanand for us and we see it as a hugeopportunitygreat thanks matt i actually want to diga little deeper into the nike directstrategyand so nike's been investing heavily inthis channel and it is alsowidely recognized now as the leader indtc during the coven 19 pandemicso you talked about how nike is going tocontinue growing this strategyin the post-pandemic world but what doesthis mean for the company's flagshipbrick and mortar stores wellwhat it means is we're going to havemore of them so we've built our businessprimarily throughwholesale partners you know the bigretailers that you think of foot lockersmacy'sum you know if you remember dick'ssporting goods you knowwe have all of these partners andseveral of them will continue to beimportant strategic partners for usbut one of the things that wecommunicated a couple of quarters agois that we need a larger store footprintwe need a larger a larger storefootprint so that we can becloser in proximity to our consumersaround the uswe believe that that's going to enableus to create betteronline to offline connection pointsthat are very difficult for us to dobetween our own digital platform andwholesalephysical retail platform and so you'regoing to see us openyou know 150 to 200 stores in the unitedstatesand that number continues that's whatwe've communicated publiclybut we continue to reassess andre-evaluate that number as we seeconsumer interest and desire to be moreclosely connected to nike these aren'tgoing to be like the nike towns that youexperience if you visited you know fifthavenue or you've been in new yorkor in london or or in other places likethatwe're talking about smaller footprintstores that are more digitally enabledso a smaller footprintsmaller back of house more leveragingdigital capabilities and a single sourceof inventory supplyso that we can um so that we can servedemand that consumers havebut also create places where people cancome and engage with the brandum where they can participate inactivitieswhich has been very successful for usand then ultimatelyum you know take care of their theirconsumer eliminating consumer frictionsthat exist when people buynike product so you're going to see morestores from nikeand you're going to see them you'regoing to see thempositioned in the marketplace in a waythatthat that reprofiles the way thatconsumers are engaging with brandsand with that we're excited because itenables us to control our storytellingbut also to create a more consistentexperience for consumersso that when they're buying our productsthey know that they're authenticthey have that connection point um andthey're recognized as aas a and the consumers are recognized asmembers of our brand anduh and our companythank you matt um i'm just popping backin sonike is known for its work in socialjustice can you tell us more about whatnike is doing both internally andexternally to support underrepresentedcommunitieswell um i'm going to start by sharingsomething thatuh that that we say a lot internally atnike andyou you may have you may have heard thisthis analogyother places but um it's been reallyinteresting for me over my 12 years ofbeingat nike to see the way that ourperspectives and our valuesinform the way we connect with consumershow weinvest and the way that we use ourresources in order to be able tocontinue to try to have a positiveimpact oncommunities and the world so we'vealways been focused on equalityand you've heard us you know throughdifferent uh advertising campaignsdo that and it's because we felt likethe voice of the athlete needed to beamplifiedwith that message our athletes caredabout itand so it was core to our values and whowe areand so we we wanted to use our brand andour platform as a megaphoneto be able to say sport by definitionshould befair it should be equal there should benobody who's discriminated against forin wanting to play and i'll never forgetour old ceoused to say this is it was the greatequalizer it was the bestathlete should be the one who wins therace oror you know scores the winning thewinning goalor etcetera and so it's something that'spretty inherent to usbut as we've talked with our consumersand also our athletes our athletesin particular are are our heroines tosome degree and many of themare black and we took a point of viewthatit said that we have got to help toamplify that voice in a meaningful wayum so that we can address some of theissues that existin in sport and then we're broadly insociety in our communitieswe've invested money we've uh in insupport against racial justice but thatif you if that's all it is itmeans hollow and so what um you know weinvest a certain percentage uh two and ahalf percent of ourof our income against initiatives andequality and sport in these other placesum but we have this saying internallythat which is cum sorry say bedo so we need to you know we need tomake sure across that spectrum if youthink about it it's reallyeasy to say hey this is important it's amarketing campaignthe b is really about internally at nikeis the employee's experience in ourcommunities experience within nikeconsistent with what we're sayingand then our actions the things that wechoose to do on a day and day out basisboth internally and externallyfollowing the thread of what we'resaying becauseit would be inauthentic if we saidbut we never weren't living that wayinternally and our actions didn't followwhat we said was important to us and sowe use that frame and we've been usingthat frame over the pastyear especially as issues have spikedand um and there's been more focus andattention on it to make sure that aswe're making decisions about what wesay what we do and where we do itthat it's consistent with our values butthat it's consistent withwith um our behavior and if it's notthen we should sit back and we shouldfix our behavior before we say somethingabout it because it isn't just aboutthe message it's about living our valuesandand our communities and and and ouremployeesand consumers seeing us actingconsistently all the way throughthank you matt um and kind of in asimilar uhvein so a question about supply chainsat niketraceability and transparency andapparel supply chains arecons a constant challenge could youspeak to the work that nike is doing toensurea just and sustainable supply chain andas well nike's role in the broaderindustry in shaping policy andregulationsure well this is a hot topic today andso i'm going to answer the question butit might sound like i'mi'm tiptoeing around around elements ofitum but uh but we believe we should be aleaderin this space and it's one of thereasons why we clearly communicate ourvalues in our impact reportas it relates to the way that we um theway that we responsibly source andsupplyproduct in our supply chain we continueto invest in traceabilityum we we're investing heavily inin like our audit function and the waysthat we follow where we sourceproduct and what we do and we'reconstantly making decisionsabout that that have a negativeconsequence on our profit marginsso a long time ago we made the decisionthat we were going to do what was rightand if it had a negative impact on ourgross margins then it had a negativeimpact on our gross marginsand i know that we chose to stand outand take that leadership positionbecause it was the right thing to do andit doesn't just pertain to forced labororum or other relate or other elements ofthe supply chain that mightdrive down the cost of product it alsopertains tosustainability related measures you knowso so the types of products that we putin our prthe types of materials we put in ourproduct or where we sourcelabor may not be the cheapest um but wedo it because of our valuesand because it's the right thing to doand so we've been making those decisionsfor yearswhen we made our when we put our impactreport out we were very clear aboutthe the efforts that we've put intoplace around traceabilityand we feel very confident um about theactions that we're taking and what we'redoingin terms of the quality of the materialsandum the ways in which those materials areharvested to come into our products but we also recognizefrom a sustainability point of viewthat like i gave you that analogy beforeif you're selling500 500 million pairs of footwear to 750to a billionyou realize that at some point you haveto come up with different ways ofof of creating new materialsinnovation and new materials orinnovations and methods of make ofproductbecause it's just not sustainable toassume that you could the line justcontinues to go up and to the right interms of the impact it hason the ecosystem of materials or laborin certain certain places around theworldso we're investing heavily in newmethods of make of productand in new material sourcesin order to ensure that we're creatingsustainability in in those in thoseareas in which we make productbut it's this is of utmost importance tous and we believeit's intersected with our brand in otherwords if you could makei'll just be really blunt we could makemore money making different decisionsbut we choose to make these becausethey're the right decisions for theplanetand they're the right decisions for ourbrand and at this point those things areinextricably linkedthank you for sharingum so you touched on leading withhumility a bit earlierand as a nike intern last summer i sawleaders show an exceptionalexceptional amount of flexibility andempathy as we all navigated a reallychallenging yeartoday we expect leaders to takeresponsibility not only for employeelivelihood but also for employee liveshow do you see this shifttoward compassionate leadership evolvingover time and how can we prepareourselves to be successful leaders inthe futureit's a great question and i think thislast year has reallytested leadership in so many waysyou know i think since i've been uh aprofessional for the past20 coming up on 22 yearsthe number of leadership books andmodels that i've seen employed that werepopularuh they've probably turned over two orthree times you know there'sbeen different fads and and suggestionsabout what makes a successful leaderbut i think we have a confluence ofevents at this point in time that arereally kind of putting pressure onthe traditional norms of what peopleview as leadersand whether it's you know because iremember when i came out it wasthe big debate was is leadershipsomething you're born with or is itsomething you can learn andand how does that how does that evolveover timeum i fundamentally believe that it'ssomething that you can learnand it's something that you have theopportunity to demonstrateevery day no matter how big your team isor what environment you're operating ini think it starts with knowing your ownpersonal valuesyou have to look within and know whatyour values arebecause they are what's uh what'sspecific to youand if you can can draw strengthfrom your own values you will be a moreauthentic leaderas you engage with the teams than thepeople that you work withif you feel like you're just kind ofyou know you knowcommunicating the corporate parlance orwhatever you know that the corporate uhline um you will you will hit a road atsome point in time wherewhere you feel like it's really hard foryou to go furtherbecause you're you're being asked tolead in a way thatis not consistent with your own values ithink this last year really testedpeople because i'm not sureeverybody would have communicated theirvalues the same way so if you thinkabout it from the pandemicand the isolation and the fear overdeath and the anxiety over beingseparated from people we were allseparated from communities prettyquickly andwhether it was your you know your yourschool communityor your you know like from in my case itwas my kid's school community or it wasyour work environment oryour churches or your mosques orwhatever it would beum or even remember people were afraidto go walk outsideat the beginning of the pandemic and sowe were really cut offand um and then we had the issues youknow that that started to elevate withyou know with george floyd and racialinjustice and the way that these otherissues cameupon us and the election and all ofthese thingsthings that it it's it forced us all tosort of i think look deep withinand figure out what it was that reallycaused us to be in the positions thatwe're in and what we really wantedout of our personal and our professionalrelationshipsand while everybody might not havecommunicated a umyou know a consistent set of valuesacross i'm going to tell you my point ofview and my point of view is is i'm moreoptimisticthan maybe what you read if you justread the headlines in the paper everyday becausewhat i'm seeing is uh i'm not seeing a50 50. i'm seeing more of aa a shared value for people andtreating people respectfully andrecognizing people for who they areand ensuring that people have theopportunity tobring the best of themselves to workevery dayand to me that's not a 50 50 you'reeither in it or you're notthat's a 90 10. and i'm seeing more andmore peoplein that 90 percent in the middlesaying yeah of course that makes senseand that's that'sfor the good of each other and and uhand and for mankind and umand for me that gives me a lot ofoptimism as i look at thewhat we're trying to create and whatwe're trying to do and like i saidearlier on in the conversation wyatt youknow my perspective is thatthese issues are tough issues that we'redealing with andlistening as a leader and showingempathy even when you don't have theanswers is soimportant because especially becausewe're so isolated todayyou don't know how all of these issuesare impacting everybody on your teamand it would be arrogant to assume thatyou do and socreating that space to be able to listenand to hear and to know that you don'talways have the answers but to be ableto put an arm around somebodyand to let them know that you hear themand and that you're processing what theywhat they've told you and you're tryingto figure outhow you can be supportive of them in thecontext of what they're going throughit goes in my experience so far and iknow i'm still young but it'si'm seeing it go have a very favorableimpact and at the end of the day for youthat are graduating from haas you aspireto be a leaderjust one day you aspire to have peoplefollow youand um and you aspire to have people andyou aspire to have an impact on theworldand how you do that is is a question ofhow you get people to follow youfollowership how do you get people tofollow you and your ideas and yourthoughtsand what they want is they want to getto know youand if they can get to know you they cansee where that shared value is andwhen you start to to give them visionand direction for where you want to leadand where you want to goyou've created a connection with them ina different way than justa traditional boss to employee orpeer-to-peer relationship you'veyou've created a connection that's builton something that's more solid than thatmatt thank you so much umthat is so powerful and it reallyresonates withso many of us listening to you umthat that concludes uh our our studentquestionand i really want to thank our studentstessand i and dtf for really powerfulquestions andmatt thank you so much for your candorand your honesty and your humility andyour brilliance we really appreciate itum so much and we're so proud to callyou an alumnow we're going to transition to somequestions from the audienceum so if that's okay i'll start with thefirst oneso this one is from patrick covinoso patrick writes as cfocan you speak a bit more about how youthinkthrough and ultimately make decisionsrelated to technology investments andinvestments in talentso for example how do you make adecision about hiring an engineerversus hiring people in salesit's a good question and uhand one of the biggest responsibilitiesi have at the company isto help develop our strategyfirst and foremost and ensure that we'vegot clearmeasures and metrics that tell us on amonthly and quarterly and annual basiswhether we're making progress againstour strategybut secondly how we allocate resourcesacross the companyso one of the biggest elements of my jobis cap is our capital planningand ultimately where we choose to investin order to drive our long-term strategyand our returnsum usually the the distinction isn't soclearin terms of an engineer versus the salesperson umuh but often times it around those bigboulders of strategywhere you're trying to make significantshifts in where the company is going tohave impactas you look three to five years out anddetermining what resources are requiredi have to use the skills that i learnedat haas and the skills that i learned ininvestmentbanking to evaluate roi of the decisionsthat we take and so you know our teamhas responsibility for helping to builda business case and to be clear onwhat's really required and how we paceand phase those investments so that weensure that we're building and drivingretentionand um and uh and and a return oninvestment over time but we also spend alot of time talking about the way thatour workforce is changing so if i getspecific to hryou know we're constantly havingconversations about the way thattechnology is changing our workforceand what people who are graduating fromhaas todayexpect in the work environment and whatskills and experiences and tools theybringrelative to maybe what it was like wheni graduated i mean i remember when igraduated in 99i got a desktop computer there was nolaptop there were no mobile phones yetor at least maybe like the partner on onthe team had a mobile phone but none ofus had mobile phoneswe had pagers in order to connect andand to be found when they neededus and so the world has changed a lotin 20-something years but i spent a lotof timeconnecting those decisions to ourstrategy and then we built our resourceplans against itso everything starts with a very clearvision and strategic plan of where we'regoing as a companyand then we build our business plansunderneath itso that we ensure that we're allocatingour resourceresources and we're and we're aligningthe goals and the objectives of thebroader organization againstachieving that long-term strategythanks matt that that makes so muchsense umthe next question isum anand would love to know nike'sdecision-making process when it comesto backing a respective athleteum as a consumer anon loved how nikebackeduh kaepernick up but what were themetrics or discussion pointswell i wish i could i could assure youthat it waslike a scientific processsometimes it is and sometimes it is aconversation across four or five of uson the leadership teamdeciding whether we think this is theright thing for us to do at this pointin timein in the moment umwhat we always come back to are ourthree corevalues okay our three core values as acompany are equalityum access to sport for youth and theplanetand those are the three lenses that weputon these different social issues as theycome upand we talk about whether speaking tothese issues isis uniquely nike's position or whetherit's just a corporation thathas a lot of resources and a brandthat's recognized and we're just talkingto a matter becauseit's a hot topic for today so we reallytry to use that filter of those threesubjectsin order to determine whether it'suniquely important for niketo speak at this particular point intime or notand then i think the last thing i wouldsay just goes back to what i mentionedin a priorin the prior chat which is that beuh that say be do becauseif we don't believe that we're behavingthis wayinternally then we shouldn't be outspeaking about it just because we canbecause we feel like that's notauthentic to who we arethank you for that um thank you uhnow we have a question from jeff diamondjeff asks what are the most importantproduct areas that nike is focusing onto transform traditional productsinto sustainable productswell it's mostly in the materials spaceso umwhen we look at our products we havewe have two big drivers of the cost ofour product that also have animpact on the environment in which weoperateyou can maybe argue three but it's it'smaterials and the cost of materialsand the accessibility of materials in aworld where there's more and more demandfor nikeand for other consumer brands that aretrying tofully get access to those materials toput in their productand then the second piece is labor andyou could say well is laborlabor is a quantity of um or aquantification ofthe amount of labor that's used in aproduct and the ratewe focus on the amount of product oflabor that's made in a proproduct which forces us to innovate innew ways of manufacturingso that we don't have to rely upon asmuch human labor to be able to createour productsso we're focused on technology and theway technology enables us to innovatethe way products are madeso that we don't have so that we don'thave to constantly rely upon moreum more labor uh to make our productsand then we're constantly focused on theinnovation of the way thatwhat we put into our products so thatwe're not constantly depleting theworld's water resourcesor relying upon differentelements of the make of materials likecotton andother chemicals and things that havehistorically gone into the products thatwe makewhich are not great for the environmentso those products that i referenced inour prior conversation whether it wasthe space hippieor cosmic unity um as examples ofproducts most recently that aresustainable or what we're doing inapparelwe're focused very heavily on thatmaterials element of what goes into ourproductso that we can try to close the loop ofwhat we're doing so that at some pointin theory we could either take wastefrom other industriesand transform that into materials thatgo into our productsor we can take back the products thatwe've made and have been usedand revert them back to their to a to ato a sourcethat we can then utilize in our productsthanks so much matt that's sointeresting umand that's very much what you've beenfocusing on is very much consistent withmy three priorities uh leading haaswhich has beeninnovation inclusion and sustainabilityso thateverything that you're saying resonatesso much so now we have a question that'squite differenton a totally different note from waleedhamidasks what are the top three skills thatyou learned athaas that helped you navigate thedifferentcareers and positions that you've hadwell i i would say that the three wouldbeum one as i mentioned at the starti had never had the opportunity at leastat my time at caland before to work in groupsand that teamwork that gets created fromworking in groupsand making mistakes this worked thisdidn'twho took the lead who who volunteered totake on a certain responsibilitythat was all new muscle for me butincredibly valuable as i got out intothe working world because you'realways you'll never not work on a teamagain might seem like you're at timesan individual contributor but you willnever not be part of a teamyou know as you work towards the futureand so that was hugely valuablethe second was humility because i wassurrounded by incredibly smart peopleand i was grateful every day that i wasin classbut i also got to see sometimes wherepeople's pride and arrogance sort oflike took him in a direction that didn'twant people to follow him and i thoughtto myselfyou know what there's a different waythat i want to engageand and and be a part of a team versusumand be part of the team versus standingout and maybe trying to show everybodythat you know the answers to everythingor otherwise and soit wasn't that i got the experience buti got to witness it andit had an impact on me in terms of interms of what i was doingand then the third thing i would justsay is you're building an incrediblenetworkat haas and those relationships andthose connection points are so importantand you'll be tempted as you go to workin a new companyas you graduate to focus on what thatcompany doesand i would just encourage you to stayopen and listen and stay connectedbecauseyou learn so much from challenges andobstacles that other industries faceand their company's face other peersface and you canyou can shamelessly borrow thoseexperiences andapply them to what you're going throughat any given point in timeand figure out how you might respond tothe situation and uhand you know i was fortunate to have alot of haasalums working at goldman and morganstanley over my time of being therebut honestly when i got to nike i gotnike has a tendency to be a little bitinsular in terms of like we make it herewe do this hereand so i went for a while kind of likegoing dim on my networkand in hindsight and i wish i didn't letthat happenand i've had to amp it back up in mymore senior roles at the company becauseyou just realizeyou can't figure it all out here you canleverage the relationships and theconnection pointsto help influence what you're trying toaccomplishthanks thanks so much it's great to hearthat you're amping backup your your haas network we're reallyexcited to hear that umthis is actually we only have time forone last questionum and this is a question from jezreelboadleyum jezreel asks can you share any advicethat you might havefor undergraduates who are about tograduateand enter the working worldwell what i would say is is focuson finding mentors and people who aregoing to take aninterest in your career development forthe long termwhen you make that first decision to goworkyou're going to be balancing a decisionof a brand value of a companyor people who you feel like you're youcan connect withand follow and have and and learn andgrow and develop fromand i would just say that as you buildyour careerit's finding those people who championand support youand your development long termwill be the most impact from you but ifyou fast forward 20 years and you lookbacki assure you that you won't talk aboutthe names of the companiesas like the how i got here you'll talkabout the peoplewho you worked with who gave youopportunitieswho invested in you who challenged youto think about things in different waysthat enabled you to get to where you areand umthe sooner you you learn that and youprocess thati think it gives you perspective as yougo through the first hard years ofworking when you're out on your ownthank you so much so for everyone wehavejust heard from matt friend the chieffinancialofficer executive vice president at nikeand a

excitement you would think anair max update would createsoon to be another forgotten air max theair max 2090 will suffer the same fateas a lot of airmax models that have beenreleased over the yearsin this video we'll be taking a closerlook at the history behind one of thoseforgotten air max modelsthe air max 98 hello everybody andwelcome back to the channel if you'renew here my name is brianand my brother nacho and i make videoson sneaker history and all thingsrelated to sneaker cultureso if you're into sneakers then youmight want to consider subscribing tothis channel because we make contentlike this all the timeand you're not going to want to miss anupload all right guys with that out ofthe waylet's get into the history of the airmax 98 in 1998pokemon had just released in the u.s andthe country was sitting on the couchwatching the bill clinton and monicalewinsky scandal unfoldnike on the other hand was focused onkeeping its customers excitedthey had just released the air max 97with a nearly full360 visible air bubble and expectationswere high for what they would do nextthis is where footwear designer sergiolozano came into playsergio lozano is a designer responsiblefor one of nike's greatest shoes of alltimeactually my favorite nike shoe ever theair max 95the air max 95 was groundbreakingbecause it featured an air unit in theforefoot of the chute and was inspiredby human anatomynow in 1998 three years after the launchof the air max 95lozano wanted to play on the 95shortcomings and design a new shootbut drastic changes had already beenmade on the air max line since lozanolast workedon it the air max 96 which also featuredairin both the heel and the forefoot of theshoe was a huge departure from his workon the air max 95and the air max 97's futuristic silverbullet aestheticalong with its debut of a fully visibleair unit made it tough for lozano tofollow upby the way i know a lot of you guys haveprobably never seen the air max 96beforeit's a pretty crazy looking shoe rightthe air max 98featured a synthetic leather and meshupper that was quite bulkyfor an air max shoe sergio lozano addedvertically ripped side walls which weresimilar to the 95 but these rib sidewalls were a little thinner thesilhouette used the same exact fulllength air unit from the air max 97and the air max 98 complex lacing systemwas informed by lozano's time working onnike'sacg program all conditions gear if youdidn't know what that stands for the airmax 98 released in early 1998in several launch colorways but the onethat we refer to as the og colorwaythese daysis the red white and varsity blue pairalso known as the air max 98 gundamlegend has it the colorway was inspiredby the widely popular japanese anime ofthe 70s and 80s calledgundam a military science fiction animethat features giant robot suitsone of which was named the rx-782 whichlozano tookinspiration from but there's no officialcollaboration between gundam and nikeas the year went on nike would releaseseveral colorways of the 98including kids versions which featuredthe air max 95 soul instead of the airmax 97 soulunfortunately the price point was one ofthe many factors that contributed to theair max 98's failureretailing at 150 dollars making it themost expensive shoe in nike's catalogat the time for context 150 is about 225dollars todayanother factor that played into itsdownfall was the fact that the airmax 98 had to compete with the newlyreleased and incredibly successful airmax plus which came out the same yearthe air max plus also known as the airmax plus tnofficially debuted tuned air nike'spremium cushioning technology at thetimethe air max 98 featured tuned air aswell but it wasn't necessarily a sellingpoint for its releasearound the same time nike also releaseda variation of the shoe that's worthnotingthe air max 98 tl which featured amodified air unit with additionalsegmentationand a redesigned upper it was justanother silhouette that drew attentionaway from the air max 98 that sergiolozano originally designedbefore the year could even end the airmax 98was already appearing on sale racks andretailers across the countrybut even at the reduced price peoplestill weren't buying the 98and it was quickly forgotten asconsumers moved on to the next thingor in some cases they just opted forbuying new colorways of the air max 95and air max 97 and who could blame themit wouldn't be until march 201416 years after its debut that we wouldsee the first ever retroof the air max 98 the first retrorelease was the white total orange andmetallic pairbut throughout the rest of 2014 nikeretroed other colorways of the 98and in 2016 with supreme hype at anall-time highnike and supreme partnered up to do apack of four air max 98sinspired by

"we started this two years ago and ourtask was to build the best sports brasin the world what's really exciting atNike is that we have the ability toresearch and analyze every sportwe spoke to 1,100 athletes around theworld we learned that their favoritesports bra was a very simple silhouettehad very limited details on it it wasabout simplicity and keeping hercomfortable we developed five sportsupport designs each of those bras gofrom compressive support to fullyencapsulated support no adjustment tomulti adjustment and low support to highsupportwe had to really develop a mechanicalmethod that could be reliable and wecould test bus at any time during thedevelopment processsee how strong it is the back and chestof the female body swept the most overany other part of the body the firstthing we did is we developed abreathable zone on the bra so the entirecenter back is actually breathablethe cup area of the bra is our moisturemanagement zone so what you'll see isour materials have been designedspecifically to suck more and moremoisture off the body the chest ban inparticular has a new construction andwithin that construction it allows us tostitch the moisture management fabric onthe outside of the bra so there's not aseam chafing against the body itstretches it is durable over time and itcan get on and off the body with easeone of the things that we did was lookat the type of thread but also the useof the thread in the bra but we werevery cognizant of the type of stitcheswe used we wanted to reduce the risk ofchafing we also wanted to make the bralighter in weight so on all the bras youwill see that now all the trim itemshave gone to a zig-zag stitchapplication and in some cases we reducedthe weight by 10%we developed a fabric underwire thatutilizes fabric and bonding or moldingin some cases where we can minimize thethickness of the bra but create theunder band support to actually providethe encapsulation support the fullyencapsulated bra has a separate utilitypatent on the method of how it's moldedas we were going through the designprocess we discovered that one of thesamples that came from the factory was amolded part that today would tell us wasa mistake in the part that had a overuseof molding into space or mash but we sawit as something beautiful because we sawthe simplicity and the molding and alsowe recognized it creates support in theproduct and what this allowed us to dowas really to create the first sportsbra in the world that was molded at avery high level support that didn'tinvolve stitching it didn'texcessive layers of material it providedsomething that was simple for theathlete and also provided something veryiconic tonightas a result of this two-year process wehave developed the most informedthoughtful and innovative bra series onthe market",17,UCLTjLew9q3SwrkpX0cGZPzA,eukicks,3,2,0,51,"['Sports Bra', 'Nike', 'Apparel', 'Nike Victory Bra']",Nike Victory Bra Series,atS2aYO3y4A,27051

60 to 61to 62 to 63 to 64 to 65 to 66 to 67 6869 70 - 70 this is so ridiculous - 71 to72 to 73 to 74 to 75 to 76 to 77 to 78to 79 to 82 81 82 83 84 85Oh85 and I just lost - to 85there they are zoom to 86 wait 35 to 85better than Burnett 285 285 286 287 8889 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 andrude Wow a little mistakes on those onesfrom 50 to 60 I just started countingone two three refresh and in my head I'mlike why did you start doing that but Icouldn't say things I don't throw up thenumber all right 300 we are at 300 witha few more to go every time there's abreak in it I feel like my mind can stopand think for a secondWow by the way we have a clock righthere it's 1041 a.m. so just so you know like it'snot jump petting how long it actuallytakes I know the videos gonna be inlength but also so you know there's nolike movie editing magic that makes mechange things but so if I have the clockthere that works this camera has fourhours in like 20 minutes remaining onthe charge not on the charge on the SDcard so I kind of have to finish beforethat otherwise I'll have to get outanother camera and like swap it out andI really don't want to swap it out Iwant this to be all in one take so thatyou guys know I really count on how manythere are because that's important andspend time doing this you need to knowthat it's legit all right 300 301 302303 304 305 306 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 this one is the 13 17 18 19 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 3536 37 38 39 4041 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 so 350we're at 350 right now 350 this is anice little way to do it here 351 350250 350 3 3 3 54 355 356 it's harder tocount with the hundreds 57 58 359 360361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 69 70 71through to do374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 3833 84 85 86 87 88 89 93 93 91 92 93 94 9596 97 98 99 100 or not 100 400 we got400 little balls little Joyride ballsthat's 400 baby boom 400 maybe once Iget to like 500 I'll mix them alltogether and put them in like one bag orsomething that sounds smart I don't knowthe other hundred coming up I don'tthink I've met the ziplocs to do thatmany okay we are at 400 are you enjoyingthis are you loving this right now soI'm so glad you're watching this rightnow and enjoying me counting the ballsfor those of you that are actuallywatching good job way to watch way to beI hope that you're into this as much asI amfour hundred and one two three four fivesix four oh seven eight nine 10 11 for12 13 14 15 16 17 18four hundred and eighteen nineteentwenty twenty-one so for 21 22 23 24 2526 so for 26in seven 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 it's at4 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 I like thisway for 32 33 34 36 35 just forget itforget it I messed up my couldn'tremember if it was in the 40 that's whyI was stuttering oh that's sofrustrating when you get to a number andyou're just like did I just go from 29to 30 or 29 to 40 I think I messed it upI think I jump because like your mind issomewhere else and especially when I'msaying like the four or something versusjust like 1 2 3 but I would imagine ifsome of you are like skipping forward inthis video you want to be able to hearwhat number it's at when I'm doing itversus just me counting the 100 200 orwhatever so anyway 400 starting over Iknow it's just just frustrating for meas it is for you that I have to start at401 again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31 3233 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42okay 42 42 so 442 4-3 44 45 46 47 48 4950 51 52 5354 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 6667 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 7980 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 9293 94 95 96 97 98 99 we wonjust 1 100 so that's 500 I think I'vekind of given up on trying to say likethe big number in it I'm just gonnastick with the 100 per pouch so you'llknow every time that I finished one ofthese pouches I'm gonna tell you howmany there arewe've got 1 2 3 4 5 500 because honestlyis too confusing to say all the numbersall in a row without like looking atnumbers on a screen or something it'sjust too tricky so 500I know it's simple math but when you'redoing it story peda bibley I can get itwait there's 5 punish it put it in onebag but no let's do a thousand once weget to a thousand we're gonna do athousand thank you for giving thatcomment right now know now that I saw itbut I kind of imagine some of you sayingbehind the scenes no do it thousandsbags of a

thousand and then we're gonnaput them all into one baggie and seewhat it looks like so quite a few leftin here but I'm feeling a little moreoptimistic we can do this we candefinitely do this psyching myself uphere okay so we're at 900 there we go Iwas gonna guess mm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 2324 25 26 27 28 2930 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 4243 44 45 46 47 48 49

five six seven eight nine boomthousand we got a thousand we have to athousand so any of you that said theythought they were less than a thousandinside of this shoe you were way offbecause there's way more than a thousandin here so now we are going to verydelicately take all of them in here andput them into here is that a dumb ideaprobably probably because we don't wantto spill them if we spill them that'svery sad let's do thiswhy did I just dump a hundred of theminto a fresh bag I could've just startedwith a hundred and just gone with it I'mnot smart sometimes okay one bag let'sput all the bags there so I'll probablylose track of how many bags yeah okayhere's that 200 onesall right 200 there's a jackhammeroutside this is what is this New YorkCityneighbors are digging a pool next doorit's crazy loud all right here's the 300going in there close all right there's300but I don't get as if in jackhammeringfor like a month nowlike how much jackhammering do you doall right here's 400 okay 400five hundredbut the six hundred and a come on comeon don't fall out guysnicely fall into the back so you got doguys okaysix hundred yes there's a seven hundredjust so tedious but I think this is theway to do it we got to be accurate hereI know we're know like Arnstein youngaccounting firm here but this is uh I dohave an accounting degree so maybe thathelps me count little balls all thoseyears of college for this kidsokay alright three more bags three morebags and we got one bag of a thousand Ithink that's a good it's a goodmilestone makes me think there'sprobably like four or five thousand inthereso hot in here so hot in here I don'treally think I think she when I saidturn down the air I think she meant shethought that I meant make it hot but Ireally meant make it cold turn down theair okayI'll say you hunter in there let's getnine hundred come on nine hundred let'sdo it get in there get in the back getin there little guys okay and then thelast one can't believe we're making awhole video about this wonder what thewatch time is gonna be on this like howmany of you are actually watchingcertain parts of this because I wouldimagine a lot of you guys are justjumping around just to figure out whatit is and find some fun moments if youare watching right now go ahead andcomment down below and tell me what timeit ishow long this videos been so I don'tknow

supposed to go in here he'sprobably like oh no they're supposed tobe this many exactly and now they'retesting it out to see how many thereactually are to be like one of thosethings like when you're a subway or likea restaurant and they put these or pizzaplaces like Pizza Hut Little Caesarswhere they put the exact amount ofpepperonis and everything on there tosave costs would imagine with theseNikes they don't just like fill it fullprobably like have a certain numberthat's like this is the number we'resupposed to have in it try to get tothis much so we don't use too many andcost more

go and do closedcaptions for this it'll probably costlike it's usually like a dollar a minuteto pay for closed captions to be donethis thing's gonna be like a couplehundred bucks a few hundred bucks justfor the closed captions to be done onthis and it's just gonna be some persongoing through the entire video addingthe numbers looks almost as painful aslike actually counting them that's funnystill beautiful day out there nice andsunny nice September day SeptemberOctober whenever you see this I'llprobably be in September or maybe eventhe 1st of October we were actuallygoing to post a video to

and got it out of my email anduploaded that bad boy but I've beendoing this and now we are missing ourupload window but we got to know theanswer to this will this video get anyviews probably not

gonice come on there we go a couple morebut yeah what videos you guys want tosee before the end of the year whatwhat's inside videos do you want to seewhat things should we take open orshould we keep making tons of videos onour family channel it's a weird timewhere Family Channel is actually doingsome respects better than the mainchannel we've got the main channel for areally long timeso sometimes it makes me think wellmaybe we just take a pause from the mainchannel and just keep working on thefamily stuff you guys seem to reallylike that stuff and then wheneversomething super interesting like thisNike shoe comes out then of course wecould do some video on that the weightedblankets crazy interesting I don't knowif as many people watch it but it'scrazy cool interesting and then here wego 1 2

38 39 30 31 youknow like you repeat but I'm pretty sureI'm pretty accurate if I was wrong you'dhave to prove me wrong and tell me theexact timestamp moment when I did but8000 69 little joy right balls areinside of a Nike Joyride shoe to makeone of the most comfortable shoes that Ihave everWarren and I'm gonna start wearing theseworking out and see what they're likeactually being active because justwalking around it's like softer thanslippers it is so stinking comfortableso Nike Joyride their running shoespretty dang cool but what we're gonna dois we're gonna find whoever a commentwe're gonna search for eight thousandsixty nine and if somebody gets thatexact thing then they're going to get afree Joyride we're just gonna buy someMLM to you contact you and so and if notthen if nobody chose that number we'regoing to choose whoever is closest tothat number I don't care if it's aboveor below it I don't my game showsgetting mad if you go above but whoeveris the closest 806 8,000 sixty-nine youget a free pair we're gonna reach out toyou and then he'll let us know what youthought about this oh I think I shouldlet the kids get the reaction I mightget the kids reactions and put

inside of them really reallyinteresting shoe if you haven't seenthat video you go watch it on our mainchannel I'll link it right up here andin the description but Lincoln decidedthat it would be really fun and funny ifI was kind of like what mr. beast usedto do and he would like read thedictionary and stuff rather than justcount these and tell you how many are init he wanted me to read all of these andnot stop the camera and so you could seeme counting every one of these thousandsof little balls somehow I decided toagree to this and so that's what thisvideo is going to be I'm gonna countevery single one of these and see howmany is in it and the person that getsthe closest based off of our mainchannel video that we put up is going toactually win a pair of these that we'regoing to ship to them not a sponsorvideo we're just going to buy them forsomebody because that's pretty crazy ifthey guessed within the first four dayshow many would actually be inside ofhere so yeah let's get started thisvideo is not gonna stop it's just gonnabe me sitting here I'm gonna count putthem inside of the cup and I think I'mgonna count them in hundreds and thenonce I have a hundred put them inside ofa ziploc bag and then I don't know howlong this is gonna take me I mean listento these things they're so cool-lookingthey're so bouncy and this really isevery single one of them from this shoeright herewe took some out of this shoe but wedidn't actually keep we just kept thoseoff to the side so yeahare you ready to get going how long isthis gonna take and how many are gonnabe in hereI don't know is this the most boringvideo we've ever made maybe but this iswhere I am you're gonna see me countinga lot okay one oh my gosh they're sobouncytwo three four five they're so bouncywell know

86 wait 35 to 85better than Burnett 285 285 286 287 8889 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 andrude Wow a little mistakes on those onesfrom 50 to 60 I just started countingone two three refresh and in my head I'mlike why did you start doing that but Icouldn't say things I don't throw up thenumber all right 300 we are at 300 witha few more to go every time there's abreak in it I feel like my mind can stopand think for a secondWow by the way we have a clock righthere it's 1041 a.m. so just so you know like it'snot jump petting how long it actuallytakes I know the videos gonna be inlength but also so you know there's nolike movie editing magic that makes mechange things but so if I have the clockthere that works this camera has fourhours in like 20 minutes remaining onthe charge not on the charge on the SDcard so I kind of have to finish beforethat otherwise I'll have to get outanother camera and like swap it out andI really don't want to swap it out Iwant this to be all in one take so thatyou guys know I really count on how manythere are because that's important andspend time doing this you need to knowthat it's legit all right 300 301 302303 304 305 306 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 this one is the 13 17 18 19 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 3536 37 38 39 4041 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 so 350we're at 350 right now 350 this is anice little way to do it here 351 350250 350 3 3 3 54 355 356 it's harder tocount with the hundreds 57 58 359 360361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 69 70 71through to do374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 3833 84 85 86 87 88 89 93 93 91 92 93 94 9596 97 98 99 100 or not 100 400 we got400 little balls little Joyride ballsthat's 400 baby boom 400 maybe once Iget to like 500 I'll mix them alltogether and put them in like one bag orsomething that sounds smart I don't knowthe other hundred coming up I don'tthink I've met the ziplocs to do thatmany okay we are at 400 are you enjoyingthis are you loving this right now soI'm so glad you're watching this rightnow and enjoying me counting the ballsfor those of you that are actuallywatching good job way to watch way to beI hope that you're into this as much asI amfour hundred and one two three four fivesix four oh seven eight nine 10 11 for12 13 14 15 16 17 18four hundred and eighteen nineteentwenty twenty-one so for 21 22 23 24 2526 so for 26in seven 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 it's at4 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 I like thisway for 32 33 34 36 35 just forget itforget it I messed up my couldn'tremember if it was in the 40 that's whyI was stuttering oh that's sofrustrating when you get to a number andyou're just like did I just go from 29to 30 or 29 to 40 I think I messed it upI think I jump because like your mind issomewhere else and especially when I'msaying like the four or something versusjust like 1 2 3 but I would imagine ifsome of you are like skipping forward inthis video you want to be able to hearwhat number it's at when I'm doing itversus just me counting the 100 200 orwhatever so anyway 400 starting over Iknow it's just just frustrating for meas it is for you that I have to start at401 again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31 3233 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42okay 42 42 so 442 4-3 44 45 46 47 48 4950 51 52 5354 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 6667 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 7980 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 9293 94 95 96 97 98 99 we wonjust 1 100 so that's 500 I think I'vekind of given up on trying to say likethe big number in it I'm just gonnastick with the 100 per pouch so you'llknow every time that I finished one ofthese pouches I'm gonna tell you howmany there arewe've got 1 2 3 4 5 500 because honestlyis too confusing to say all the numbersall in a row without like looking atnumbers on a screen or something it'sjust too tricky so 500I know it's simple math but when you'redoing it story peda bibley I can get itwait there's 5 punish it put it in onebag but no let's do a thousand once weget to a thousand we're gonna do athousand thank you for giving thatcomment right now know now that I saw itbut I kind of imagine some of you sayingbehind the scenes no do it thousandsbags of a

thousand and then we're gonnaput them all into one baggie and seewhat it looks like so quite a few leftin here but I'm feeling a little moreoptimistic we can do this we candefinitely do this psyching myself uphere okay so we're at 900 there we go Iwas gonna guess mm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 2324 25 26 27 28 2930 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 4243 44 45 46 47 48 49

five six seven eight nine boomthousand we got a thousand we have to athousand so any of you that said theythought they were less than a thousandinside of this shoe you were way offbecause there's way more than a thousandin here so now we are going to verydelicately take all of them in here andput them into here is that a dumb ideaprobably probably because we don't wantto spill them if we spill them that'svery sad let's do thiswhy did I just dump a hundred of theminto a fresh bag I could've just startedwith a hundred and just gone with it I'mnot smart sometimes okay one bag let'sput all the bags there so I'll probablylose track of how many bags yeah okayhere's that 200 onesall right 200 there's a jackhammeroutside this is what is this New YorkCityneighbors are digging a pool next doorit's crazy loud all right here's the 300going in there close all right there's300but I don't get as if in jackhammeringfor like a month nowlike how much jackhammering do you doall right here's 400 okay 400five hundredbut the six hundred and a come on comeon don't fall out guysnicely fall into the back so you got doguys okaysix hundred yes there's a seven hundredjust so tedious but I think this is theway to do it we got to be accurate hereI know we're know like Arnstein youngaccounting firm here but this is uh I dohave an accounting degree so maybe thathelps me count little balls all thoseyears of college for this kidsokay alright three more bags three morebags and we got one bag of a thousand Ithink that's a good it's a goodmilestone makes me think there'sprobably like four or five thousand inthereso hot in here so hot in here I don'treally think I think she when I saidturn down the air I think she meant shethought that I meant make it hot but Ireally meant make it cold turn down theair okayI'll say you hunter in there let's getnine hundred come on nine hundred let'sdo it get in there get in the back getin there little guys okay and then thelast one can't believe

7,000of them all togetherWow guysWow Wow Wow to all of you 20 people whomight still be watching at this pointthat's pretty awesome that's surprisingI hope that you were doing somethingelse also while you're watching this ifyou are somebody that lives outside theUnited States and maybe you wanted tolearn your numbers this was a good wayto learn your numbers today what's gonnabe funny is I'm gonna go and do closedcaptions for this it'll probably costlike it's usually like a dollar a minuteto pay for closed captions to be donethis thing's gonna be like a couplehundred bucks a few hundred bucks justfor the closed captions to be done onthis and it's just gonna be some persongoing through the entire video addingthe numbers looks almost as painful aslike actually counting them that's funnystill beautiful day out there nice andsunny nice September day SeptemberOctober whenever you see this I'llprobably be in September or maybe eventhe 1st of October we were actuallygoing to post a video to the mainchannel today the weighted blanket videoit's probably out by now and we itwasn't that it wasn't finished thismorning it's probably done like rightwhen I started this and I could havejust gone and got it out of my email anduploaded that bad boy but I've beendoing this and now we are missing ourupload window but we got to know theanswer to this will this video get anyviews probably not probably not which iskind of crazy that I would be doing thisand spending an entire day what is myvalue per hour rate to be doing thislet's say my rate is like a thousandballs an hour okay here we gonice come on there we go a couple morebut yeah what videos you guys want tosee before the end of the year whatwhat's inside videos do you want to seewhat things should we take open orshould we keep making tons of videos onour family channel it's a weird timewhere Family Channel is actually doingsome respects better than the mainchannel we've got the main channel for areally long timeso sometimes it makes me think wellmaybe we just take a pause from the mainchannel and just keep working on thefamily stuff you guys seem to reallylike that stuff and then wheneversomething super interesting like thisNike shoe comes out then of course wecould do some video on that the weightedblankets crazy interesting I don't knowif as many people watch it but it'scrazy cool interesting and then here wego 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 thousand so far we'reinside of just one of these little shoesthat's crazythat is crazy ok so we got to get onemore baggie out let's count them up makesure we've got 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Ialways kind of do that so I don't haveto what if I did too many and thenwhatever so that's good good oh you seethat how much is left is that a thousandis that a couple thousand I don't thinkit's a couple thousand I think we'reclose that's seven thousand right therewill we reach eight thousand it's gonnabe close it's gonna be close here we go1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1617 18 19 20 21

inside of them really reallyinteresting shoe if you haven't seenthat video you go watch it on our mainchannel I'll link it right up here andin the description but Lincoln decidedthat it would be really fun and funny ifI was kind of like what mr. beast usedto do and he would like read thedictionary and stuff rather than justcount these and tell you how many are init he wanted me to read all of these andnot stop the camera and so you could seeme counting every one of these thousandsof little balls somehow I decided toagree to this and so that's what thisvideo is going to be I'm gonna countevery single one of these and see howmany is in it and the person that getsthe closest based off of our mainchannel video that we put up is going toactually win a pair of these that we'regoing to ship to them not a sponsorvideo we're just going to buy them forsomebody because that's pretty crazy ifthey guessed within the first four dayshow many would actually be inside ofhere so yeah let's get started thisvideo is not gonna stop it's just gonnabe me sitting here I'm gonna count putthem inside of the cup and I think I'mgonna count them in hundreds and thenonce I have a hundred put them inside ofa ziploc bag and then I don't know howlong this is gonna take me I mean listento these things they're so cool-lookingthey're so bouncy and this really isevery single one of them from this shoeright herewe took some out of this shoe but wedidn't actually keep we just kept thoseoff to the side so yeahare you ready to get going how long isthis gonna take and how many are gonnabe in hereI

21[Music]22 23 24 25 26 27 8 9 30 31 32 33 34 34we're not gonna mess it up this timeonce we get to this 34 we're at 234 235236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 45 46 4 748 49 50 250 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 60 to 61to 62 to 63 to 64 to 65 to 66 to 67 6869 70 - 70 this is so ridiculous - 71 to72 to 73 to 74 to 75 to 76 to 77 to 78to 79 to 82 81 82 83 84 85Oh85 and I just lost - to 85there they are zoom to 86 wait 35 to 85better than Burnett 285 285 286 287 8889 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 andrude Wow a little mistakes on those onesfrom 50 to 60 I just started countingone two three refresh and in my head I'mlike why did you start doing that but Icouldn't say things I don't throw up thenumber all right 300 we are at 300 witha few more to go every time there's abreak in it I feel like my mind can stopand think for a secondWow by the way we have a clock righthere it's 1041 a.m. so just so you know like it'snot jump petting how long it actuallytakes I know the videos gonna be inlength but also so you know there's nolike movie editing magic that makes mechange things but so if I have the clockthere that works this camera has fourhours in like 20 minutes remaining onthe charge not on the charge on the SDcard so I kind of have to finish beforethat otherwise I'll have to get outanother camera and like swap it out andI really don't want to swap it out Iwant this to be all in one take so thatyou guys know I really count on how manythere are because that's important andspend time doing this you need to knowthat it's legit all right 300 301 302303 304 305 306 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 this one is the 13 17 18 19 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 3536 37 38 39 4041 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 so 350we're at 350 right now 350 this is anice little way to do it here 351 350250 350 3 3 3 54 355 356 it's harder tocount with the hundreds 57 58 359 360361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 69 70 71through to do374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 3833 84 85 86 87 88 89 93 93 91 92 93 94 9596 97 98 99 100 or not 100 400 we got400 little balls little Joyride ballsthat's 400 baby boom 400 maybe once Iget to like 500 I'll mix them alltogether and put them in like one bag orsomething that sounds smart I don't knowthe other hundred coming up I don'tthink I've met the ziplocs to do thatmany okay we are at 400 are you enjoyingthis are you loving this right now soI'm so glad you're watching this rightnow and enjoying me counting the ballsfor those of you that are actuallywatching good job way to watch way to beI hope that you're into this as much asI amfour hundred and one two three four fivesix four oh seven eight nine 10 11 for12 13 14 15 16 17 18four hundred and eighteen nineteentwenty twenty-one so for 21 22 23 24 2526 so for 26in seven 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 it's at4 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 I like thisway for 32 33 34 36 35 just forget itforget it I messed up my couldn'tremember if it was in the 40 that's whyI was stuttering oh that's sofrustrating when you get to a number andyou're just like did I just go from 29to 30 or 29 to 40 I think I messed it upI think I jump because like your mind issomewhere else and especially when I'msaying like the four or something versusjust like 1 2 3 but I would imagine ifsome of you are like skipping forward inthis video you want to be able to hearwhat number it's at when I'm doing itversus just me counting the 100 200 orwhatever so anyway 400 starting over Iknow it's just just frustrating for meas it is for you that I have to start at401 again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31 3233 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42okay 42 42 so 442 4-3 44 45 46 47 48 4950 51 52 5354 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 6667 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 7980 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 9293 94 95 96 97 98 99 we wonjust 1 100 so that's 500 I think I'vekind of given up on trying to say likethe big number in it I'm just gonnastick with the 100 per pouch so you'llknow every time that I finished one ofthese pouches I'm gonna tell you howmany there arewe've got 1 2 3 4 5 500 because honestlyis too confusing to say all the numbersall in a row without like looking atnumbers on a screen or something it'sjust too tricky so 500I know it's simple math but when you'redoing it story peda bibley I can get itwait there's 5 punish it put it in onebag but no let's do a thousand once weget to a thousand we're gonna do athousand thank you for giving thatcomment right now know now that I saw itbut I kind of imagine some of you sayingbehind the scenes no do it thousandsbags of a thousand so yeah I'm alreadylosing it I'm losing it it's like I feellike you guys are talking to meencouraging me to keep going so what dowe go10:51 all right there we go so fivehundred five hundred

thousand and then we're gonnaput them all into one baggie and seewhat it looks like so quite a few leftin here but I'm feeling a little moreoptimistic we can do this we candefinitely do this psyching myself uphere okay so we're at 900 there we go Iwas gonna guess mm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 2324 25 26 27 28 2930 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 4243 44 45 46 47 48 49

five six seven eight nine boomthousand we got a thousand we have to athousand so any of you that said theythought they were less than a thousandinside of this shoe you were way offbecause there's way more than a thousandin here so now we are going to verydelicately take all of them in here andput them into here is that a dumb ideaprobably probably because we don't wantto spill them if we spill them that'svery sad let's do thiswhy did I just dump a hundred of theminto a fresh bag I could've just startedwith a hundred and just gone with it I'mnot smart sometimes okay one bag let'sput all the bags there so I'll probablylose track of how many bags yeah okayhere's that 200 onesall right 200 there's a jackhammeroutside this is what is this New YorkCityneighbors are digging a pool next doorit's crazy loud all right here's the 300going in there close all right there's300but I don't get as if in jackhammeringfor like a month nowlike how much jackhammering do you doall right here's 400 okay 400five hundredbut the six hundred and a come on comeon don't fall out guysnicely fall into the back so you got doguys okaysix hundred yes there's a seven hundredjust so tedious but I think this is theway to do it we got to be accurate hereI know we're know like Arnstein youngaccounting firm here but this is uh I dohave an accounting degree so maybe thathelps me count little balls all thoseyears of college for this kidsokay alright three more bags three morebags and we got one bag of a thousand Ithink that's a good it's a goodmilestone makes me think there'sprobably like four or five thousand inthereso hot in here so hot in here I don'treally think I think she when I saidturn down the air I think she meant shethought that I meant make it hot but Ireally meant make it cold turn down theair okayI'll say you hunter in there let's getnine hundred come on nine hundred let'sdo it get in there get in the back getin there little guys okay and then thelast one can't believe we're making awhole video about this wonder what thewatch time is gonna be on this like howmany of you are actually watchingcertain parts of this because I wouldimagine a lot of you guys are justjumping around just to figure out whatit is and find some fun moments if youare watching right now go ahead andcomment down below and tell me what timeit ishow long this videos been so I don'tknow yet but I do know now howeverwhenever it started to this point thisis one thousand one thousand is insideof there a lot more is inside of here I[Applause]can't believe that's a thousand okaywe've

like a low drawerand Leslie left the droping this muchand so I looked over and the dog hadwalked over and stuck its nose in thedoor looking at me from this angle juststaring at me with its face inside ofthe drawer like can you please give mesome bones yeah that's funny 5000 guysWow okay let's get them all in the bag5000 Leslie's over at the house to makeher first ever video all by yourself forthe

there300 what would have been an easier wayto do this like what could I have done Ihave like created a system for it to bemeasured weight or something it's gottabe some other way I mean I could havehad more people helping me I would havebeen an easy one but I figured I mightas well do it while the kids are atschool no way you can tell them andsurprise them but yeah I don't know whatwould have been a better way okaygetting there last guy there we go onetwo three four so that's five hundred inthereget in there little guy there you go 600700eight-hundred wonder what nike thinks ofthis they're watching it the nikeemployees design this shoe are probablywatching this like look at this guy hecounted out every single one of thesebeads and the guy that is in charge ofhow many are supposed to go in here he'sprobably like oh no they're supposed tobe this many exactly and now they'retesting it out to see how many thereactually are to be like one of thosethings like when you're a subway or likea restaurant and they put these or pizzaplaces like Pizza Hut Little Caesarswhere they put the exact amount ofpepperonis and everything on there tosave costs would imagine with theseNikes they don't just like fill it fullprobably like have a certain numberthat's like this is the number we'resupposed to have in it try to get tothis much so we don't use too many andcost more

you're watching this ifyou are somebody that lives outside theUnited States and maybe you wanted tolearn your numbers this was a good wayto learn your numbers today what's gonnabe funny is I'm gonna go and do closedcaptions for this it'll probably costlike it's usually like a dollar a minuteto pay for closed captions to be donethis thing's gonna be like a couplehundred bucks a few hundred bucks justfor the closed captions to be done onthis and it's just gonna be some persongoing through the entire video addingthe numbers looks almost as painful aslike actually counting them that's funnystill beautiful day out there nice andsunny nice September day SeptemberOctober whenever you see this I'llprobably be in September or maybe eventhe 1st of October we were actuallygoing to post a video to the mainchannel today the weighted blanket videoit's probably out by now and we itwasn't that it wasn't finished thismorning it's probably done like rightwhen I started this and I could havejust gone and got it out of my email anduploaded that bad boy but I've beendoing this and now we are missing ourupload window but we got to know theanswer to this will this video get anyviews probably not probably not which iskind of crazy that I would be doing thisand spending an entire day what is myvalue per hour rate to be doing thislet's say my rate is like a thousandballs an hour okay here we gonice come on there we go a couple morebut yeah what videos you guys want tosee before the end of the year whatwhat's inside videos do you want to seewhat things should we take open orshould we keep making tons of videos onour family channel it's a weird timewhere Family Channel is actually doingsome respects better than the mainchannel we've got the main channel for areally long timeso sometimes it makes me think wellmaybe we just take a pause from the mainchannel and just keep working on thefamily stuff you guys seem to reallylike that stuff and then wheneversomething super interesting like thisNike shoe comes out then of course wecould do some video on that the weightedblankets crazy interesting I don't knowif as many people watch it but it'scrazy cool interesting and then here wego 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 thousand so far we'reinside of just one of these little shoesthat's crazythat is crazy ok so we got to get onemore baggie out let's count them up makesure we've got 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

hi this is tim from fit at midlife.comand todaywe're going to compare the nike metcon 6with the reebok nano x or nano 10in great detail these are the two newestfunctional fitness stylecross trainer shoes for the year 2020.how do they stack up after a coupleweeks of testingthat's what we're going to talk about sostick aroundall right so let's dive in let's take alook at these two shoes umso first of all this is a in-depthcomparison side by side of the twowith all my thoughts on my testing sofar so if you've already watched themetcon 6 video if you've already watchedthe nanox video you know there's going to be alot of repetition here but the idea ismaybe you've narrowed down your searchto one of these two shoesyou want to see it in depth up closebecause quite frankly it's hard to go toa store and find somewhere where youcould actually try both of these onright that's uh notalways easy to do so anyways that's thepurposeof what we're going to do here so uhwith that caveat out of the waylet's compare side by side let's startwith the outsole uh if for no otherreason thenyou know let's start from the bottom theboth haveall rubber outsole very flatyou can see that there is kind of someflex grooves donein different ways on both shoes but uhboth are you know i call this like anindoorgym tread pattern it is not like meantfor trail running or in the mud oranything like that maximum contact areaand uh very uh very grippy right becauseyou don't want your feet slip slidingaroundwhen you're lifting weights when you'redoing box jumps jumping rope all thatkind of stuffsome obvious differences though so youcan see the flex grooveson the metcon 6 up in the front thereum and you've got they do it thingsdifferently on the uhon the nano there's the meta split thatgo uhyou know along the length of the shoebut there's obviously this waffle likepatternacross the rest of the outsole biggestdifferenceyou'll notice there's this big splithere and there's kind of this disconnectuh in the back this is what reebok callsa decoupled outsole so the ideabeing that uh as you heel strike whenyou're running with the shoe the splitthere and herehelps reduce some of the shock thatotherwise would travel to the rest ofthe footso decoupled outsole i believe they'realso claiming here with the nano 10 ornanox that it is a decoupled midsole as welland uh i i can't i can't tell you ifthat's the case because the midsole ison the inside i can't see iti can tell you can't really feel anyparticular difference from last year'sshoe so if there is a decoupledmidsole new for this year it does notmake any sort of difference in the waythis shoe feels in my opinion uh lookingat the metcon 6 what's interesting herewellyou know this is a wide diamond shapedheelthat is a feature that you know they'vecarried forward from the metcon 5 wasbasically the same thingtread pattern by the way exactly thesame as the metcon 5.one of the hallmarks of the sole of themetcon line though is they use twodifferent kinds of rubberso rs00 one rubber in the back zero zerofour sticky rubber up frontand more firm and durableand uh better stability forweightlifting in the heelbut stickier rubber up front for bettertraction better gripand with this pair of shoes i actuallythink this is the first time you can seethe difference between the rubberbecause when these came out of the boxthe whole thing was the same coloryou can see up front though clearly thefront part has picked up more grit andgrime and sand and dirtit and and gotten stuck in the rubberit's it's noticeably darkerso i feel like for the first time everi've got visual confirmationthat the front the rubber in theforefoot is indeeda different rubber compound not that ididn't believe nike but uhseems like there is proof there now uhother things on the outsole massive ropewrap right it's got apattern on it great for grip great forrope climbingmassive on both sides on the uh nanoyou've got uhrope pro returns rope pro right so therubber outsole wraps up a little bitaround the uharound the upper got this really supertough rubber protection wrap as wellthis keeps the rope frictionoff of the more delicate upper and uhditto on this side rightvery uh very strong very tough so howabout heel widthyou know we like to say the uh the sixhas a nice widesupportive stable heel but uh you knowthe nano's no slouch either i mean lookat that it's it'sit call it it looks the same to melike like spot on the same so both areumwide and supportiveboth have laces i love me some lacesi don't like the laceless quick lacingsystem they did on the nike react metconlaces work right you can tie them astight or as ornot as tight as you like the sixsees the return of flywire these littlevectran filaments wrap around the baseofthe laces but you can see here theyactually run all the way through thebody of the shoehelps tighten things up keeps thingsreally secure soit's cool i like it it's lightweightdoesn't add a whole lotthere's nothing wrong with what the nanohas donewith their lacing system though sothey've got laces you tighten the lacesnothing magical in particular happeninginsideand it it works it feels plenty tightuh one thing you'll see in thecomparison clip later onthis uh the upper on the nano is is muchmore stretchy and flexible and thetongueis flexing stretchable too so that isnewfor uh this year the nano last year didnot have thatit's very comfortable it feels good ilike that i can wiggle my toes aroundsome people have commented feels likethe shoe is not as stable because ofthatme personally i cannot say that i'veexperienced thatthe upper on the six isdifferent than what they used last yearvery large perforations you can see myfingers there the holes are giganticrightgot to be better ventilation andit's still very thick so you see thethickness of the material this is stillvery tough this isn't likemesh that's going to get ripped up andand fail quickly i think it's going tobe a very durable shoeyou can see along the front there's anextra layer of material eventougher along the inside of the toe allthe high wear areastongue is not it looks consistencyit's got the same pattern it is notsee-through breathable though and uhthe tongue on the nano is beefier it'sgot kind of theseside pieces the only complaint i haveabout the nanox is uh as far as the tongueif you if you see where the bolsters endlike if i tighten this too much thatpart you can really feel that digginginto your instepuh or that top of your foot i thinkthat's what that's called so you have tobe careful about how you tie themwould be better if this part this littlecushion pad should have ranfurther down uh down further where thelaces areand maybe it's just how it fits me uhand it's a minor thing becauseit always tells me hey you havetightened the laces too much so loosenthem up a little bitlooking at the heels and the collarsyou can see that uh you know this is amuch bigger taller collararea right it's got this achilles padback here it's comfortable that's a nicematerialthe tongue comes up higher and thisoverall fits uh feels more streamlinedto be honest on the six it feels likeyou're wearing less shoeuh feels like you're wearing more shoebecause it's taller there's more to itsurprisingly these shoes weigh almostexactly the same thingso 14.1 ounces for the six14.3 ounces for the nano xso despite the fact that it looks likeit's got a lot more to it it's actuallynot that much heaviernow with the six i'm not really surewhere the extra weight came from overlast year's shoe so that isthat is uh that is uh six tenths of anounceor so heavier than the metcon 5 notreally sure where the weight is comingfrombecause this thing is so similar to themetcon 5. the nano x it's not a mysteryit's heavier than the nano9 was as well there's more to it rightyou add more of course it's going toweigh more so it makes total sense therebutboth are in the low 14 ounce rangeuh that's not necessarily a horriblething but that's not really a trend wewant to see continue indefinitely eitherif you think back then the metcon 4 waslike in the middle 11 ounce rangeso these things have really gottenheaviersince then and that is a that is amountof weightyou can feel the difference if you'rewearing two different shoes and one is14 ounces and one is 11. you canimmediately tell the differencebetween the two shoes other things herefour foot flexibility side by side uhthe um the nano here is feeling stifferit's a little taking a little more forcefor me to flex thingsbut you know at the end of the daythat's not a huge deal when you're uhjumping rope or you know boundingleaping sprinting whatever you're doingit's it's plenty fine this is definitelymore flexible thoughuh maybe because of the flex groovesand uh those flex grooves and continuingthem in themidsole as well uh the other thing withthesewhat's the heel to toe drop everybodyalways wants to know thatand the answer is i think both are stillfour millimeter heel to toe drop i thinkthey're four millimeterbecause the nano nine was fourmillimeters the metcon5 was four millimeters and reallyboth shoes feel and they have taken alot of the components from last year'sshoe and just carried it forwardthey have not published a number foreither i have not seen a publishednumber for the reebok i've not seen onefor the metconi think they're the same they feel thesame to mebut uh it's not something i cannecessarily measure directly so i'mgonna say they're both four millimeterand uh being cross trainers right thatis what they call relativelylow profile not a big heel raise like arunning shoe or a lifterit's a little flatter makes it moreversatile and you can do more things inthe shoe that's just kind of across trainer kind of thing of coursethe big difference between these twoshoesfour millimeters if that isn't enoughheel raise for youin the metcon 6 we have the hyperliftsbackagain so this was a feature they addedwith the metcon 5.little very stiff firmplastic material you drop this insideunder the removable or the drop inmidsole and it adds eight millimeters ofadditional heel to toe dropso you take the four millimeters of heelto toe drop that's already in thereyou add the eight millimeters and thenyou get 12 millimeters of heel to toedropin the metcon so why would you even wantheel raise wellthrusters squats olympic liftinguh you know anything really where you'regetting down and you got a squat deeperreduces the amount of ankle flexibilitythat you need and that kind of stuff andyou might say well just develop yourselfsome better ankle flexibility but thehonestuh my thought on it is there there arelimitations in how much ankleflexibility you can develop there uhthere is a there is a limit i believe sosomething like this helpswhen you want the heel raise cool thingabout these is you can pop them out whenyou don't want ituh or put them in when you do want itjust uh don't lose them keep themsomewhereyou won't forget where they are uh theonly other complaint i have about theseis because this is a relatively lowcollarwhen i put the eight millimeterhyperlift in my foot sits so much higherin here it starts to feel uncomfortableit feels like there's not enough collaron the shoethe nano does not have any sort of dropin hyperliftbut that collar so high if it did itwould it wouldfit me uh would feel more comfortable itwould feel betteri effectively get what i would call heelslip when i put the hyperlifts ini feel like i get heel slippage becauseit's it's the shape of my heelit's up too high in the shoe and thecollar is just too low not everybodycomplains about that though some peoplesay i'm crazyand uh that's fine because the the factof the matter is everybody's footis different different width your heelmay be larger or smalleror it may go up more or less all thesekind of differences and that's why i'malways hesitantto give a whole lot of sizing advice butyou know you really just have to trythese and they don't work for you sendthem backtry something else that's the the bestadvice i can give you thereso we talked about the um dropand the hyper lifts how about noise uhare thesenoisy the uh the nano or the metcon 6.wellif you remember a few years back therewas the whole thing with the metconsqueakthe metcon 4 the metcon 3 the metcon 4xdwere all very squeaky shoes because thatremovable that drop in midsole would rubagainst the interior of the shoe and itwould make like a squeaking scrunchingnoiseevery time you uh you walked or took astep and i hadat least five pairs between the metcon 3metcon 4 metcon 4xd i had at least fiveor six pairsthey all squeaked they fixed it with thefive the five did not have the metconsqueakhappy to say the six does not have themetcon squeakbut it does have a loud noisy heel sothe heel on this uh it's rubber you cansee me compressing itbut it's something i think it's thispart is so solidlike when you're walking these clip-cloplike a pair of liftersand they're just very noisy shoes whenyou're walking on a hard surface likeconcrete like asphalt like a woodenfloor like a tile flooryou're walking in the grass you won'tnotice but they make a noticeable clipclop clip clopand some people don't like that uh it'snot the end of the world it doesn'tbother meand uh i think it's acceptable for whatit is for being a firm heelthe nano on the other hand though youreally don't get that clip-flopsensation because this isthis is not as solid and and this isvery flexible this is not a solidyou get a tiny amount of clip clop ifyou're on like a wood floor or somethinglike thati'll put a clip in there i'll walk onasphalt with the two shoes i'll show youyou'll easily be able to hear theclip-clop of the heelof the six you will not hear it for thenano thoughother than that both are very quiet andgood shoesgood grip and they are not overlysqueaky when they get wet either so thatis a good thing as wellall right so let's talk fit and sizingand cushioning and all that kind ofstuff so i'm going to do this a littlebit differently hereuh actually show you on foot and talkthrough ituh not sure if this will work out we'llgive it a shotat any rate i'm sure we will hear lotsof commentsabout my hairy legs so let's dive rightinto itmetcon 6 on the right of course andnano on the left this is a great way tofeel the difference it looks silly butit's a great way to just tellwhat are the differences between the twoshoes so i love to do thisand i will work out i willgo outside in public this way sometimesnot really uh somewhere where too manypeople can see mebut uh look at the width i mean that'sthe first thing i think is obvious anduh hopefully the cameraangle is gathering that but uh nice andwidefeels like there's more usable widthright up here in the toe boxon the nano uh gone a half size up onthe metcon 6 so it'sit's adequate and there's a little bitof room to spare so it's nice andcomfortable feels greatif i wear these all day your feet swelluh when you're on your feet all day andthat kind of stuff so you want to have alittle bit of roomwhen i go in 11 in the metcon linewhether it be the five of the six it'sjust a little bit too tightand uh you know i have to go half sizeupno problems if i do this though uh bothfeel pretty goodand uh you know check out the uh theflexibility on theuh forefoot of the nano very comfortablevery stretchyand i think it looks good it lookssophisticated to me so the newflex weave or whatever they're callingit it is stretchy got a great pattern onit looks goodtongue is stretchy nice and comfortablebut this upper is cool too coolliterally right because thoseperforations are so big you can seethrough themcan't see necessarily here because i'vegot on dark colored socks but you wouldbe able to see your socks through thereif i had white socks on it's got to bemore breathableright it's just it's ventilation holeswhere the air can help move through soit has to be more breathablecan't really say that i felt thedifference though to be honest i've donea lot of hot and sweatyworkouts here august florida i work outin the garage or outside no airconditioningshould theoretically make a differencebut it's it's not necessarily somethingyou can feelin my opinion so what about cushioninglet's talk forefoot first the uhthe metcon feels like it has slightlymore cushion in the forefoot thanks tothat dual density midsolethat we'll show you here in a little bitnano hasless it feels to me it definitely feelslikeless cushion so as i'm pushing down ican kind of feel thecompression of my foot into the cushionslightly more in the forefooton the six heels are about the same tobe honestthere's a tiny amount of cushion tinytiny amount of cushionbut these are not lifters right the heelis not completely solidthere is some cushion but again shiftingmy weight kind of feelingmy foot compress into the cushion theheels feel spot on the same to methat is subjective i don't have a way tomeasure that officiallybut both have a very stable very solidheelwith the tiniest little bit of cushionand that of course is what makes you sogreat for lifting weightsand it doesn't matter if you're doing uhbodybuilding power liftingor crossfit functional fitness styleweightlifting right with some olympiclifts and all kinds of stuff mixed inthey're just great because of that heelvery stable looking from the backi think you can see the width both shoesthey've got the diamond shaped heelon the six but you also have a nice veryvery nice wide heelon the nano as well four footflexibilityboth are great and there's nothingreally to complain aboutthe uh all rubber outsolesgreat grip um great tractionvery flat a lot of contact area on bothand uhoverall these are not bad shoesuh just remember you know you're gonnahave the properexpectations around the cushioning inthe shoeall right so let's talk in the gym uhhow do these work what can i do withthese are theyreally cross trainers are they good forrunning all that stuff that you want toknow socats out of the bag these are awesomeweightlifting shoes sowhether you're powerlifting bodybuildbodybuilding crossfitfunctional fitness olympic lifting uhboth are excellent weightlifting shoeswhysuper solid stable heel uh they don'thave a ton of heel raise we talked aboutthatbut uh you know you can you can do quitewell regardless of course you can dropthe hyperlift inon the six but both are excellent forweightlifting andthat was actually why i originally gotinto all these shoes i was like heyi'm tired of lifting in my running shoesbecause it sucksand that's what led me to cross trainersso very good therehow about running so reebok says thenano x the nano 10 isrunnable they've made up a word uhand the metcon 6 of course you'resupposed to be able to runthis as well well you can of course youcan run in them right because they'vegot flexibility they've got some cushionbut honestly the heels are so solid andstable and just not very cushionedyour heel striking you when you'resprinting for me it's not so bad wheni'm sprinting i'm running fast i'm up onmy toesthere's that little bit of cushion andthat kind of helps absorb the shockbut i'll be honest when i'm heelstriking in both shoes those very solidstable heelseven in the decoupled outsole andmidsole of the nano x like all thatshock goes right up into my knees and myhipand uh i'm an old guy if i haven'tmentioned that yet in this clip i'm 47i'm 195 poundswhen i run on asphalt i can't really doit in cross trainersit's just too much shock too much impactso uhfor running workouts i recommend runningshoes with cushionthese will do in a pinch short runs youknow i don't expect you to weari know i certainly wouldn't wear twodifferent pairs of shoes for the samewad or anything like thatuh they'll get the job done but i thinkthese are better for weight liftingand other stuff jumping rope box jumpsstuff like thatneither makes a fantastic running shoein my opinionhow about rope climbs i don't know idon't have a rope to climbuh just looking at it it feels like thiscan't be beat this gigantic rope wrap onthis thing i mean this has to be astellar rope climbing shoeyou've got the rope pro here i'll betyou this works fine as wellbut unfortunately i cannot give you aneducated opinionon how these perform for rope climbinglater this year i may add a rope thoughto my homegym setup and try to actually do somesort of comparison thereall right so there you go that was nikemetcon 6 versus reebok nano x nano 10.what is the verdict well to be honestthis lineup this matchup doesn't feel all that different frommetcon 5 versus nano 9.they've carried for forward a lot of thesame featuresfrom last year's shoes both in the nikeand the reebokand the strengths to me pretty much feelthe samei like the new upper on the six i likethe breathability i like the toughnessbut i also like the new stretchycomfortable upperon the reebok nano x it is a very nicegood improvement over what they had lastyear both have gained weightbut the nano feels bulkier because it'sgot more up around your heelincluding the cushion here in the callin the collarso if you want a more streamlinedminimized feel you might want to go themetcon 6 even though both weighnearly the same thing in my opinionthe fact that the metcon 6 has slightlymore cushion in the forefootand includes those hyper lifts for extraheel raisei feel like it is still the moreversatile shoe and it has an advantagefor functional fitness and crossfitstyle workoutshaving said that you can't go wrong witheither in my opinion they areboth excellent because they have beeniterated on over and over and over formany yearsso that's our review if you found thisuseful please likeplease

me hey you havetightened the laces too much so loosenthem up a little bitlooking at the heels and the collarsyou can see that uh you know this is amuch bigger taller collararea right it's got this achilles padback here it's comfortable that's a nicematerialthe tongue comes up higher and thisoverall fits uh feels more streamlinedto be honest on the six it feels likeyou're wearing less shoeuh feels like you're wearing more shoebecause it's taller there's more to itsurprisingly these shoes weigh almostexactly the same thingso 14.1 ounces for the six14.3 ounces for the nano xso despite the fact that it looks likeit's got a lot more to it it's actuallynot that much heaviernow with the six i'm not really surewhere the extra weight came from overlast year's shoe so that isthat is uh that is uh six tenths of anounceor so heavier than the metcon 5 notreally sure where the weight is comingfrombecause this thing is so similar to themetcon 5. the nano x it's not a mysteryit's heavier than the nano9 was as well there's more to it rightyou add more of course it's going toweigh more so it makes total sense therebutboth are in the low 14 ounce rangeuh that's not necessarily a horriblething but that's not really a trend wewant to see continue indefinitely eitherif you think back then the metcon 4 waslike in the middle 11 ounce rangeso these things have really gottenheaviersince then and that is a that is amountof weightyou can feel the difference if you'rewearing two different shoes and one is14 ounces and one is 11. you canimmediately tell the differencebetween the two shoes other things herefour foot flexibility side by side uhthe um the nano here is feeling stifferit's a little taking a little more forcefor me to flex thingsbut you know at the end of the daythat's not a huge deal when you're uhjumping rope or you know boundingleaping sprinting whatever you're doingit's it's plenty fine this is definitelymore flexible thoughuh maybe because of the flex groovesand uh those flex grooves and continuingthem in themidsole as well uh the other thing withthesewhat's the heel to toe drop everybodyalways wants to know thatand the answer is i think both are stillfour millimeter heel to toe drop i thinkthey're four millimeterbecause the nano nine was fourmillimeters the metcon5 was four millimeters and reallyboth shoes feel and they have taken alot of the components from last year'sshoe and just carried it forwardthey have not published a number foreither i have not seen a publishednumber for the reebok i've not seen onefor the metconi think they're the same they feel thesame to mebut uh it's not something i cannecessarily measure directly so i'mgonna say they're both four millimeterand uh being cross trainers right thatis what they call relativelylow profile not a big heel raise like arunning shoe or a lifterit's a little flatter makes it moreversatile and you can do more things inthe shoe that's just kind of across trainer kind of thing of coursethe big difference between these twoshoesfour millimeters if that isn't enoughheel raise for youin the metcon 6 we have the hyperliftsbackagain so this was a feature they addedwith the metcon 5.little very stiff firmplastic material you drop this insideunder the removable or the drop inmidsole and it adds eight millimeters ofadditional heel to toe dropso you take the four millimeters of heelto toe drop that's already in thereyou add the eight millimeters and thenyou get 12 millimeters of heel to toedropin the metcon so why would you even wantheel raise wellthrusters squats olympic liftinguh you know anything really where you'regetting down and you got a squat deeperreduces the amount of ankle flexibilitythat you need and that kind of stuff andyou might say well just develop yourselfsome better ankle flexibility but thehonestuh my thought on it is there there arelimitations in how much ankleflexibility you can develop there uhthere is a there is a limit i believe sosomething like this helpswhen you want the heel raise cool thingabout these is you can pop them out whenyou don't want ituh or put them in when you do want itjust uh don't lose them keep themsomewhereyou won't forget where they are uh theonly other complaint i have about theseis because this is a relatively lowcollarwhen i put the eight millimeterhyperlift in my foot sits so much higherin here it starts to feel uncomfortableit feels like there's not enough collaron the shoethe nano does not have any sort of dropin hyperliftbut that collar so high if it did itwould it wouldfit me uh would feel more comfortable itwould feel betteri effectively get what i would call heelslip when i put the hyperlifts ini feel like i get heel slippage becauseit's it's the shape of my heelit's up too high in the shoe and thecollar is just too low not everybodycomplains about that though some peoplesay i'm crazyand uh that's fine because the the factof the matter is everybody's footis different different width your heelmay be larger or smalleror it may go up more or less all thesekind of differences and that's why i'malways hesitantto give a whole lot of sizing advice butyou know you really just have to trythese and they don't work for you sendthem backtry something else that's the the bestadvice i can give you thereso we talked about the um dropand the hyper lifts how about noise uhare thesenoisy the uh the nano or the metcon 6.wellif you remember a few years back therewas the whole thing with the metconsqueakthe metcon 4 the metcon 3 the metcon 4xdwere all very squeaky shoes because thatremovable that drop in midsole would rubagainst the interior of the shoe and itwould make like a squeaking scrunchingnoiseevery time you uh you walked or took astep and i hadat least five pairs between the metcon 3metcon 4 metcon 4xd i had at least fiveor six pairsthey all squeaked they fixed it with thefive the five did not have the metconsqueakhappy to say the six does not have themetcon squeakbut it does have a loud noisy heel sothe heel on this uh it's rubber you cansee me compressing itbut it's something i think it's thispart is so solidlike when you're walking these clip-cloplike a pair of liftersand they're just very noisy shoes whenyou're walking on a hard surface likeconcrete like asphalt like a woodenfloor like a tile flooryou're walking in the grass you won'tnotice but they make a noticeable clipclop clip clopand some people don't like that uh it'snot the end of the world it doesn'tbother meand uh i think it's acceptable for whatit is for being a firm heelthe nano on the other hand though youreally don't get that clip-flopsensation because this isthis is not as solid and and this isvery flexible this is not a solidyou get a tiny amount of clip clop ifyou're on like a wood floor or somethinglike thati'll put a clip in there i'll walk onasphalt with the two shoes i'll show youyou'll easily be able to hear theclip-clop of the heelof the six you will not hear it for thenano thoughother than that both are very quiet andgood shoesgood grip and they are not overlysqueaky when they get wet either so thatis a good thing as wellall right so let's talk fit and sizingand cushioning and all that kind ofstuff so i'm going to do this a littlebit differently hereuh actually show you on foot and talkthrough ituh not sure if this will work out we'llgive it a shotat any rate i'm sure we will hear lotsof commentsabout my hairy legs so let's dive rightinto itmetcon 6 on the right of course andnano on the left this is a great way tofeel the difference it looks silly butit's a great way to just tellwhat are the differences between the twoshoes so i love to do thisand i will work out i willgo outside in public this way sometimesnot really uh somewhere where too manypeople can see mebut uh look at the width i mean that'sthe first thing i think is obvious anduh hopefully the cameraangle is gathering that but uh nice andwidefeels like there's more usable widthright up here in the toe boxon the nano uh gone a half size up onthe metcon 6 so it'sit's adequate and there's a little bitof room to spare so it's nice andcomfortable feels greatif i wear these all day your feet swelluh when you're on your feet all day andthat kind of stuff so you want to have alittle bit of roomwhen i go in 11 in the metcon linewhether it be the five of the six it'sjust a little bit too tightand uh you know i have to go half sizeupno problems if i do this though uh bothfeel pretty goodand uh you know check out the uh theflexibility on theuh forefoot of the nano very comfortablevery stretchyand i think it looks good it lookssophisticated to me so the newflex weave or whatever they're callingit it is stretchy got a great pattern onit looks goodtongue is stretchy nice and comfortablebut this upper is cool too coolliterally right because thoseperforations are so big you can seethrough themcan't see necessarily here because i'vegot on dark colored socks but you wouldbe able to see your socks through thereif i had white socks on it's got to bemore breathableright it's just it's ventilation holeswhere the air can help move through soit has to be more breathablecan't really say that i felt thedifference though to be honest i've donea lot of hot and sweatyworkouts here august florida i work outin the garage or outside no airconditioningshould theoretically make a differencebut it's it's not necessarily somethingyou can feelin my opinion so what about cushioninglet's talk forefoot first the uhthe metcon feels like it has slightlymore cushion in the forefoot thanks tothat dual density midsolethat we'll show you here in a little bitnano hasless it feels to me it definitely feelslikeless cushion so as i'm pushing down ican kind of feel thecompression of my foot into the cushionslightly more in the forefooton the six heels are about the same tobe honestthere's a tiny amount of cushion tinytiny amount of cushionbut these are not lifters right the heelis not completely solidthere is some cushion but again shiftingmy weight kind of feelingmy foot compress into the cushion theheels feel spot on the same to methat is subjective i don't have a way tomeasure that officiallybut both have a very stable very solidheelwith the tiniest little bit of cushionand that of course is what makes you sogreat for lifting weightsand it doesn't matter if you're doing uhbodybuilding power liftingor crossfit functional fitness styleweightlifting right with some olympiclifts and all kinds of stuff mixed inthey're just great because of that heelvery stable looking from the backi think you can see the width both shoesthey've got the diamond shaped heelon the six but you also have a nice veryvery nice wide heelon the nano as well four footflexibilityboth are great and there's nothingreally to complain aboutthe uh all rubber outsolesgreat grip um great tractionvery flat a lot of contact area on bothand uhoverall these are not bad shoesuh just remember you know you're gonnahave the properexpectations around the cushioning inthe shoeall right so let's talk in the gym uhhow do these work what can i do withthese are theyreally cross trainers are they good forrunning all that stuff that you want toknow socats out of the bag these are awesomeweightlifting shoes sowhether you're powerlifting bodybuildbodybuilding crossfitfunctional fitness olympic lifting uhboth are excellent weightlifting shoeswhysuper solid stable heel uh they don'thave a ton of heel raise we talked aboutthatbut uh you know you can you can do quitewell regardless of course you can dropthe hyperlift inon the six but both are excellent forweightlifting andthat was actually why i originally gotinto all these shoes i was like heyi'm tired of lifting in my running shoesbecause it sucksand that's what led me to cross trainersso very good therehow about running so reebok says thenano x the nano 10 isrunnable they've made up a word uhand the metcon 6 of course you'resupposed to be able to runthis as well well you can of course youcan run in them right because they'vegot flexibility they've got some cushionbut honestly the heels are so solid andstable and just not very cushionedyour heel striking you when you'resprinting for me it's not so bad wheni'm sprinting i'm running fast i'm up onmy toesthere's that little bit of cushion andthat kind of helps absorb the shockbut i'll be honest when i'm heelstriking in both shoes those very solidstable heelseven in the decoupled outsole andmidsole of the nano x like all thatshock goes right up into my knees and myhipand uh i'm an old guy if i haven'tmentioned that yet in this clip i'm 47i'm 195 poundswhen i run on asphalt i can't really doit in cross trainersit's just too much shock too much impactso uhfor running workouts i recommend runningshoes with cushionthese will do in a pinch short runs youknow i don't expect you to weari know i certainly wouldn't wear twodifferent pairs of shoes for the samewad or anything like thatuh they'll get the job done but i thinkthese are better for weight liftingand other stuff jumping rope box jumpsstuff like thatneither makes a fantastic running shoein my opinionhow about rope climbs i don't know idon't have a rope to climbuh just looking at it it feels like thiscan't be beat this gigantic rope wrap onthis thing i mean this has to be astellar rope climbing shoeyou've got the rope pro here i'll betyou this works fine as wellbut unfortunately i cannot give you aneducated opinionon how these perform for rope climbinglater this year i may add a rope thoughto my homegym setup and try to actually do somesort of comparison thereall right so there you go that was nikemetcon 6 versus reebok nano x nano 10.what is the verdict well to be honestthis lineup this matchup doesn't feel all that different frommetcon 5 versus nano 9.they've carried for forward a lot of thesame featuresfrom last year's shoes both in the nikeand the reebokand the strengths to me pretty much feelthe samei like the new upper on the six i likethe breathability i like the toughnessbut i also like the new stretchycomfortable upperon the reebok nano x it is a very nicegood improvement over what they had lastyear both have gained weightbut the nano feels bulkier because it'sgot more up around your heelincluding the cushion here in the callin the collarso if you want a more streamlinedminimized feel you might want to go themetcon 6 even though both weighnearly the same thing in my opinionthe fact that the metcon 6 has slightlymore cushion in the forefootand includes those hyper lifts for extraheel raisei feel like it is still the moreversatile shoe and it has an advantagefor functional fitness and crossfitstyle workoutshaving said that you can't go wrong witheither in my opinion they areboth excellent because they have beeniterated on over and over and over formany yearsso that's our review if you found thisuseful please likeplease

[Music]so in today's video i'm going to bemakinggraphic designs better with some smallminor changes and we are going to belooking at nikefedex microsoft and ibm in today's videoit's really great being able to show howa design looks but it's even moreimpressive if they can actuallyexperience the design itself as well asunderstand how it feels and how itbehaveslearn more about framer later in today'svideoso here is our first design which is akind of an old-schoolnike design a blast from the past so tospeakin today's video i'm making the leastamount of changes possiblejust to show how effective they can bebut what would you do to this design andhow would you change it tomaybe solve a problem or just to make itmore effective as a graphic designnow you might be thinking well thetypography needs changingbut how would you change the typographyand what style would you go withyou might be thinking that oh tom's justgonna slap on a sans-serif fontwell in this instance you'd be wrong inthinking that because i've gone aheadand used a slab serif typefaceinstead of a sans serif so what is mylogic here and how does this actuallyworkwell we can see that the design is moretraditional and it's more old schooland so the designer here has used aserif fontnow i've decided to keep things moretraditional more retrobut i've gone with a slab serif as ithink it does keep inwith the older style but it's kind ofmore trendy and more sportyespecially with the italics going onhere if we can noticethe lines of the model we have somemovementmoving across from left to right andthat's backed upwith the nike logo right hereso that's why i chose italics and notjust a static straightup kind of typeface for my design alsowe have some hierarchy in size and alsothicknesswhich i do think works well and betterthan this heresecond up today we have fedex which isusuallyreally great when it comes to brandingand just getting themselves out there ina graphic designway there are a few things niggling atme when i look at this design and i'msuremany of you can see what they are aswell and if many people can see them andrecognize them then that means there isa common problem that iswidely accepted by people who do viewthis designand before we go on i do understand thata lot of the time when designers workon a branding project they'll be given acolor scheme a set of fonts to useand they cannot stray away from that iunderstand that and i've had thathappen to myself many times but for thepurposes of this video just showing whatworks what does not worki'm not going to limit myself to onespecific font or whateverwe're just demonstrating how a designcan look better and how it can be moreefficient to the end userso the first problem with this designwas the orangetext below the main line of text andthis was very difficult to read on ablue backgroundyes it stands out but it's almostillegible because the colors are tooclashy it doesn't work well togetherit's almost you know it always hurts theeyes to look atand so i did end up going with a morekind of darker color that i sampled fromthe mountains behindand also the fonts that's used on thescore it with was very very crudeand i really didn't like this font soi've gone with a more standardeasier to read and more approachablesans-serif fontalso lastly notice how there's movementgoing up this way and out if we have thetext aligned to the rightthe movement is kind of suggestivecoming this waywhich i feel doesn't work and it's oneof thosesubtle changes but in the end i think itmakes a big impactas you can see i've aligned things tothe left and we continuethat movement that's starting here ohyeah andfor those of you have got really goodeyes out there i missed out thethe website down here by accident ofcourseand next up we have microsoft whichagain are usuallyfairly good when it comes to brandingbut this design is in particulari have a few issues with some things totake note of are that microsofthave usually been going with this squarekind of layout on a lot of theirbranding and also of course their logobut what would you change about thisdesign and what doesn't work when you'reglancing at itas a graphic designer well i've madequite a few changes but for methe main issue was that we have one twothree four five six main text areasi understand the design is broken upinto these squares and sectionswhen you're trying to extractinformation from a design it's just toomuchi think the concept is great but i thinkit's been takentoo far if that makes sense so my designi haveone section here with these typographicareas and then down here i have thissection that leads nicely onto this oneherethis would be classified as proximityand just balancing things outalso for some contrast and just makingthings more subtlei've reduced the impactness ofthe one and also the hundred percentjust to make things a little moreaccessible and easier on the ice butyeah i just felt this one was verybusy and just kind of disjointed and iknowthat was the concept and the idea but ijust think it's been taken too farnext up we have ibm and they reallydropped the ball on this one i don'tunderstand what happened hereand as you can see i can't see and youprobably can't read either what's goingon here andyou know it just looks wrong i don'tknow how a designer could end upmaking something like this so of coursethe first thing i did was went ahead andenlarged the text and also this bit overhereone of the key and crucial aspects ofdesigning anything is making sure thetextis legible so you can deliver themessage and the informationsuccessfully i also wanted to give thisword smoother a well a smooth touch andblend into the background a little bitmorejust so it does come across as beingsmoothereven though it's not striking incontrast with color it does make itselfstand out from the rest of the textand it just adds more depth to a designyou might be thinking why not put theibm and thisslogan down in the bottom left but ifyou do that you will realize the designquickly becomes unbalanced with too muchweightgoing on on the left and absolutelynothing on the right these linesalso direct attention outwards and so itneedsto have something over here for theselines to make senseif you want to get involved and if youwant to try and do some before and afterdesign workthere is a link down below of a designeryou can work onand just send it to the email addressdown below as well i will choose threedesigns to show in a later videoprobably later this monthand so i look forward to seeing what youguys can come up

socute and even though it isdenim it kind of is stretchy enough thatit's stillreally flattering and it fits me in allthe right places but because it is denimit is a little bit thicker and i don'tknow

hi this is tim from fititmidlife.comtodayi've got the brand new nike metcon 6 thenewest metcon shoe for the year 2020.we're going to compare it side by sidewith the nike metcon 5from last year what's new what'simprovedwhat size should you get and should youeven bother upgradingthat's what we're going to talk about sostick aroundall right so here it is the nike metcon6.this is one of two uh launch colorwaysavailable for mencamouflage i think it looks sharp itlooks better than the matte fraseredition in my opinionas soon as i saw this thing it was likeyeah i got to get a pair of theseand you know it is a metcon shoe let'stake a look so you can seenice flat all rubber outsole nike swooshthere on the bottomgot the rope wrap coming up around themid footrelatively low cut collar just likeyou've come to expectand we've got regular laceswith flywire get it as tight or as looseas you likecoming around this side you can see alittle bit more there's a nice swooshtheremesh upper we're going to talk all aboutthat got a tongueit's not uh super thin not super paddedkind of middle of the road that's niceand uh overall it's a pretty goodlooking shoe nice metconm there on the heel and that's the nikemetcon 6.so now let's compare it to the nikemetcon 5.all right so let's compare with the nikemetcon5. so we've got them here side by sideso first of all you'll noticea lot of similarities right the samebasicshape and outline isobviously there a lot of similarities imeanreally what's the big difference on themetcon 6it's that mesh upper you know we'll kindof cut right to the chase hereum they've reused the outsoleuh you can see it is the sameshape and uh same let's do this viewhereyou can see that it is the uhsame in the width you've got thatdiamond shaped heel still you've gotthe flex grooves in the same kind ofpatternand you know as you might expect levelsof forefoot flexibility are the sameuh some interesting things that you cansee though on thisuh metcon 6. so one of the things theydo with this is theoutsole is actually made with twodifferent kinds of rubber so there'sfirmermore durable rubber in the heel stickierrubber with better traction up frontand i think for the first time with thiscolor scheme on this one you canactually see the difference so thisdidn't come like this right the wholething lookedlike this part but you can see as i'veworn this around a bit on the asphaltout in the dirt and the grassit's kind of picked up some of the colorso i thinkthat is uh where you see the stickierrubber in usebecause it's clearly picking up a littlemore dingy stuff on there anddiscoloringso um pretty cool that you can actuallysee that in actionbut uh you know you couldn't really tellon this metcon 5 because it's all grayand uh you know it doesn't really showup so anywaysthat's that uh the width of everythingthe dimensions are the samejust trying to eyeball it here but youcan see it's it's the same part i meanevenyou can see the flex grooves right theyall line upthe uh the rope wrap is still here uhcomes up high on both sides of the shoeand uh that tough rubber outsoleright this uh is very tough materialkeeps the friction of the rope off ofthe upperof the shoe which is more delicate andtherefore needs to be protecteduh let's see what else let's look at theheelso comparing the heels what you can seehereon the five you know we had a swoosh wehad uhkind of faux leather material i'll movein for a close-up so you can see thatand uh you know we had some randomstats printed on this thing i don't knowif you can see that there if that'sgonnapick up or not but things like the theheel to toe dropuh four millimeter offset and uh a fewother things therei always thought that was kind of oddbecause when i saw that on the initialpicturesof the shoe i was like well that lookslike testinformation or something that's notgoing to be on the final shoe is it wellyes it is it's on every uh every metcon5.so it's pretty subtle here on thiscolorway um they've done away with thatin the six they've given it a moresophisticated looking heel uh so firstof alli like i like this this dimpleduh pattern i don't know if it's dimpledbut that's what i'm gonna call it orit's like it's like a hexshape uh looks good looks sophisticatedand uh i like the big mthe big metcon m i think that looksreally sharpuh you can see shape of the collarit is the same rate i mean it comes upabout that highit's dished down uh fairly low it's alow cut shoeright it doesn't have a tonof um material in the heeland speaking of the heel though you canseethe tpu clip in the backuh it's the same same materialit is slick it istough uh and it's got kind of like thatknife edge on it i like to call it sothatyou can get minimal drag up and down thewallwhen you're doing handstand push-ups atleast i think that's the rationalebehind thatuh so that's pretty much unchanged onething you'll noticethat part of the shoe does discolorquite abit well maybe not quite a bit but atleast a little bit i don't know if youcan see that there butsome of the uh the color comes off thetpu heel clipnot a big deal because who looks at thatanyways and i mean the fact of thematter is it's a shoe you wear itand uh you know parts of it are going towear outso uh pretty much the same uh generalshape and sizeum the laces uh you know regular lacesright on both shoes you've gotflywire that's these little filamentshere that wrap around thethe base of the laces on the insidei'll show you on the six because you cansee it really well thosewrap all the way around the shoe theidea being you tighten this up it helpsmake a nice secure fit and uh you knowwe had that on the metcon 5. it's alittle harder to see on this colorwaybut there's the flywire loops and uhsame deal they run through the insideso that's still there uh the tonguethey've not really changed anything asfar as i could tellfeels about the same thickness which isgood uh the four had a paperthin tongue maybe not paper thin but apretty thintongue and so they added some paddingbut they didn't go crazy with the fiveand so they'vestuck with that with the six and that'sgoodas far as i'm concerned what do we haveon the tonguehere in the six we've got some statsuh i don't know what this is i mean thisis just obviouslyuh for aesthetics or something airflowfeet a minute uh squat i don't know someinsane number of kilograms there i'm notreally surewhere they came up with this um or ifthis is like matt fraser'stypical wad numbers or something likethati honestly have no idea uh but you cansee it says metcon 6 thereand you know overall cool hey if you'regoing to put some weird gibberish youmight as well put it somewhere nobody'sgoing to see ituh on the tongue and the 5 we had themetconhere we've got uh netcon in the swooshoverall it looks pretty good so i'vekind of been dancing around the bigdifferencebut that is the upper so let's give youan up-close lookat the upper here so you can see on thefiveit is a fairly solid umvery solid it's a dual layer materialit's got that 3d hapticprint on top to make it tough it variesindensity it's denser up front wherethere's more wearless here where you want betterbreathability but what they've done withthis shoesomething completely different so uhhopefully you can see my fingers throughthe meshi mean this is mesh this is truly meshit's so perforated youcan see through it nike claims an 18improvement in airflow i say it's got tobe way better than that because thesehuge holes here that you can see throughand i mean you can see the lightshining through into the toe areathe lights that i'm using right i meanthat's insane that's just a tonof breathability uh certainly can't doanything like that on the metcon 5.so that is the big difference it's theupper it's super breathable it'sperforatedand uh you know up up in the frontit's starting from about here uh there'san extrainterior material so you know it's notperforated fullyup here in the front uh just on the topfor the most part not on the sides noton the tongueright the tongue you clearly cannot seethrough that but hey that's pretty goodand my first concern was like if i'mwalking in wet grass dewy grass or mysocks gonna quickly and easily get wetnot really because this part is gonnatake the bruntof that kind of stuff um but you knowvery breathable and i think it uh ithink it looks goodnike says it's still tough uh you knowit doesn't i don't know if it doesn'treally have the 3d haptic print on itbut this isn't uh this isn't likeit's it's pretty thick too so i'm goingto hold it up closelike the materialit's it's quite dense it's quite thickso i think this is going to be nice anddurableuh so anyways the upper that's the bigdifference and uh you knowthe other thing is um this part is alittle bit different souh on the five right at the peak of therope wrap it kind of went off on adiagonalthe difference on the six is at the peakof the rope wrap instead of going offdiagonal it goes straight upthey've got kind of like almost a tapelooking wrap here and herethey're doing all kinds of cool thingswith different colors and stylesand you know i'll be honest that's onethe big appealat least to me of the nike metcon shoesis they come up with some really sicklooking colorcombos uh and that's how i've ended upwith more pairs of shoes than i canactually wearso uh good looking and we'll be able todo more optionswhat else the midsole the drop indual density midsole is back so dualdensityuh mushy more cushioned foam up heredenser in the heel and clearly twodifferent pieces of foam you can see theflex grooves therenike has given us some stats so thefront it says pufoam022 durometer 40cdurometer is like um you measure bounceand things like that right like whenyou're buying bumper plates you can goby the durometer just tell howhow firm or uh how bouncy they're goingto be so the front's cushionedthe back is stable pu foam zero one zerouh durometer 51. so uhyou know you might be wondering was thatexactly the sameas what was in the five i'm not sure thefive was labeledit says cushioned uh 37 to 43 up frontso split the difference yeah it's about40and then stable 54 to 60 split thedifference call that uh you knowi don't know 50 uh what would that be 57so i like i don't know i can tell you tothe touchthey've they're in they're pretty darnclose i mean i can't tell you if one ismore stable oror cushioned than the other but i candefinitely tell youthe fronts feel the same thesedefinitely feel the samecan't be much of a difference here andyou can clearly see it's exactly thesame shapeeverything's the same same same sameit's all the same so different colorsmaybe a differentmaterial i'm not 100 sure but it's inthe ballpark it's closethe hyper lifts are back too so theselittle drop in wedgesyou uh put these underneath the uh dropin midsole in the shoeand it adds in the men's eightmillimeters of heel to toe dropand uh you know so why would you want touse these well when you want more heelraiselike you're doing squats like you'redoing thrusters like you're doingpistolsuh you get uh you know get out of theget out of some of that ankleflexibility bypropping up your heels a little bit soeight millimeters for the menuh six millimeter in the women's andremember the stats on this shoe fourmillimeter offset or heel to toe dropeverything's the same therefore the sixmust also be a four millimeter heel totoe dropso add in your hyperlift get uh pluseight for a total of 12millimeters of heel to toe drop and uhyou knowthat's pretty good so uh my only beefwith thethe hyperlifts and i always mention thisandthe collar being so low it fits mefine without the hyperlift in but when iput the hyperlift in me personally i getheelslippage because then my heels up higherin the shoeand it's just at a point that it doesn'tfeel comfortable to me like it's notcrazy uh and unusable but it just feelsa little bit uncomfortable somy wish list for the metcon 7 isi wish they would just bring this uphigher i love them thehyperlift concept i love uh you know notbeing stuck with onesingle amount of heel to toe drop but uhit's got to work betterwith uh with the shape of the heel in myopinion souh anyways that is basically ourcomparison between the twoshoes how about the weightso uh some people have theorized thatthe uh perforated mesh upper would belighterhowever i can tell you this men's size11 and a half weighs 14.2 ounces14.2 ounces this metcon 5men's size 11 and a half weighs about13.6 ounces so about sixtenths of an ounce heavier in the metcon6compared to the metcon 5. um same sizesame basic materials i you know i can'treally explain itbut it seems that the shoe has gottenheavierand i saw the same thing in the uh thefraser edition shoe as wellthe other thing here uh what's my sizingadvice well sinceeverything is so similar the sizingadvice is get whatever size fits youbest for the fiveum if you're new to the metcon shoes andyou don't know what size you wear in themetcon 5here's what i would recommend i'd go onehalf size upwhy because this part of the shoe is alittle bit narrow it feels prettycramped to a lot of people not just mei own the metcon 5 in both 11 and 11 anda halfand i have the metcon 6 and a 10 and ahalf and an 11 and a halfi am comfortable with saying you shouldprobably go a half size up unless youhave reallynarrow feet having said that you've gotthe metcon 5 you're happy with how itfitsstick with that size you can't go wrongwith that the only other comment on thatis umi wear an 11 in every nike running shoein every other shoe like reebok adidasunder armour and really very few shoesdo i have to go a half size up so i dothink that is somethinguh particular to the nike metcon lineand uhyou know overall same sizing because theshoe is sosimilar to the metcon 5. all right sowhat aboutin the gym how does the nike metcon 6compare to the metcon 5uh so if if you could uh guessyou know because the outsole is the samethe midsole is the sameuh the shoe the shape how it works thethe flexibility it's all the same itbasically feels like the metcon 5 rightif i put these on i close my eyes ican't tell whether i'mwearing the metcon 6 or the metcon 5.people always askcan you lift weights in the metcons uhthe metcon 6 yes absolutelybecause of that stable heel therelativelylow heel to toe drop just rememberthere's not a ton of heel raise in theseunless you pop in the hyperlift and thenyou get 12millimeters total of heel to toe drop ilove to dead lift in these thoughbecause they're soflat because i don't really want a heelraise for that umother things squatting thrusters uhanything where the bar is coming off thefloorand you want to minimize ankleflexibilitythen basically pop in that hyperlift andyou're good to goso you can definitely do all kinds ofstuffheavy lifting in these if you're goingreal heavy olympic lifting seriousolympic lifting you should go with areal olympic lifter of coursebut these are great versatile shoes andyou know you can do all kinds of stuffin themthe other thing you want to know can irun in my nike metcon 6.you can run in these as well as youcould run in the nike metcon 5s what doi mean by that wellthey've got the dual density insolemidsole ratherwith the cushion up front uh which isfairly nicebut just remember the heel the midsolevery firm very stablethe heel the rubber outsole is is verysolidyou know i'll be honest these are notfantastic running shoesyou can run in them yes like if you'regonna do a wand and it's gonna doyou know you're lifting weights you gotto go for a short run you got to do boxjumpsreally that's what these are for youdon't put these on and run a 5k youdon't put these on and run a marathonand for the love of god if you'rerunning on a daily basis you should notbe running in metconsyou should get real running shoes forthat kind of stuffi have tested quite a few differentshoes i reallyprefer to have more cushion than whatyou can get in a cross trainer for anykind of long distance runningbut again having said that versatilityis the name of the game hereand uh it is a very versatile shoehow about noise uh if you remember fromthe metcon 4 we had the metcon squeakthey uh the nike metcon 4 was a verysqueaky shoebecause the uh that drop in midsolewould rub against the uhinterior of the shoe and it would makeit was quite noisyum they fixed that in the fivethe five does not make any noisethe uh the six does not make any noiseuh the only other thing is the heels ontheseare pretty solid these do have a decentamount of kind of clip clop like you'rewearing lifters if you're walking onasphalt on a tile floor on a wood floorthey're pretty noisy in that regardright just like when you're wearingliftersstill does it in the metcon 6. so samethingbecause it's so similar people if youdon't like that you don't want themetconsyou want a quiet shoe for metcons thenthenano x is going to be a better betbecause it's got a solid heelbut it doesn't do kind of that weirdclip-clop thing when you walkso overall not bad uh you know it justmakes a little bit more noise than youmight be expectingall right so the nike metcon 6 is hereit is quite similar to the nike metcon 5same shape same size mostly the samematerials the big differencethat perforated super breathable meshupperfew other minor design details like theverticalspot here and the m on the more refinedlooking heelotherwise it is very very similar to themetcon 5 get the samesize as you're wearing in the metcon 5.if you're new to the shoe go half sizeup to get a little more widthin the toe area and really you knowshould you upgrade if you're wearing themetcon 5 you're happy with the metcon 5.these aren't going to feela ton different right they're going topretty much be the sameso i don't think it's a compellingupgrade unless your fives are worn outand you look at these and you say wowthat looks great i've got to have theselike i didthen then you should get them so that'smy advice on the nike metcon 6great shoe looking forward to see whatnike does with it throughout the rest ofthe yearthank you if you like this kind ofreview please like and subscribehave a good day,1,UCx27Pkk8plpiosF14qXq-VA,SpongeBob SquarePants Official,547,338,0,21833,"['Kyrie Irving', 'Kyrie Irving

phantom venom bootsin the year since he has worn blackoutboots orange nike bootsblackout mizuno boots as well as adidaspredators and adidas coppersbut what's the significance[Music]well thiago is one of a number ofplayers who over the past yearhave ended their relationship with nikeand industry insiders suspectthis will mark the beginning of majorrealignmentin a market that has for a long timebeen taken for granted as a source ofconsiderableextra income for footballers in manycases nike themselves have taken thedecisionnot to offer renewal deals to players atthe end of their existing contractsprivately there is claim and counterclaim over whether a player has decidedto leave a brandor the brand itself has chosen to stepaway but it is absolutely clearthat there has been an exodusothers to depart include neymar rafaelvaransergio ramos and marco asensio as wellas raheemsterling bakayosaka and bayern munichpair leroy sana and robert lewandowskiand there are different explanations forthis in september 2020neymar left for puma in a deal that thebrand sawas a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity tosign an elite superstarfrom the player's perspective inaddition to a contract worth around 30million dollars a yearneymar may have been attracted by thechance to beat the standout starat puma following the rise of his psgteammate and bappeat nike in a familiar theme sourcesclose to leading players have suggestedthat elite stars requiremore attention and promotion than theyhave sometimes receivedfrom the largest brands and internalcompetition is commonfor example the athletic is aware of oneleading brazilian playerwho was unhappy to play second fiddlewhile neymarremained at nike as one agent explainsyou can sign my player but what will youdo for him will he be in the adverts orwill he stand at the back behind theother star playersbudgetary issues provoked by thepandemic have compelled nike to reducerisk by limiting their endorsement dealsthe company's co-founder phil knight hassaid that kovid19hammered us in the financial quarter tomay 31 2020and warned that it will change the wholeface of the businessadidas also saw sales fall by 90 in thefirst three months of 2020before rebounding well later in the yearand yet one well-placed industry sourcefrom a rival brand insisted that theapproach at nikeis not related to the pandemic insteadit's believed to be an internal policychange several years in the makingwith a new focus on a smaller number ofdiverse elite athletesand with themes of social justiceincorporated into campaignskillian and bappe jaden sancho andmarcus rashford are examples of clientsthat nike hopes will be at the heartof their promotions and across the restof the industrymore generally several agents andcommercial advisors to playerssay that the appetite for six figureretainers for premier league defendersor defensive midfieldersis hugely on the wane and that brandsare focusing more than everon creative talent there are stillretainers offered to elite young talentbut one agent describes the changesthese brands want to return on theirinvestment which they know they can getfrom elite senior talentbut is a teenager driving that in thesame way are you recouping six figuresbecause an arsenal defender is wearingyour boots the market has beenunrealisticand as that market adjusts aninteresting symptom of that flux isappearingthe departures from nike in particularhave shown the growing trend of playersacross europe wearing blackout bootsvarane ramos ascencio and lewandowskihave all been pictured wearing themwhile deliberating their next moveand one agent explains why when a playeris out of contract with a brand he saysthey often wear blackout boots becausethe brand will not give them moneyanymoresome will go to the extent of going tothe shop buying the boots of a brandand then spraying all over them to avoidgiving the brand marketing valuenow sometimes the plan doesn't workseveral years ago adnan yanazi wasbetween contracts at nike and newbalanceand needed to spray over his nike bootsso as not to promote the brand he hadleftyet the match played out amid heavyrainfall and over

the nike dunk low dusty olive[Music]i might actually just prefer thesebetter than the medium curriesand if you've already watched thatreview already you know how much i lovethat sneakerso that says it

leave a link down below for youguys to purchaseas well and to my knowledge these arereleasing at 95 pounds at retail pricebut for the materials you're gettingthis is an absolute stealbut before we waffle on anymore youalready knowwhat's next we are gonna have a littlebutcher's hookat the box and it does come in your redstandardnike box but the product sticker doesreads nike dunk lowspecial edition and the officialcolorway is dusty oliveand pro gold now when i first looked atthem i could have sworn they were yellowbutthat clears it all up it is of course ashade of goldsand in my head i never would have thrownthese colors together on a sneaker butthat's why i'm not on the nike designteam these colorways just bang so welland is it just me or do these sneakersgive you that travis scott vibe but justlikekafu let's bring this video right backand have a closer lookat this sneaker now the nike dunk is assimple as it comes in terms of itsdesign you can doso much with the silhouettes the colorblocking on this sneaker of coursecontrast of olives browns and goldsbut most of the materials used are ofthis suedenow it's not as hairy and rough as themedium curries it's got away nicer and softer buttery feel andeven if you stroke the toe box forexampleit's got that sort of brush like effectto the suede panel and when that happensyou just knowthese are as premium as it gets so ofcourse the toe box is that brown coloralongside the mid panels and theoverlays are the same suedein that olive colorway and the nikeswooshes are more of a darker goldcompared to the laces and the outsolebutit does indeed work well now making ourways to the tongueit is of course in that brown nylon meshand because of the change in materialsit does look like a chocolate brown butthese do come with only gold lacesand it does work well i might thinkabout swapping them with white ones butfor meas it goes these look good and we've gotthat nike tab at the top with that goldnike branding on the insole it is inthat dusty olive colorway with the goldnike branding again and on the socklinerit isof that soft cotton feel making our waysto the back we've got that nike brandingin green just on top of that gold tabit is indeed the same shade as the nikeswooshes soit's more of a darker gold and thematerials underneaththat is the same of the tongue in thatbrown color now it is your standardwhite midsole that we all know and loveon the nike dunk but what contrasts themidsole very wellis this pro gold outsole now i feel likeif they went for a brown outsole thesewouldn't have banged as much so i'm verythankful they went for that goldit just gives it that extra pop now theone thing i am happy about that i canfinally doafter this video is actually wear thesei've been holding off for a couple weeksthat i've had themjust because i wanted to keep themand span but i was very very tempted totake these out for a test drive but nowi can i'm just gonna lace these bad boysup with a nice pair of shorts or cargopantsand just like a green light these aregoodto go now we all know the story of thenike dunk's originin 1985 nike struck a deal withuniversities in america to start theprogrambe true to your school of course theuniversities includedmichigan university of kentucky iowageorgetownsyracuse st john's and unlvnow i have briefly mentioned this in mynike dunk michiganhigh review but the nike dunk has comeso far since that original releaseof course have been countless retroscountless colorways and countlesscollapsebut for me i'm always on a hunt for acolorway that is very very uniqueand this dusty olive pro gold version isrightup my alley even if i didn't get theseseeded to me by nikei would have tried to get theseregardless this colorway is justsuper super clean and unique but interms of the sizing this does fit verymuch true to size likemost dunks i have tried on and i'm nottalking about the sb dunki'm talking about your regular regulardunk because of the shape and the

i was thrashing around trying to findwhat videos i want to bring to you guysover the next few days and i hit onthese guysbut it was a real toss-up with theseguys right here this is the shadow 2.0so i was seriouslythinking that they'd be the jordan videoi do over the next few days buttoday's shoe that really it hooked me itreally hooked me in with this storyand it especially reminded me of alebron and i know we're not supposed totalk about jordans and lebrons in thesame breathbut the i promise right here 1717's aclassic shoe whether you like it or notit's an absolutekiller shoe the 17s and the i promiseit's all abouta school that lebron sponsors in hishometownand that reminded me uh what this shoe ishould say today's shoe reminded me ofthat shoe and that whole storyof uh sports stars giving back brandsgiving backand especially in education which is myfield so uh so this is why this shoewon over those 2.0 shadows which is veryvery temptingand then i got into looking at it's gota ton of really cool hits on itone small drawback but you know whatwhen you're putting moneyout there that goes straight intosomeone's pocket to help thembetter themselves and do uh you knowcreate a better lives from themselvesthrough a scholarship programi think it's well worth dipping intoyour pockets grabbing some cash andbuying yourself a pair of these guys solet's have a look atthe upcoming release of the nike airjordan 5low wingsthis is the tokyo about the 23-secondchannelmy name is design every single day fromtokyo japan i bring you content aboutupcoming secret releases snicker newsfor sticker reviewsand today it's all about the upcomingrelease of the night gear jordan 5low wings which is a great name for theshoea because the whole wings logo withjordan line but b because the wingsscholarship program is what we'retalking about and it's that program thatbasicallybuying these shoes a chunk of the moneyis going to go into that program so justyou could you could just park it rightthere because you know what i feel likehelping somebody out i've spenta couple hundred bucks in a really sweetpair of shoes butalso buying for myself a bit of peace ofmind i'm helping somebody elsein need out there and these times thesedays uh with the pandemic out therehelping people in need is a priority fora lot of people so uhso great shoe that wings program fromjordan uh you know it's inspiredapparently by something to do with thesecoaches about howthey always made him feel like he wasyou know could achieve and coulduh go to his fullest he said reach hismaximum potentialand the idea was something about ifyou're given a chanceeverybody can fly hence the wings uhname of the scholarship program and howthatis tying out with the jordan line ofcourse the wings and jordan themselvesso uh so it's a great shoe it's a greatstorya great reason for you to thinkseriously about getting these guysand like i said it's a great lookingshoe but with one tiny drawback one tinydrawback i'm gonna go straight to thatfirstand then we'll get into the other like99 if it's a drawback is a negativething would it be a drawforward for something that's so greatthat's uh because the rest of the shoeisall plus but this right here is just myone little sort of like ohand it's the mesh or the the nylon orthe man-madematerials that are in the tongue on thatnot the tongue bone headthe toe on these guys i was reallylooking for an all-over leather feel tothemum but that like toe on there just feelsa little bit cheapand it just really disappoints mebecause it's a sleek looking shoe frontto back a really clean shoe now i'vealready hada jordan 5 low it was the chinese newyears umand i can kind of give you a look atthose guys so it's the second chinesechinese second jordan 5 low in the firsthalf of 2021 so maybe there's a thingabout that coming around but these guysare totally different from those chinesenew year'sthey're very very sleek very cleanalmost completely black shoeuh which is very evident actually on themedial side so i might as well jump tothe medial side before we get into the main details on the shoe you cansee just how black these guys are andthere's just that onesharks tooth sticking up uh right aroundabout the midfoot area where you seethat gold comecoming up from the outsole through ontothe midsole and uhinto the the upper part of the shoe andit's those gold sharks teethwhich we'll see back boom to the lateralside you see there's a lot moredefinition on the lateral sidea lot more detailing and that sleekblack feel of the medial side is nowgiven overto a sleek black side and lateral sidebut with a few more hitsin there and now those sharks teeth tobe in the main sort of draw that drawsyour eyes in sonow we're back on the lateral side we'lljust quickly go to that mid-footmesh section on there you see that it'sgot very little treatmentat all um just basically clear meshlooking througha black background which fits the shoesvery very neatly and there are ways toplay around with thatuh choose different colors for exampleput a pattern behind it for example adifferentyou know color on top and color belowand stuff like that but they've gonewith a very simplelook which matches the rest of the shoeknobs but a bit of a plusfor me if you're asking um but then thethe main detail on the lateral side isdown on the heelwhere you see a bit of branding and thenpicture i'm probably showing you rightnow it says 20uh and later i'll be able you know whatin fact i'm not going to do it laterright now we're going to look along thetightest angle i could find this is likeif we're on 90 degrees is looking atsomething in the face we're on like onedegree to get that tiny littlesleek look at these guys and you can seeon the left shoeon that heel branding that says 20 andthen on the rightshoe on the same heel branding spot itsays 21 because this is all about theclass of 2021 and theirscholarships that they're going to carrythrough uh their lives soum so that's why it says to 20 on thethe left of the the left shoe thelateral side left shoeand 21 on the lateral side of the rightshoe uh but then if we come up from thatuh i'm going to go there first and i'llcome back down to the heel uh we want tolook intothe tongues on the back end of thetongue it's got standard jordan brandingon the back of the right foot tonguebut on the back of the left foot tonguein this gold uh standard that's comingthrough the whole shoe you can see thatactually says class2021 in there which is the other placethere's only two realsignificant places where they talk aboutthe class of 2021 and that's on thoseheelbranding points but also up here behindthe tongue onlyon the left shoe and since we're upthere we might as well flip it out andlook down from above and you get to seea that the tongues themselves are sortof a very deepalmost charcoal gray but not quite blackbut on top of thatyou see you've got the uh the jumpman umembroidered and near the top of thetongues but then behind thatif we look down onto the insoles you cansee there's this huge kind ofit almost looks like the sort of um thething that you'd get on a certificateto prove it's authentic i don't knowwhat you'd call it some kind of stamp orsomethingof authenticity and this beautiful kindof massivestar-styled uh disc right there on theinsoles in golduh which is another sort of nod to thatclass of 2021 that whole sort ofgraduating scholarship feeluh that authentic kind of feel that's onthe shoes now you know what i'm going todo that now is i'm just going to jumpback to that brandingon the 20 of the lateral side of theleft shoe because there's one thing imeant to mentionwas it isn't gold which is the secondsort of color running through the shoeafter the blacklike those gold sharks teeth but it'salso got a blackshadow effect stitched into it there's akind of neatfeel to it gives it a 3d effect which ikind of really really diguh but then coming off of that i mightas well travel down even further and goto the lowest point of theshoe um which is the outsoles and theni'll go back to the heels again sothere's one more detail on the heels butlooking at the outsoles it's basically ablack and translucentoutsole but zoomed in on the front endof that the front part of thetranslucentyou can see it looks through the twothings one is a jumpmandeep within that midsole and outsolesort of unit and the other is there's akind of it's almost like a marbledpattern effect behindthe front end of the translucence whichgives it a really sort ofclassic feel to it so the thetranslucent's on thereuh and then in the middle that's thefront the back of the outsole and thattransitions but in the middle you'll bethat solid that blackchunk of material uh but then i want togo back to those heels like i said whichis probably the place we'll finish upthis videotrying to think if there's anythingmissing um but on the back endalso you've got a jump man black onblack embroidered in the the back end ofthe shoes on the the heelsand there was something missing i knewthere was something missing there alwaysis something missing i never remembereverything about every shoeuh but it's the hang tag a very specialunique hang tag with the word wings forthat wingsscholarship program uh so this is areally important shoe as far as likeyou know giving back to the communityit's got bigger story than justyou know a 200 shoe that you can buy andenjoy wearing it's got something a bitmore to itand that wings logo hanging on the sidethere that hang tagis a great way to finish it up and sortof reinforce that ideathat buying these guys a significantchunkier money is going to be goingtowards helping somebody out out thereand that's a great way to finish thisvideo and just wrap it up so it's abeautiful shoe very sleekmostly black but those hits of goldthroughout and especially that class of2021fuel to the shoe just raises up a littlebit aboveand takes it to a next level and like isaid there's been a few uhjordan 5 lows especially those chinesenew years and seems to besomething more i think there's also apair of golf shoesin the jordan 5 low line as well so uhso sorry to you guys out there thatmaybe we're looking for thatjordan 1 hi to shadow 2.0 i really didseriously think about doing thatbut to be honest i don't like to reviewthat many jordan sneakers

hi welcome to the running channel i'mkate and today i'm going to be taking afirst look at the brand new nikevaporfly next percentversion 2. but first up if you're newaround heredon't forget to like and subscribe andyou'll get notified when we upload newcontent which we doevery week okay well let's have a lookat these shoesnow as you can see nike have changed thecolorsfor this version of the next percentit's umi think a rather nice kind of sea greenyblue colorso first look at the shoe if you look atthe sole of the shoeand especially compared to the versionone you can probably seepretty much identical obviously theseones are a bit grubby because i've wornthembut yeah there's not a lot of differencethere in fact nike say that thedifference in the shoesbetween the version two and the versionone is all in the upperthe top half of the shoe so the bit thatgoes over the top of your footand the changes that nike have made aremainly to do with comfortwith locking your foot in more and withdurability these are premium superpricey shoes for racing and you know youwant to get as many miles out of them aspossibleum if you're going to pay that money youexpect a bang for your buck i guessif you look at the um different fabricsit's um obviously i can feel it and youcan't this is the the first version is abit more kind of slippery feel to iti guess a little bit more plastickyfeeling the new version feels much morekind of like nike's classic flyknitbut that is supposed to hold your footin a bit more and supposed to bemore durable if you're prone to kind ofcoming through the toes of your trainersthe lacing area the bit around the lacesagain bothoffset not straight down the middlebut the new version seems a little bitmore robust to melike i mean i've not had any problemswith the old one but the the sort ofbit here right around the lacing thatseemsperhaps a little bit more solidthe heel area the construction is veryslightly different you can see there's asort of raised areacompared to the simple plain oneum that might be just to help lock theheel inso that when you're running and you'regetting the spring effect of the shoesyour heel stays in place and talking ofthe spring effect obviously the mainthing with these shoes that you can'tseebut that is inside is the carbon fiberplate running through the middlethat again is the same as the firstversionand that is what gives you that reallykind of propulsiveforward motion spring that makes theseshoes so fastiterations of these shoes are the onesthat have been wornin lots and lots of races now andlots of world records broken in them umand whether or not you think you'rehappy with the carbonfiber plate issue is it's up to youit's it's here to stay okay now are youeven a real shoe geek if you don't wearyour shoesi promise i never do that except forvideos really i'm not that sadum so uh got my kitchen scales out i'mgonna first of allweigh the alpha flies these are the thesort of very very very topof the range ones and they weigh in theuk size 8216 gramsso the next percent version one 187gramsand next percent version two justchecking i haven't left anything in them193 grams soa tiny tiny tiny bit heavier than thesewhich might be just the difference inmaterialand the uh additional padding in thetongue idon't think that you're really going tobe able to blamethose five grams or not getting a pbi'm afraidfor me uh nike always tend to fittrue to size certainly feel similar fittoall the other ones i've tried so you cansee the tongue does stick upquite a lot more there um it's kind ofslightly offset as welland that again might help with thecomfort of that areaoh gosh it's nice to feel bouncy yeah asyou'd expect you really feel that kindofpropulsion um that kind of plate rockingyou forwardwhen you stand in these shoes you alwaysfeel that kind of weirdrocking if you could kind of just standlike this um kind of makes you want togo like thatwhich of course is the whole point ofthese shoes so my first thoughts havingtaken these for alittle spin um obviously as you'd expectthey feelpretty similar to the next version onegiven that the the sole and the plateare the sameum but what's interesting is they dofeela little bit more like your foot maybefeels a little bit more locked ina lot of people used to say about thenext percent thefirst version but they felt slightlynervous going around tight bendsum because your foot sort of you couldfeel it maybe moving around a biti feel like maybe that is more stable inthis versionuh which is interesting super comfyin terms of uh the sort of quicknessum i mean they don't feel like massivelydifferent to the next and version onesso i wouldn't say they're like quick oranything but then i don't think like youclaiming they are soif you liked the first ones then you'lllike theseum i don't think any of the changes willsort of be a negative for anybodyum they're still super comfy to wearand you still feel that probably thatpropulsionforward that you get from the platethoughts after my first run they feelvery similar as you'd expect as i saidto the firstnike next percent which means in my bookthey're still an amazing shoethe next percent is my favorite of thenike racesand all the improvements that they'vemade um do feel like they're a goodthingnothing's changed in the feel of it itstill feels fastspringy like you want to save it forrace daypb shoes basically of course everybodyhasdifferent feelings about shoes and youknow one man's amazing shoe is anotherperson's blister-inducing nightmareum so you know you have to try outthings yourself but to methese are a great shoe one thing that'sreally interesting is that they'veactually reduced the price slightlythe original next percents were twothree nineninety five let's call it 240. um andthese are retailing now at 209.95so 30 quid cheaper which is interestingum and i wonder if it justreflects the volume of sales maybe idon't know why that is but it's you knowit's a good thingum and what's interesting is as well astherefore being 30 pounds cheaper thanthe first modelthey are now um a significant 50 quidcheaper than the alpha flieswhich are still around 260 pounds nowthese are an amazing shoe uh they're aworld recordbeating shoe but i actuallyhave kind of always preferred the nextpercents umi find the afterfly sort of stack heightand so on just a little bit kind ofi don't know it just throws me a littlebit i find these moremore of a natural ride umit feels silly to say natural becauseobviously you're running on a carbonfiber plate that's propelling your footforward there's not an awful lot naturalabout itbut you forget about that very veryquickly i feel slightly more consciousof the fact that i'm wearing thesecrazy shoes when i'm wearing these crazyshoes umso for me these are the best ones uh butthat's just my personal opinion but thefact that they are now 50 quid cheaperthan the alpha fly might also helppeople toperhaps make their mind up because youknow at the end of the day it's a lot ofmoney to spend on a pair of shoesfinal thoughts i guess i mean i wouldrace in them i love themi am a huge fan of the nike knicks sensei've run pvs in themum i think i ran my 5k and 10k pb inthemum i would totally wear these againum love the color and yeah i meanthe only thing you have to decide iswhen they work for you andis it worth the money because it's a lotof money um that's a decision that onlyyou can make,17,UCk9BijsQy-armZbzjowGwOw,Max Lang,33,6,0,264,"['NIKE Savaleos',

today we're going to be talking aboutb-grade nikes and jordans we're going togo over if they're real if they're fakewhat you think about it is it okay tocollect them i got a bunch of differentquestions i got some different answersfrom peopleand i'm excited to share the resultswith you guys and obviously educate youand help you understand the differencebetween an authenticand a b grade all right let's get it[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already don't forgetto hit the subscribe button join thefamily join the squad and smash the likebutton because that helps the algorithmowe so much and with all that being saidwe need to talk about b grades brobecause a lot of people have somemisconceptions about this shoeand i want to clear it all up for youguys today so i went to instagram and iasked my followers three questions ifyou haven't alreadymake sure you follow me on ig so thatway you can participate in the polls aswellthe first question was are b grade nikesand jordans considered to be fake thesecond question was is it okay to rockor collect bgrades and the third and final questionwas is this band 1fire or trash stick around to the end ofthe video to see what the results areyou're going to be really shocked sofirst off let me explain what a bgrade is a b grade is a sneaker that hasa defect to itin some type of way and quality controldid not pass itand allow it to be sold to the publicbecause they didn't think that it metthe standardof what they wanted for their product atthe retail price so when the shoe isbeing manufacturedthey could have a potential mess up theycould put too much glue on it ormis-stitch the patternor miss the laces or have somethingwrong with it where there's a scuff onthe side of the footor whatever it may be there could besome small small blemishes thatsometimes you can never even telland then sometimes there's huge thingsthat's like i can definitely tell thisis a b-grade shoebecause the pattern of the shoe is alittle bit off and it's kind of lopsidedor the outsole was put on incorrectly orsomething like that but there are somany different reasons as to whyquality control will not allow it topass so for example say nike wants tomake a hundred thousand pairs of asneakerand they have ten thousand pairs weremessed up that's a huge problem theydon't wanna have ten thousand pairsmessed upthey don't wanna just trash them andthrow them away so what were they gonnadothey're gonna put them at stores likeross and nike outlets and differentthings like thatand sell the sneaker at a discountedrate so that way they can still makesome money off of the shoeand not just take a complete loss sowhen it comes to finding bgrade sneakers again like i just saidross nike marshalls different placeslike thator where are you going to be able tofind the good licks on a b grade shoesometimes b grades even have the entirebox all the laces and they look likethere's nothing wrong with the shoeand then there can be other times wherethey have a replacement box with adifferent tagand the shoe may look like there'ssomething wrong or there's like a gluestain on it or a mid-stitch pattern butyou can't really tell too muchand you can get away with it and you'llbe like okay that's cool i justbasically got the same exact shoe for adiscounted ratecan't be mad at it so for example wehave the cap and gown air jordan13 right here and this is a b grade shoeit comes in a different boxwith the nike lid and obviously a nikebox that you typically get for any othernike shoenot a jordan brand sneaker like youwould get with the black box with thejumpman on it and different things likethatso that's already one thing that isnoticeable about a b grade compared to aregular retro that released to thepublicfor retail the next thing to look for isthe stamp on the boxwhere it says cosmetic seconds that'sinitial telltale right therethis is a b grade so if you look at thetag on the box right here air jordanretro 13and it has the same type of tag that youwould typically get on an air jordan boxbut they put that on this box to let youknow this is a shoe that is a jordanbut we're putting it in this box becauseit's a secondary one we don't reallyfeel like producing the real box thatyou needbecause we already know this shoe has adefect so when i open the box right hereas you can see we have an air jordanretro 13 in all black when you take afirst glance at this shoehonestly it's hard to see any defectsand it looks actually really good butfor some reason nike decided to makethis a bgrade and not release it to the publiclike they would the retail versionso let's figure out why so looking atthe outsole it looks pretty good workingmy way up to the midsole things arelooking goodthere's a small patch of glue just alittle bit right here by the toe areaand honestly that's about the only thingthat is wrong with this shoeso you can literally buy this shoe at adiscounted ratebecause it has a little glue stain righthere on the shoe which you can see rightthere in a detailed shotand i think when you're wearing itnobody's even gonna notice another hugething to note iswhen you look inside of the size tagright here there's a bstamp in red on the inside of the sizetag right here you're going to see thatat nike outlets at ross whenever a shoeis considered to be a b grade it'salways going to have that stampwith the b inside of it on the shoesometimes it may be in red and sometimesit may be a blue stamp but either wayit's always going to be on the sizetag inside that shoe so overall thisshoe may be decreased in value becauseit's considered a bgrade but at the end of the day youcould still resell it for money andstill be able to make a profiton a sneaker like this especially whenyou see a small defectthat's really barely noticeable andhonestly it's only on one foot it's noteven on the left foot it's only on theright side so really finding somethinglike this is always a good deal in myopinion so just like you saw right thereon those 13syou can see that it had a different boxand yes it has a glue stain butessentiallyyou're getting a great deal on a shoethat nobody's really going to know whenyou're wearing it on your feet and ithink that springs up the next one rightherethis shoe is called the air jordan 1band as you can see it has a special boxwith the x on hereit has the what if with the price tag igot these for 109.99they originally wanted these to be soldfor 125at the suggested retail price but theydidn't even do that and they discountedthem even morebecause they had a defect on each andevery shoe from the entirebatch so this shoe right here actuallynever came out to the publicat like a foot locker or a champs oreast bay or something like that or evennike.comit only released at nike outlets andthere was actually basically like arelease for itbecause when people found out they endedup doing a launch for it at the storesso me personally when this shoe came outi knew it was a diamond in the rough andthat's one thing that i love aboutshopping for b grades and differentoutlet finds because you can find somegreat shoesfor a really good deal so i just want toopen this up and show you guys this shoeright herei bought over 20 pairs of these at thefactory store and each and every singleshoehad a defect to it but what i did was ihad picked up multiple size 13sand all i did was pick out the best twoshoes left and right so when i hadbought these from the storei bought all of the pairs in the size13. i picked out the best twoand then i kept these in my collectionbecause i know this was the best lookingoneof those versions but one thing thatthey did have a problem with when itcame to thesewas the stitch on the leather and thenthe cut of the leather and the placementof it also there was fading on theleather as welland then there were some other problemswith promo and different things likethatbut they just could never get it rightwhen it came to this shoe so some peoplehave some terrible versions of thissneakerand other people have some really nicelooking versions like this one as wellbut at the same time 110 dollars for ashoethat is now worth roughly 2 000 you seewhat i'm saying you can definitely get agoodsneaker at a ross or an outlet orsomething like that that's superexclusive super rare sometimeseven like a sample type sneaker theyhave shoes like that so neverunderestimate bgrades again just to reiterate b gradesare notfake shoes they are a shoe with a defectthat came directly from nikeand is even sold at a nike outlet storeagainb grades are not fakes so like i askedwith the questions earlierlet's get into the results and see whatother people think and what other peoplesaybecause i think you might be shocked bythese results so the first question arebgrade jordans and nikes fake 26 percentof the people said yeshonestly i think that is a problem theyare notfake they just have a defect and ialready explained all that stuff to youso i think that negative stigma rightthere that already gets put on itand people thinking that they're fake ihope that they understand by the end ofthis videothat it is okay to get b grades and theyare authenticand they are legit the only thing isthey have a small defect so the nextquestion is it okay to rock or collectb grades and honestly i think yes it isokaybut this is what the people said 19 ofthe people said no81 said yes the same 19 of the peoplethat said bgrades were fake in the last poll alsosaid that it's not okayto buy them rock them or collect them sothey think that it's not okay to do itbecause they're fake but realisticallythey're not fakeso people are missing out on great dealsbecause they have a wrong mindseton a shoe that is actually authenticjust with the defense so this next oneisvery funny i literally took the band oneand i said is this shoefire or is this shoe trash and it ishilarious what the results saybecause 93 of the people set fire andseven percent of the people said trashall those people that were literallyjust saying it's not okayand they're fakes and all thesedifferent things just contradictedthemselvesand now they're talking about oh thisshoe is fire this shoe is dope but youjust said it's not okayso people have to understand thatsometimes people just don't get it and ihopethis video helps people get it because ihear a lot of people out therethat are confused and don't understandthat and talk bad about peoplethat buy b grades and that maybe that'sonly they can affordbut it's the same thing it's okay and ijust want to keepreiterating that it is okay to rockcollect have b grades in your collectionso what do you guys think about theresultsdrop a comment down below i'm excited tohear what you have to say because to meit is hilarious how they say oh it's badto have b grades or bgrades or fake but then when i pull up ashoe like this oh it's a grill and allthose different things souh i think you should pick size and gowith the right answer and say yes it'sokay to collectb grades or have them in your collectionand yes theyare real and yes these are dope don'tjust be likeoh it's bad try to create a negativestigma to this shoeor to a b grade not knowing that theyare authenticeverything is great they just had asmall defect to the shoe so i hope youguys enjoyed this videoi had a pretty good time seeing theresults just kind of laughing and seeingthat the same exact peoplethat voted all this is bad literallyhyped up the band once and we're takingtime to dm meto tell me how dope the band one was butthennegative vibes when it came to nothaving b grades or bgrades were fake bro these are b gradeslikewhat do you not get so anyways that's mytime don't forgetto like comment share and subscribe igots to goi'm gone

hi guys ian from the football boots teamand today in another episode of thefootballshow i'm going to be talking about whyneymar has ended upat humor there are a lot of questions toanswer about this and in this video i'llbe getting into all of the detailsbut first off i want to take a littlestep back and discuss how we got to thispoint so back in 2013neymar was the face of the hypervenomwhen they came outa massively successful boot for nike andthat was when neymar really burst ontothe stages around the time of his moveto barcelona things are going reallywell for him that was kind of the peakperhaps of things with neymar so hestarts off and he's wearing thehypervenoms very successful with thelaunchthey move on he goes to the 2014 worldcup and he got his ownspecial edition golden dreams so thosewere thegold uh boot yellow sole and it was allbased on the inspiration of he used tospray his boots goldwhen he was a kid these are fantastic umreleases they were just a specialeditionand he didn't really get to wear them ithink he maybe got a half in them orsomething and obviously got his backinjury at the tournament so moving on hecarried on wearing the hypervenoms heloved the hypervenoms a lot of peoplekind of now think they're a boot thedecadethey um that kind of grippy upperneymar's a big fan of them now rememberthese are with the low collar that'llget more importantas we get on in this episode um so hemoved on from those he then went on towear the liquid dreamsnow the liquid dreams were a silverversion a signature editionfor uh neymar and they were silverversion pretty much of the golden dreamsbut they did have this pinkaccent to them and that's going to beimportant as well he went on and it gotto the point that that was kind of thelastish pair that he wore of the originalhypervenomsthen they changed into the hypervenomtwos and this is where things started toget a little bitdownhill for the relationship perhapsbetween nike andneymar now some of the things i say inthis video are going to be my opinionsthey're not necessarily factsjust what i think about it so i don'twant to get myself into trouble withnike or with neymarbut i'm going to tell you how i see itand how i interpret what happens soneymar is wearing the hypervenom twosthese are now the oneswith the collar on them he doesn't likethem as much as he likedthe original boots it doesn't really geton with them as muchover time nike then released a new upperas kind of upgrade to the upper to tryand solve some of the problems whichreally took us backto a more similar upper they also hadthe finish available which was the lowversion neymar would be seen wearingthose a little bitso those type of venom twos this is whenwe started to see the collabbetween jordan and neymar and these aresome of the bestkind of collab boots that we've seen theproblem is is neymarstill doesn't like the hypervenom atthis point and he doesn't really likewearing them somuch in fact that they bought out ablack pair and a white pair and ibelieve the black oneshe was just seen wearing the finishedversion he wasn't wearing the ones withthe collarbut the main problem wasn't just thecollar on there he didn't like that butalsothe upper it just didn't suit him so hewants to wear the vaporsand so he actually gets nike to make hima pair of vaporsthat are disguised to look like thehypervenoms that he's supposed to bemarketingso you might have heard about thisbefore but in essence the boots when yousee them close up you can tell thatthey're a pair of mercurial vaporsbut they've been painted up and designedto look like the hypervenoms that he'sactually marketingso there is a real big kind of issuenike tried to work it out by making themlook like what is marketing but it's abig problem when your player doesn'tlikethe boots that he's being paid to wearso eventually neymar manages to gethimself out of the hypervenomshypervenom moves on to the hypervenomthrees it's not an amal thingneymar is in the vapors and nike takethat on board and they decide to makehim kind of the big face of the vapoursbut this is where the problem is is thatthe vapor isn't really nike's high-endoffering in the mercurial linethey're all ways trying to put peopleinto the superflyso with this superfly you've got thelikes of ronaldo in themyou've got vape in them and you've nowgot sancho in them as wellthat is their elite offering and thevapor is underneath it so it's a bit ofa problemwhen you've got one of your headlineplayers wanting to wear that boot thatisunderneath but nike went with it andthey created the written in the starsvapers for himnow those ones were based on hisachievements with brazil they're kind ofa blueboot uh star details on them and they'reactually very nice kind of signatureedition for himmoving on when we got to the 2018 worldcup that was whenneymar got his mo jogo boots they were apair of yellow boots amarilloand he got to wear those in action atthe world cup that was a troublesomeworld cup for him everybody was justsuggesting that he was diving androlling over and things like that so itwasn't really great for himwith the kind of pr thing perhaps hejust took another little bit of a hitto his profile as a big star playermoving on nike would give him the vaporsthe vapor 12sthey'd also then give him his speedfreaks and then they would go on fromthat into the last ones that we've seenum the white ones with all the differentneymar logos on it now there's been alot of changes in the nomar logothey've never managed to stick to onething which is a little bit confusingbut it's going to be useful for pumabecause it's anotheranother new logo for neymar he's gone topumaand he's going to get this new logo sothe thing ishe actually had a year left on hiscontract with nike so i'm not surewhat's happened there whether it's gotpaid upum or they've just torn it up or whatthe thing was but neymarisn't getting the position that he wantsto have with nikeso mbappe his teammate at psghe's a bigger deal now to nike thanneymar isand bappe's won the world cup andbappy's got to the final of thechampions leagueobviously neymar was there as well butneymar is playing second fiddle tombappe in the psg team and he doesn'twant to play second fiddle to himat nike so it's a case of well maybehe'll go back to barcelona or somethinglike thatmy question would be is if he goes backto barcelona how is that relationshipbut puma gonna be with griezmann he'sthe headline player with the ultrasnow talking about the ultras we haven'tseen neymar movedirectly into wearing the ultra straightaway i think everybody was expecting tosee that when they hear that he's gonnago to puma it's like okay well he'sgonna be in the ultrasand i think pure have done really wellby putting him in the puma kingsand having this whole the king is backthing i think it's a great bit ofmarketing it's a great bit of stuffthat's pushing people to noticethe puma king platinums now lukaku atinter milan has been banging in thegoalswearing those boots not sure what he'sgoing to be wearing this season but he'sgot a lot of goals wearing those bootsand it's just great to see them on thepitch now the boots that you've seenneymar wearingthey're not actually available at retailand it just seems like they've had torush this out it seems to have beenquite a quick decisionand one of the things and i've got thislittle bit of a kind of inside thoughtthat i'll give you in a secondbut one of the things it seems to berushed out because they've had to getsilny art to come along and there's theblackoutboots and he's whited out the swoosh ofthe little swords the form stripe onthereso then you can see that really standout on pitch and then added on theneymar logo as welland you can see all these custom bootsthey were all blackouts and he'd addedthe white paint to them to be wornso there hasn't actually been any timeto get anything specifically set up forneighbor neymar now talking aboutspecifically set up and talking aboutthose liquid diamonds that i talkedabout before if you see the pink on theswooshon the phantom gts now when nike bringout a new bootthey normally have a headline wearer ican't saythat i can think of anybody who wasreally the headline wearerwhen the phantom gts came out now theycould have used kevin de bruynethey could have used kai hubbards theycould have used lewandowskii mean lowendasies had a mad season ifthey could have got him into those bootsum then he would be in a great kind ofheadline wearer for it they could haveused harry kane who was the headlinewearerfor the phantom venoms now i understandthat kopit 19's been around and it'smade it harder for them to getmarketing materials and things set upbut i just have a suspicionthat nike planned on having neymarheadlinethe phantom gts and this is the kind ofinside kind ofthought that i've got about what's goingon i think that neymar was supposed tofront these boots i thinkthat the way that these are set up itjust reminds me of what they've donewith neymar before and i think neymarwas supposed tofront the phantom gts you will have seenthat neymar did wear the phantom gtsin blackout in training earlier in theyear so they're giving them a goremember that these are on thehypervenom last so that meansthat the way the the sole of the boot isdesigned it is the sameso it's designed to suit the boot thatname our lightyes it comes with a collar it also comeswith the low so it would have made sensethat perhaps they would have been happyfor neymar to wear the low versionand just give him some white socks orsomething to make it look like he waswearing the hibut the other thing is i believe thatnike planned on havinga signature edition phantom gt forneymarit would have come out in the nextmonths or so i believeclearly that's not going to happenanymore but i believe that nike wantedto get neymar into the phantom gts theystill wanted him aroundbut they wanted him to headline theseobviously he's tried themand he's decided he wanted to stick tothat kind of vapor feel of a boothe didn't want to come and use theseboots and it's come to a headand he said you know what i don't wantto carry on and then he's gone to pumathey've had a conversation they'veobviously worked out the money and allthose kind of thingsand he's also getting that recognitionthat he's just not gettingif he goes to puma he's their nightnumber one number two playergriezmann and neymar that's all there isfor puma other playersa little bit further down the lineyou're not talking about um your balletsor james madison'sor players like that even marco royceplayers like that they're just not quitethatelite level when you look at nikethey've got a lot of elite level playersso they've got ronaldo they've gotmbappe they've got sancho to headlinethe mercurialsthey can now just take the vapor and sayyou know what it's just that littlenotchbelow again they can carry on with themarketing their way the way the way theywere beforeobviously it's a slight issue a slightvacuum in what they're doing with thephantom gts but i say come on getlewandowski in them as soon as possiblehe is clearly the headline player forthose he should have won the bang ondoor this yearthe guy won everything possible in thiscalendar yearhe was the top goal scorer in all thosecompetitions and they've taken theballon d'or away from him and i thinkthat's a crying shame because heabsolutely deservesto have won that um and then obviouslyharry kane and a few other players likede bruyne and kylie hubbard now he's atchelsea he's going to stand out a bitmore probablythey're going to be the players thatyou're going to see with the phantom gtsbut i do think that nike originallyplannedto have neymar in them and i think hewas having none of it and i think nowhe's gone to the puma kings how long helasting the puma kings i will besurprised to seei think maybe maybe we'll see a specialedition of the ultras or something maybea super light version or somethingmaybe they'll even tie in and make it aneymar edition but they are going to tryand get himinto those as soon as possible i am surebut it will be interesting to seewhether he likes the design of those itis a lot wider in the forefoot but havea think about itand see what you think neymar i supposehe's got time and um he's gonna have

hi everyone kevin here from golf guyreviews and in this video today i'mgoing to give you my full reviewof the nike air max 270g golf shoesnow these currently retail in the uk for130 poundsand 150 dollars in the us so that'squite a significant amount of moneyfor a trainer style pair of golf shoesso you're going to want to stick aroundand watch this videobecause i'm going to let you knowexactly how they fit on feet as well ashow they performedout on the golf course and i'm going totell you whether or not i think theseare worth the 130 poundsso i really hope you enjoyed this videotoday hit that like button if you doand let's jump straight in now for thoseof you who follow my channel and havewatched my previous videosyou might notice that in my first lookvideo of these shoesi had a different colorway i initiallygot them in thebone and hot punch colorway and in theukthat was the original colorway launch aswell as a black versionhowever then a couple of days later theylaunched this dusty cactus version aswellso actually personally i prefer thiscolorway so i bought them instead andsent back the hot punch and bone now atthe moment in the ukthis colorway is pretty much sold out aswell as the black version as wellso you can only get that bone and hotpunch one there wasalso a white and blue colorway i'm notsure whether it launched in the ukor if it was only in the us but i'mpretty sure there's going to be someother colorways launching as welland already even within the first fewweeks of launch there's an energyversion as wellwhich is in what was the name of thecolortwilight marsh and ember where are theygetting these color names from they'rejustanyway so yeah you've got a fewdifferent color options depending uponwhat you likejust depends upon whether you canactually get your hands on them nowbefore we go through how these fit andperform out on the golf courselet's just quickly run through some ofthe design details and the look of theshoe now nike is saying these are astitch for stitch reconstructionof the original 270 trainers but thentailored to work out on the golf courseand i've got to saylooking at them you could probably getaway with saying these pretty much looklike a normal pair of 270sapart from obviously this prettyexaggerated sole pattern which we'llcome on to in a little bitand as well as the feel of the upperbecause this has got a textured overlaymaterial on it to help with thewaterproofness of the shoesas well as helping them stop gettingstained but generally in regards to thatsilhouettei'd say they've done a really reallygood job and you can easily wear thisoff of the coast as well as onnow the first thing that really grabsyour eye when it comes to the 270is this ginormous air bubble at the backof the shoeand that's where it gets its name frombecause it's going 270 degrees aroundthe back of the shoe i personallyhaven't got out my compass and measuredit so i'm going to take nike's word thatthat is 270 degrees around the back ofthe showbut it is a really really significantair bubble at the time of launchingthese trainers this was the biggest airbubble that they'd ever puton a pair of trainers and it does reallyreally help in regards to the comfort ofthe shoe especially in this hill areait is nice and squishy and soft at theback of the shoein regards to the look of that airbubble thenit's probably up to you if you like thelook of 270 trainers then you're goingto like the look of theseit's actually grown on me to be honestand i have quite enjoyed wearing thisout on the course and i did get quite afew compliments actuallyeven from some of the older members ofmy golf courseas a bit of a surprise to me actually umso yeah let me know down in the commentswhat do you think of the look of theseshoesa quick note on some of the stylingdetails so you can see here that you'vegot the nike swoosh on the lateral aswell as the medial side and the shoesand you've got a little one two there onthe lateral side of the toe boxand you can see here you've got some 270logos as well so you've got one on theinside thereyou've got what's that say golf 27e onthe lateral side of the heeland you've got that unique golf 270 logoon the tongueyou've also got golf 270 on the hillpooland then also there was another thing iwas going to point out oh yeah you cankind of hopefully see that on the videothereyou've actually got air in this kind ofpadded form on the hillthere you've also got these nice kind ofaccents and layers which justcan't naturally come from the originaldesign of the shoe but also what i doquite like as well is thathopefully this kind of area around thetoe box there is going to help a littlebit in regardsto protecting the upper when you swingout on the course and you can see aswell on the inside the actual rubberpart of the trainer and the grip comesup a little bit on the toe box areaagain to help with that kind ofprotecting the midsole on the inside ofthe shoeanother element as well with the shoethat i just wanted to point out is thatyou've got this external tpu heelcounter hereand it's been made to kind of blend inwith the shoe i think nike have done areally good job of that because it isquite seamless actuallybut if you look really closely they arevery much two separate pieces ofmaterial therenow the last thing i wanted to talkabout with the upper as well is as imentioned initially this is a meshmaterial underneathbut nike put an overlay on the top of itto help with the waterproofness of theshoesand i did my full golf guy reviewswaterproof testso i poured over these shoes 300milliliters of waternot only on the upper but also on thetongue area as welland i'm pleased to say that they havepassed the test with flying colorsunlike a lot of golf shoes that i testthese let no water in whatsoever and myfeet stayed completely dryso that's really impressive for a pairof you know sneakerstyle golf shoes one of the main reasonsfor that is actually because of thisupper constructionit kind of looks like maybe you've got atongue area here but you can clearly seethat there is no tongue with this shoethis is a one-piece constructionand so that's got its positives and itsnegatives in regards to the positivesyou can seethat you know it didn't let any water inwhatsoever because the lacesare just attached to the outside of theshoe on these um they're not actuallyweaving their way into the shoeum and it also gives you quite aninteresting fiti'm not entirely sure whether to putthat down as a positive or negativebecause it's totally up to you how youlike the feel of your shoeswhat i would say in regards to the fitof the upper of the shoe is that it fitsvery very close um so you can reallyfeelquite a lot of i wouldn't say pressurethat's the wrong word but you candefinitely feel the upper materialcertainly for meon the lateral side of the top part ofthe shoe hereand also means that it can be a littlebit tricky to get on because you can'treally pullthe tongue out the way it just kind ofstays there and it also means that youcan't really adjust the fit of the shoeeitherum when you do the shoes up you're justkind of bunching the material across thetop of the shoe reallyyou're not really pulling them you knowthe sides of the upperover your shoe there so it's kind of upto you on that one in regards to the fiti didn't mind it personally i quite likea feeling of being quite close to theshoebut definitely that's something to beaware of something else to highlightwith the fit of the shoes as wellbecause it is this one piece bootyconstructionthey don't necessarily give the tightestfit around the front of the angle hereso they've got a fair amount of supportin them not the most amount of supportbut definitely more than something thantheinfinity tour give where it's a flyknitso you've got a little bit of structureon the front of the shoe herebut you do kind of have these gaps downthe sides thereso you know they're not necessarily theclosest fitting shoeup the top but they do feel really closeat the front but they're not the closestat the back soit's kind of a bit of a mismatch inregards to how these fit and feel onfeetnow with this upper because it has gotthat overlay material on italthough the mesh material is nice andflexibleit wasn't the most breathable i've gotto admit i wore these on one of thehottest days of the year so far and myfeet werepretty baked in there so again if you'relooking for the most breathable pair ofgolf shoesthese probably aren't going to be themlet's move on and talk about how theyperformed out on the golf course and howthey fit my feetwalking the full 18 holes and i played afew rounds in these shoesand the first thing that i've got to sayis that they have quite a bit of astrange fit becausealthough i mentioned earlier that theupper feels quite close to your foot inthese shoesthey don't necessarily lock down allthat well um even over the driving rangewhen i used them i didn't noticethere's quite a bit of movement isuppose in the sides of these shoes forsome reason i definitely have foundthat my foot was moving about a littlebit kind of in this toe box and the topof the kind of i suppose the edges ofthe ball on my foot there and in thehillthere's quite a lot of heel slip inthese shoes um so although it looks likethere's a fairly decent amount ofpadding in these shoesdoesn't feel that it's doing aparticularly good job of really lockingdown my heel and keeping it in placewhen i originally got these shoes i gotthem in a nine which is true to size formebut i also got them in a nine and a halfas well because i knew from the trainersthat they were going to have this kindof tighter fitbut the nine and a half really slippedtoo much i couldn't wear them at allthat was far too bigum so i stuck with the nine which fitsme lengthwise in the showbut there's still quite a bit ofmovement and slippage in the hill areaso just something to be aware of if youwant that really kind of locked downfootand making sure that your foot is notgoing to move whatsoever in these shoesthese aren't really performing to thatkind of abilitythere's definitely a little bit ofmovement in these shoes out on thecourse i've got to say that these didfeelreally really comfortable that hill areathere with a massive air bubble is niceand comfortable and nice and soft out onthe coursebut actually i was really surprised withthe midsole foamso you can see here that you've only gotit kind of half the way along the shoeboth on the lateral and the medial sidesit goes half the way alongand nike aren't saying that this isanything special in particulari know on their trainer versions theyuse a react foam for these shoesum not for the originals i've got to besaid but for the newer versions they'vegot a react version this is just anormal phone nike have not said whattype it isbut it was really quite soft underfoot iwas really impressed with it sowalking the course over 18 holes veryvery comfortable shoes indeed i wasreally really impressed and i reallyenjoyed wearing themwith this huge air bubble at the rear iwas kind of concerned that i was goingto feel that i was kind of walking onhigh heels a little bitwouldn't be the first time i've donethat but that's for another video and soi was paying close attention to how thatfeltout on the course during my golf swingand i got to say they did feel maybe alittle bit higher at the hillbut not massively to the point that iwas really concerned or the point theyaffected my golf swingso it didn't really kind of play on mymind wasn't a huge concern to me reallyso i don't think anyone should reallyworry about how high these shoes are atthe heelnext up i wanted to talk about the gripof these shoes andnike are using an updated version oftheir integrated traction so on some oftheir trainer style golf shoes they'veused the same grip on the bottomregardless of the shoebut with these ones this is a new stylegrip that's had to be changedto accommodate this massive air bubbleat the rear so in the middle here youcan see that nike are using thesepimpled sections but then on the outsideof the shoeyou've got these edged rows going alongand i've got to say that actually i wasquite impressed with the performance ofthese shoes i use them on really quite adry dayi've used them on the range and i'veused them on a normal day with a bit ofdew on the groundand i got to say that they held upreally well everywhere i use them so fari wouldn't necessarily use these on thewettest of wet days but that's probablymy personal preference i will alwayschoose spikesover a spiked shoe if it's really wetand muddyor really damp out on the coast but forthe majority of times these performedreally really well for me i didn't sliponce in these shoesand i've got to say as well that whatreally did impress me is the way that itgripped in the rotation of my showout on the course uh during my golfswing so i think that's down to the factthat these are quitepointy in regards to the edges of thetraction pattern here on the shoe whichreally allows you to kind of gripand dig into the tuff uh so for aspotless shoei was actually quite impressed withthese and i don't think you shouldreally haveany major issues when out in the golfcourse for these now i did just want tohighlight a couple other points that inoticed about these shoesand the first one was in regards to howyou keep them cleanbecause the upper did do quite a goodjob when i actually cleaned themof wiping down pretty easy so althoughthis upper isit's not wet uh it's not quite creamit's somewhere in between the two butit's a very light upperand actually you can see here that theydid wipe down pretty cleanand easy they did pick up quite a lot ofdirt thoughwhen just wearing them on a bone dry ofcourse uh the dustand the dirt really did just kind ofstick to these shoes like a magnetespecially with this air bubble herethat did look quite dirty pretty quicklygiven that is just clear and see-throughso something just to be aware ofand also you can see here actually andthis is a little bit gross but i'm goingto show you anywaythat there is quite a bit of dirt andgrime on this tonguearea and that didn't really want to comeoff when i gave it a quick wipeover so i'm going to give that a bitmore of a deep clean so againjust something to be aware of that'sjust using these shoes for a couple ofroundsas well as over on the driving range acouple of times as well and the dirt andgrime is just starting to kind of creepon the top of the shoe thereso something to be aware of with thiscolorway so in conclusion with theseshoes i would say that nike have done areally good job ofreconstructing the 270 and making themspecific for golfthere are some things that are a littlebit you know unique to these shoes in away that they fitthey do feel very close to your foothere on the upperthey don't necessarily run small i don'tthink you need to buy bigger in theseshoesbut that's just the design of the upperbutthey do then feel a little bit loose inthe hill area as well so it's a littlebit strange theyfeel tight at the front but a little bitloose at the rearso are these shoes worth 130 poundswell it kind of depends i think how muchyou really like the air max 270they're not necessarily the best golfshoes out on the marketso if you really like the silhouette ofthe 270i would say that these are going toperform pretty much well enough for mostpeople out thereand so you're going to have a pair ofgold shoes that you really like the lookofthat you're going to be able to use outin the course and that are totallywaterproofas well which is always a really reallybig benefitare these the best golf shoes out thereat the moment possibly not i don't thinksoin that 130 price range i'd probablyrecommend some other shoesthat maybe fit a little bit better andgive me a better lock down fit in theheelbut if you really like the look of themwhich i quite do they're growing on meandi do like the fact that i can easilywear these off of the courseand then wear them out to golf as wellso that is a real big benefit of theseshoesthen you know they're definitely worthconsidering so i really hope you enjoyedthis video today so hit that like buttonif you didand make sure you go subscribe to mychannel so you can keep up

hey guysjanik here for cinecom.net and welcomeback to another copycatfriday and this week we are tackling thenew advert from knightor nike a week agonike released a you can't stop us advertand it tookevery social media by storm and ofcourse this is no surpriseas the ad is super good in meaning andexecution throughout the 90 secondadvert an athlete on one half of thescreenmirrors another one on the opposite sidemove for move as if they are one singlepersonthis represents the whole message behindthe advert we are never alone and that'sour strengthnow when seeing this i was honestlyblown away with the sinking and thematching ofall the clips nike i tipped my head toyouand that's why we had no other choice wehad to make this videoso enough yapping and let's startrecreating the first thing we now needis footage of athletesand a lot of it out of my research ifound out that nike had4 thousand hours of footage which theyreduced to 1 minute and 30 secondsnow a wild guess i don't think thatanybody here has4 thousand hours of sport footage justlaying aroundor do you that's why you have twooptionsgo out and shoot some sports yourself oruse stock lipsor maybe even mix things up and use themboth it doesn't really matter theprinciple stays the samenow we are going to start by using stockclips from our beloved sponsorstoryblocks videobut how do you start what's the rightfootagewell the first thing i did was look fora certain sportso on storyblocks video i startedlooking for running athletes and ofcourse i paid attention to a few thingsthe first is the resolution a higherresolution gives us more space to workwith in post-productionso i made use of the 4k search option ofstoryblocks videonow i started with running athletes butyou can really use whatever sport youwantwithin your search try to find two shotswith the same camera anglelike these two shots right here afrontal anglethat way we can match them easily andthis is why story blocks video isperfect for this effect they have a tonof sport stock clips you can usefrom basketball to football to balletyou will definitely findsomething you need on storyblocks videoand with only one single prize per yearyou can download as much as you want somaybeyou can have 4 thousand hours of sportfootage laying aroundwho knows for more information go to thefirst link in the descriptionbelow okay you find the footage you wantnowlet's kick off premiere pro here we cantake our two shots and place them in thetimelinenow if for example you didn't find two4k stock clipsbut only one then you best lay the 4kclip on topthis we are doing so that we can stillscale up or down without seeing theedges of the clipor losing quality then when in placeit's time to sync themso lower the opacity of the upper clipto around 50then let's look for a point to sink onthis can be something obvious like afoot hitting the ground or a certainmotionbut for us the foot will be the easiestso on the lower clip we looked for apoint where the foot is on the groundand trimmed the beginning of this clipto this point then do the same for theupper clip and we can already lay thembothin sync for the beginning anyways notevery runner has the same speedthat's why we also need to timer map theslowest runner because it's easier tospeed up your clip than to slow it downand make it choppybut before we can time remap we firstwant to get the positionand scale right so that the timer mapwill be easier now enable the animationfor bothposition and scale then adjust the upperclip to match the lower clipwe matched the face and the feet of thetwo runners and adjusted the positionand scale for the entire length of thetwo clipsmatching the top clip to the lower oneand with these adjustments you willalready sync up the tworunners next up is making the sink evenmore perfect withtime remapping so create a timeremapping keyframe on every foot hittingthe groundthen increase the speed a little bitbetween the keyframes to sync everyfootstep from both clipsand normally you now have two runnersrunning at the same speedthen it's time to create a split screenand we are doing this with a simple cropeffectjust select the top clip and right clickon it choose nest and on this nestedsequence we are going to add the cropeffectin the effects control panel set yourright crop to 50and boom we have a split screen andthat's the main principle for thiseffect butyou also have variations like you cansee right here where one athlete movesfrom one side to the other with acertain motionand from the split screen the secondathlete comes in with the same motionon the exact moment the first athletedisappears creating a smooth transitionbetween the twoathleteswhat a sentence but how can you do thatwellquite simple first look for stockfootage where the athletes have the samemotion like the rotation motion fromthis dancer and the snowboarder againplace them above each other in yourtimeline then look for the point wherethe dancer is nearing the middle of thescreen on this point the snowboarderalso needs to appearso with the position property place thesnowboarder in the right placethen enable the animations for theposition and go further in time untilthe dancer is completely goneon this moment the snowboarder needs tobe completely in the shot so animate theposition to do thisof course create your split screen likebefore and that's really it guysnow it's time for yannick fun factfountain first of all i like to mentionthat ever since i was a young boyi'm a huge fan of the nike advertsespecially the football themed onesthey were like short movies and a joy towatchback in the days but enough beingnostalgiclet's sum up some facts did you knowthat the founder of nikephil knight didn't really like the namenikehe opted for the name dimension 6 buteventually nike the greek goddess ofvictorymade the cut and another thing that philknight didn't like was the logohowever like you can guess they stillwent for the check marks wish logoand paid a hefty fee of 35 dollars foriti don't want to be that graphic designerand that was it for today guysthank you so much for watching thank youstoryblocks videofor the support and like

"I remember the first ad campaign for theair mix you just had the picture of theshoe and it's light coming through itand then I found wow there's a storybehind this emotional connection is likesuper important because it's like thestorytelling young PG sign if you lookat the air max as a line and not look atthe machines and look at them aspersonalities you'll see such a varietygoing onit speaks to people in so many differentways air max is the greatest meter linein history it became a cultural iconwithout an ambassador for a shoe to lastthis long it just has to look right feelright when you put it on what happenedwhen they put full air across the bottomof a shoe that was mind-blowing whenyou're bringing out a new air max noone's certain if it's gonna work[Music][Applause][Music]and I can have the most driven people inthe world these athletes that havechanged the game all these artists justthis hotbed of this inspirationcreativity it gives you new perspectiveson innovation the idea that you'repushing forward experimenting withpossibilities it's something that Ithink you're obligated to do is heremasters ladder so the brief was reallyto imagine what the future of airmax butspecifically that Air Max 90 could bethat became the big insight around ARX2090 as a team we thought it to recraftceramics nighty as a starting prone tocreate a 2090 it was our responsibilityto rework on this shoe just to paytribute of the past but a lot of sneakerhead loves issue and sometimes it's justthat I don't change anythingit's one of our most iconic of all thefranchiseyou never can touch an icon it's likeyou drive a car from the 60s and youwill rebuild the car nowadays it'llnever be the same that sort of tensioncomes from an older generation holdingon to something that's near and dear tothemoh geez historians have such a tangiblerelationship with that moment with theshoe that they can't get over that thisnew generation is changing it modifyingit I mean the tray is oh there's a lotof old people there are these youngpeople don't know anything they wentaround for a first time roundthere are some guys of a certain age whodon't validate that a kid can likesomething just because he likes it butmy thing is well how does it keep goingif the kid doesn't get told a story forhim to be attached to it we talked abouthanding things down when we weredesigning a new airmax we're making forthis new generation so they have theirown thing to stand with but they canlook back in the past and celebrate thatas well that's the goal for the 2090 thevisible air all started in 1978aeronautical engineer by name of FrankRudi came to fill night with this ideaof a cushioning system and it's almostweightless but it wasn't until 1987where everything changedwith their max1 the potential of whatrunning footwear could be changed thegame I fell in love with airmax ones assoon as they happen the air bubbles whatthe hell is this what the hell are theseyou can look through that shoe you couldsee the air just the red blue of course- should I get red should I get blue youwanted both you could kind of see thebeginning of what Nike was gonna becomethis innovation house was making theimpossible possible and tinkerer I thinkwas the person I set it off TinkerHatfield he's the goat Tinker Hatfieldis the sleeker Oracle the god of shoedesign tinker was in Paris and soughtour buildings he figured out how to getthat look in that idea inside of a shoebecause you have to know there was errorwhen sneakers before that there wereairships they were Air Force but theyjust said airyeah but why not just show it you knowit's not a bad idea to let peopleactually see what an air bag looks likeas a matter of fact I've got a drawinghere that actually shows what a whatshoe could look like with a visiblewindow and he'll when the idea ofexposing air started getting around atNike people started freaking out Nikethought that tinker was out of his damnmind so then it was like a hole in theshoe it wasn't an air it wasn't a holein the shoe people were like oh it's notgonna work it's impossible because youjust couldn't understand how you weregonna wear these shoes and those bubblesweren't gonna pop there are some peopledidn't belong there people thought thiswas gonna bring down the company gingkagodvery scary posted on his laptop sayingthat's a shoe stuff what he was like -II like Tico was fighting a battle witheverybody about the shoes he embodiedthat whole rebel revolution steady theeighties worried about revolution thiscold war was happening though the wallwas coming down all the politicalupheaval and that was kind of his burstof this idea really everything's aboutto changeI was born in eastern Germany and it wasnot possible to get a cool pair shoes sothe only chance to Z that was in TVillegally for the Western TV wasforbidden because just the thing youcould see it what you good to never buyitbut after the war came down all thepeople from eastern Germany got 100darks and I took my first 100 or CHmarks and I bought my very first pair ofNikes nowadays I have about 2,000 pairsof hammocks I was fascinated about thebig bubble and never thought it beforeafter all the years it was just anamazing feeling to get Nikes finally andthen 90[Music]that was the Empire Strikes Back of theair maxes Air Max 90 almost like aschool in design we had that clinicwindow that framed that bag there'sleather and that mesh it was just fullof truth up till todayit's continued to endure because of itssimplicity has never been a blend orbleed of the midsole up into the actualshoe and it was different there wasthese hints to some of the Italiansports cars of the time aerodynamic finsthe use of infraredit wasn't regular ray and there wasn'tan influential person and athlete thatamplified the popularity of this shoe itwas just a dope shoe co-sponsorshipgotta be responsible I mean concept in apopularization ko to the cetera thesecond Watson blue juice or shoe thelast this long the corniest guy in theworld has to be able to put it on andyou can go you got the good shoes onknow if you puts on a pair Air Max 90infrared 90s he's still corny but henailed it from a lifestyle and culturalstandpoint it took on something his ownI feel like Arab max has been able tostand because of music in hip-hop andhoods everywhereI have a love affair with sneakers youknow me and sneakers go way back I amfrom the Bronx and at school Nike was astatus symbol so you came in walkingwith some airmax of course you know youfire you got the latest but I used towatch the kids on my block simplybecause they had the fire sneakers onthere the real fashion icons for me I ama DJ I am a sneaker junkie and I am noteven from Brooklyn I just am Brooklynwhen I wore em max it was definitelywhat are you doing you have tounderstand it's not like air max tookoff when they came out not in the hoodwe were still wearing basketball shoesEmmerich's started as a running shoesure he didit's just that just like anything oncethe hood gets it it turns into somethingdifferent runners all over there's a 93now there's a 95 now I need the new onethe hoods going do they look good I grewup in the coolest time 70s 80s in movinginto the 90s that was the coolest timewith cool in 1990 if I was going crazyand sneakers are part of the uniformand when you go to Europe there's MXeverywhere - you trying to figure it outyou won a half what he has and make ityour own so we claiming and we claim itwith pride MX 1 + MX 90s when that shoecame out is also around the same time Idiscovered hip-hop music the way I grewup was in a very traditional senseespecially for Asian kids like I do goodat school become a doctor become alawyer and my whole thing growing up wasgo against the grain be difficult and dowhat I love instead and maybe warningthat sneaker was one of the first stepsin that whole process we started pata VMupon the genome suite in Europe we haddifferent beds that nobody else had butI'm a DJ first from 80s till 90s up tonow so I had all these records when Ifirst saw an MX shoe was probably onsomebody's feet but when I saw it on arecord cover what are thosewhere can I get up when a subculturedecides to adopt something as their ownand that's your way to find like-mindedpeople like you're not alone we don'tearly adapt it's just typical Dutch aslike I've let's make it our own versionthen the harbor King Harbor music[Music]gabber culture goes hand in hand withhuge range like stadiums full crazy kidsgo in the heart all night and with thatstyle of house that came a uniformtracksuit with some beat double thebriefing all night you cannot go withlike wooden shoes Air Max is all aboutyou're on your feet all day long you'regoing out all night you're gonna destroythis thing but then you got to do itagain tomorrow and the next day andhow's this thing gonna hold up for thatall over the world music was evolvingbut I always go back to London that wasreally kind of kick off I was a kid togrow up listening to drama bass andgarage I was surrounded by that anybodywhen it came time to making our ownmusic we used the same platform as thembut then we had our own identity rightin the beginning I didn't have a namefor what I was doing I used to turn outto raves so I just wanted to just get onthe Mac so I can MC that's what it was abad but in other clubs you weren'tallowed in without shoes and a shirtwhere Graham came into the game was lackthe rebellious to that because bluecoming just straight off the street andthen eventually he took over the wholebuilding and then it became the biggestthing you'd find it hard to talk aboutgrime and not find a relevance to a maxI'm wearing them on my most iconic albumcover I didn't think it would start anold big movies where enough but from thearea people don't really walk around inblack suits that was one of the thingsyou people will cost you about if youdidn't have good trainers on you mightnot have all the money in the world butyou've got to rap here trainers on yoursomeoneliterally every artist would be wearing1995'syou see your favorite artist wearing apair of 95 you want to go out and buythose 95 this is a layered shoeit's like material type of material typeof material number two circular saw nowas the designer on that shoe he wasinspired a lot by the human anatomy therib cage attendants the muscles and hecould really see it this is the firsttime of airmax having that four foot airunit that was groundbreaking in itselfpeople are like well this is first a maxI think a black sole people are goinglike you don't do this like runningshoes have white midsole but heavy Nikehere in Portland OR shoes getting dirtywe're running trails then why not justmake this hill to into the design when95 first came out in London they werecalled the 110 because that's how muchthey costwhy do call one turns but they costhundred and ten pound people did thingsto get money and one the first thingthey did was buy a trainer there is ahuge sense of pride and where you'refrom on what you were so you'd alwayssee people wearing a full track suit anda pair of 90s or 95 like that was thelook and it still is it's not changed atall the 95 looks nothing like the 90every time a new staple air max comesout it's an entirely differentexperienceI am sneaking his story and I rememberas a kid me trying to find a way toraise $9.99 mom can I wash the dishesmom can I shovel snow mom can I dowhatever to get my shoes and if you takethe Air Max lineage and phases it's hardto sink a lot like one particular shoein the line that makes it more specialthan the other but it goes back to thedesign because it's unlike anythingbefore[Music]like asking me what my favorite airmaxis basically like asking me which childdo I like the mostbut the 97's oh that's good you this isthe first shoe to have a full-lengthairbag like when Christian Tresserdesigned that shoe he brought thatanother point of view to that water dropthere's something so subtle andbeautiful about that this is the classicI probably have six more pair of thisSilver Bullet Air Max 97 the same exactcolorwaywhat did you see I saw silver bulletswas huge in Japan the bullet train inTokyo this transportation system thatwas revolutionized the way people movedthis shoot began to do the same thingthe culture hadn't that nickname andit's stuck because it was the vision ofthe future 97 it's a very Italy shoewith that sense of luxury that it's theperfect balance between performance anddesign my whole career has been in themagazine

Clarice all the Fashion Weekthey don't do disability balancing newinaccessible[Music]there's an emotional attachment tosneakers and depending on where you werein life when that sneaker drop what youwere doing what music you identified atthat time that will influence yoursneaker choices when you have that cleanaesthetic that's recognizable I think itbecomes a canvas for people to kind ofput there and play on it I think as soonas all these artists started coming inthis becomes this art piece for cultureto play with and say like this is how Ido itthis is basically the genesis of myworking with sneaker brands careerwith Dizzee Rascal being given his ownpair of 90s I feel like that was likethe pinnacle of crime and Londonnow that came about it must have justdone some talking and asked me if alwaysdo it and I just said yeah obviously waslaughs massive privilege like what todecide my own train on the shoewe did four pairs and it came out and itjust blew the up for us it wasbeautiful and makes one we consider itour shoot that's are you in a phonethat's Amsterdam so there would not bean adoption see the mx1 or nocollaboration for me the Air Max is seenas revolutionary it's giving visionariesof voice and I love that I was able todesign the seeker with Nike by you andwhen given this opportunity I have newstraight from the bat that I wanted toincorporate my full-time career as amental health therapist I do therapywith kids in foster care so I'mconstantly surrounded by trauma[Music]I have sneaker decals on my office wallso it's really cool when I haveteenagers come into my office the oldMiss Liz you have some drip I havefallen in love with air max ever since Iwas a kid and the high school that Iwent to sneakers were kind of a refugefor me for me I think the most iconicsneaker that warms my heart are thelemaise claw designed by Gabrielleserrano I was born in Queens I work inthe medical field I have like youngerkids coming in and they're like oh mygod you're like the cool nurse thatwears sneakers I wanted to make it notjust a shoe about myself that's why Iended up doing all the different skintones to highlight everybody in New Yorkthe airmax even though it's meant forperformance is just taking on a wholenew evolution when you have that canvaseveryone loves it they feel connected toit the 90s was like the Golden Age ofairmaxand I think now looking back we're kindof doing let's do that again I don'tthink there's such thing as creatingicons icons just happened just like whensomebody goes I'm gonna go in the studiothat someone's gonna be a classicyou're a liar either it just happens butit doesn't happen for a sneaker tobecome an icon the people have to makeit the iconI do believe that you can take somethingiconic and make it better as long as youhave the respect for what came prior Idon't think the new generation has theirown show in that same sense that we hadour generations should encourage youngerkids to do stuff your own way we're notgrowing up in this time regardless ofwhat a designer or Nike wants to make itit's the culture that makes it what itis there's history of where airmax camefrom but it's uniquely modern anduniquely now that's what this is this isthe new generations airmax this is madefor them we kind of thought about futurecity's future of fashion reducingdistractions and this idea of simplicitynot like just doing a mash-up of tissueit what we did to create the new Air Max90 it's very sensitive balance betweenhaving something bow down on somethingfamiliar[Music]you have this duality between expressionon experience this is why people relateto the shoe this is what make Air Maxand Max we're celebrating anniversariesfor shoes that when they were makingthem they thought they were gonna goaway oh yeahthe only reason why these things keepgoing is because the story keeps gettingtold from a older guy to a younger guyto a younger guy to a younger guy and itstill looks perfect Anisa media Amexalready unites people that's why we'rehere that's why we have thisconversation you will find a 17 year oldkid rocking a regular MS and that's ashoe that came out in the 90s for it toresonate

I think a lot of runners are discouragedthat shoes have become such a huge focusin a sport that used to be seen as soelemental it was just about yourtraining and your fitness and you on theopen road and this shoe technologycontroversy has changed all that peoplewonder where was this regulation earlierthey feel like not all brands were giventhe same chance to develop thistechnology that may be the spirit of therules was largely ignored for severalyears on January 31st world athleticstrack and field's world governing bodyreleased new regulations about shoesworn in elite marathon competition inthe wake of a record-breaking times fromrunners wearing Nikes vapor fly shoesthe regulations set specific limitsabout the height and composition ofdistance running shoes soles can be nothicker than 40 millimeters and anyrigid plates must be in one continuousplane 2020 is an Olympic year theJanuary ruling means athletes can wearprototypes in February's Olympic Trialsbut any new shoes must be available atretail by April 30th if they're to beworn at the Tokyo Olympics so how areshoe companies scrambling to match Nikesvapor fly technology well I think thefirst objection by critics was thetiming because world athletics you knowhad received complaints about these Nikeshoes or concerns at least for at leastthe past two or three years and yet ittook until January for them to take anyreally specific action so I thinkcompeting brands were saying hey this isan Olympic year this is incrediblyimportant for not only development ofour technology but also for ourcompetitors who have their highestprofile competition the US is almostunique in the world in that it holdstrials for the Olympic marathon teammost other nations hand select theirmarathoners but in the case of the USyou have to finish in the top threeamong women are men to qualify of coursethat makes it incredibly important thatyou're in shape and that you have a shoethat can beat other runners earlier thisyear the Wall Street Journal studied thevapor fly asking experts to de-sect theshoe to demonstrate what some athletesand critics say give the shoes anadvantagesecond you can see the full-lengthcarbon-fiber plate and this carbon-fiberplateadds a lot of stiffness and stability tothe shoe as well it's a race to thespring deadline for brands to releaseshoes if they haven't already butcontain a carbon plate and comply withthe New World Athletics regulationswhile hookah onaona is Shu comparable tothe vapor fly technology has been outsince May 2019 we'll see debuts frombrands like saucony with their endorphinPro would be released globally on April15th Brookes will publicly launchedtheir Hyperion elite shoe on February29thbut announced five days before theOlympic Trials that some of their

fly on February 29thit does have a thicker sole than thevapor fly but the brand has said it willcomply with the new regulationsprivately especially to one another somerunners who run on competing shoes haveexpressed concern about whether theirswill match up not only with the currentNikes but these yet unseen new Nikes Ithink some athletes and brands feel thatNike has too much influence in the sportit's the leading brand in performancerunning shoes and sponsors many manyathletes sponsors USA Track & Field thepresident of world athletics is alongtime former Nike sponsored athletecompetitors worry that maybe thatrelationship is a little bit too closewith the body that's supposed to beregulating it when asked about thebody's independence from Nike WorldAthletics responded in a statement weneed to balance what is currently in themarket at an elite level and draw a lineby prohibiting shoes that may go furtherthan what is currently on the marketuntil further research is undertaken andthat no shoe company was directlyinvolved in shaping the regulations anike spokesperson said in a statement tothe Wall Street Journal we believe thenew world athletics rules will stifleinnovation over the longterm ultimately impacting athletesconsumers and fans Brook said in acomment to the Wall Street Journalgenerally we would spend more timebetween prototype and bringing issue tomarket but the recent W a ruling pushedus to reassess or go to market strategyone of the reasons why these questionsabout shoes are so important is becauserunning isn't only for elites last yearin the u.s. about 50 million people wentrunning at least once and if there's ashoe that someone thinks is going tomake them run a half marathon or a 10kfaster they might be very interested inbuying it so this is not

on post notifications and let'shead on out to really hope youunderstand Hydra dipping and sneakercustomization I want to introduce you tothe man a team with new life kicks he'sbeen in a sneaker game for over a decadeand he will be walking us through how tohydro dip shoes the right way before weget into it Akeem explains why sneakercustomization is on the rise when itcomes a customization people want to geta custom that is unlike anything anybodyelse to see so we we create one of onecustomers you know you want to stand outyou don't want to blend in with everyoneelse so you come to us and then we canbring you bring the light almost anyyeah so the purpose of this video is tohydrate definition right yeah it is alsosomething that's very unique and rarethe way that we're going to show it sowhat I want to do now is just head onout to the car and actually get thiswhole thing startedto start the hydrogen process werecommend you head over to a hardwarestore like Lowe's to pick up thematerials to accomplish this you'regonna need a 10 gallon clear bucketmasking tape clear coat and an exactoknife the hydro dip activator isactually the only thing we have to buyonline and we'll link it in thedescription of the video this is thehydrographic film that we're going to beused to dip the Air Force one this is adesign inspired by takashi i'm sure tothe man who actually came up yet madethis vector for us yet in collaborationfor what sure we use we're going to beusing the classic Air Force one they'remade that's fresh so then I'm just goingto dip the whole shoe or what do youknow you're not going to dip the wholeshoe you know create a design you knowsomething that will resemble an officialNike mmm-hmm you know anything you wantI can actually steal our ideas give uscredit for what he got ideas of how youcan actually dipper Air Force One sothis is like way different because a lotof the Hydra dip hyper dipping videosout there just they just dump the entireshoe yeah I've never actually seensomething to do something custom likewhat Kings about to do yeah you guys aregonna want to check this outso the first step to doing any custom isprepping the shoe taking out the lacesis included and prepping but you want toprep removing the entire factoryfinished from the leather just to makesure your paint or whatever rapid youhave can adhere to the surface you canaccomplish this task by actually usingacetone and a cotton rag alright movingon to the next step you're gonna needsandpaper prefer 1500 grit is very verysmoothwe're gonna use the sandpaper to add alittle bit of texture so that the filmwill stick a little bit better and bevery careful not to sand too much orelse you could damage the leather on theshoe the second step is called a maskingprocess now look in the masking processit's essentially going to tape off theareas that you do not want thehydrographic design to print onalright masking is also important tokeep the shoe from getting wet by usinga plastic bag you can ensure that thedesign only goes in the areas that youwant as well as prevent any water fromgoing inside this will allow you totransition into these next steps moreefficiently and get custom shoes out alot quickerstep three is preparing the tank alrightguys this is gonna be important the nextstep in the process is to actually getyour water filled up in the tank thatyou purchased now it's gonna beimportant that you guys use warm wateras the hydrographic activator that weuse requires water that is around 86degrees Fahrenheit now this is gonna beimportant guys because if you get thewater too hot it's not gonna adherecorrectly and if you get it too cold thesame thing happens so you want to makesure that your temperatures are nice andmore importantly you're also gonna wantto make sure that you test the filmbefore applying it to the final productI recommend you guys use some productlaying around the house that allows youto test it and dip the process andensure that it's actually gonna stick toit before you startdumping you the shoes that you spent somuch time preparing make sure that youguys use clean water as often as you canbetween each dip this is amazing thankyou chose one into just making sure thatwe're gonna get this design on thischecker and on this shoe that design onjust the backside so I'm excited to sayso now we're in now we're about to dipget ready to dip and we want to makesure that we size our fill to correlatewhat the size of the panel that you'llbe dipping we won't need this entirefilm so we're gonna cut it in half justto make sure we don't waste it tape thefilm firmly to something that you don'twant the exacto knife to damage like thelid that came from this tank tape eachside of the film and cut it accordinglynow a bonus tip here is to just kind ofleave a little slit in between two orthree sides of the tape which will allowthe film to expand and better adhere toyour product[Music]after letting the film hydrate for about60 seconds apply the activator you willsee the film turn into a glassyappearance and now comes the fun partnow you're gonna want to make sure thatyou take your time here guys don't rushthis process and you're gonna want toaim it correctly to Center yourplacement of the design now a key hereis to just make sure you look at whichdirection the design is going so youdon't get the smiley faces or a certaindesign upside down or going in the wrongdirection patience is important hereguys think about it test it on anotherproduct before you dip the final designI want to make sure that you remove themasking quickly being careful not to getany of the excess hydrographic design ona part of the shoe that you don't wantby removing the bag carefully it alsoprevents you from spilling liquid intothe shoe which will delay your hydrodipping process now you want to let theshoe dry between each dip all right it'sgonna be important that you do this inorder to let the shoe fully heal beforedunking it into water againnow this last part is completelyoptional but it will allow you to trulycreate a one-of-a-kind some tips herewhen it comes to the using the Nike AirForce one consider painting the air logoperhaps the actual font and even thestitching this will allow you tocoordinate with the customization thatyou did through the hydrogen engine allright you guys now the final step ofthis process is to protect the designusing the clear coat you're gonna evenlyspray it onto all the areas that you putyour art all right this is gonna ensurethat your art stays for life and yourcustomers are happy[Music]check out the level of details that cameinto this shoe guys with hydro dippinanything is possible and of course byadding a little bit of your artistictouch to those details you can

hey everyone kevin here from golf guyreviews and today we're going to becomparing to night despite shows we'regoing to be taking a look at the rush ag tour which currently retailed on thenight website for around a hundredpounds although i did buy this pair onoffer for around sixty five pounds andwe're going to be comparing that againstthe night react vapor tube currentlyretailing on the night website for 130pounds and again i bolt these ondiscounts for ninety five pounds so ifyou liked this video please hit thatlike button feel free to subscribe to mychannel where we'll be looking at otherreviews of golf shoes tech and clothingand I thought what we'd do today is takea look at the features of both theseshoes see what you get for your moneyand see which one we think is best sofirstly looking at the upper of the rusha this is a synthetic leather design andit's a pretty soft leatheryou know this software out there butultimately this is it's not a top-endshows not a top-of-the-range show andit's kind of tackling that mid-rangemarket price point so it's quite a nicesoft leather upperyou've got a decent amount of padding onthe inside there with the sock liner andyou've got a tongue which goes right theway through down to the bottom and againis relatively padded but it's it's apretty bog-standard designed to behonest and the roster is copying youknow the really popular rush a styletrainer to be honest is that popularI've got two pairs at the moment and Ireally really like the rush a supercomfortable trainer and so I can seeexactly why they've decided to copytheir style it's quite a plain lookingshoe so if you're not looking foranything too fancy or too flashy thenthis could certainly be the show for younow if you compare that to the Naikreact vapor - then this got little bitmore going on for it as you can seethere's a little bit more detailing onthe shoe it's also a synthetic leatherupper now both are waterproof but if youhave a look on the upper of the react -you can actually seethere's a little bit of Italian on theupper there and that's designed to addsome additional comfort some softnessit's actually some technology thatthey've used in a lot of their footballboots as well to give the players betterfilm or with the ball and it is aslightly softer leather in my opinionit's a bit of a softer feel to it withthe upper as well with the react whatyou're getting is you're getting theFlyknit technology as well so on theRoche the laces are just kind of gothrough this little bit of lever here oneach side and they secure the the shoethat way it gives fire security acrossthe shoe there's nothing too specialgoing on there compare that with the flyin it which you know nike using a lot oftheir technology on their shoes rightacross the different ranges the fly andit means that when you tie up theshoelaces they're going through theselittle corner hooped wire pieces ratherthan going straight into the lever andthose are connected further in the shoeso when you do up the show it's pullingthe shoe right across the foot from alower position and it's really helpingto lock that shoe your foot in the shoenice and tight with the vapor too aswell you see that you've got a splittongue design as well whereas the rush Ijust had a pretty traditional standardsolid tongue and a Gorham it I'd neverhad a shoe with a split tongue beforeand actually it really did make quite abit of difference I felt that the tonguewhen I did the laces up my son - itlocked down around my foot and was a lotmore comfortable to be honest it's onlya very thin tongue it's just a littlebit of material really so there's notmuch of it compared to the Roche whenyou've got a little bit more padding alittle bit more traditional but I didn'tfind that that affected the overallcomfort of the shoe and so I quite likedthe split tongue design looking at thesoleplate of both shoes you can see herethat they are absolutely identicalthere's going to be no difference interms of the amount of traction thesetwo shoes are giving youwhen it comes to style of the two showsit kind of depends what look you prefergoing forward really as I said beforewhen we looked at the uppers the rush ais a much more planar design show it'snot very fleshy at all so if that's thetype of goal shoe than you that you wantthen you've still it still looks like areally good show I still really like thedesign of it but it's certainly a littlebit more plainer when you compare thatwith the vapor to then this is certainlya little bit more fleshy but still it'snot too trainer like it's I'd say it'sin between a trainer style show and aand a traditional level of golf shoe butof course it's quite aggressively styledyou've got the contrasting color waysthere you've got the textured materialon the top the laces you can't quite seein the video here but the laces are andskinnier and just a slightly differentstyle look compared to their to thebigger traditional rushes and what Ithink happens here with with the withthe texturing as well is that it makesthe react vapor to does look a littlebit skinnier to me when you look down onit but ultimately it just depends whatyou're looking for in the style of agolf shoe when it comes to looking atthe mid souls of these two shoes that'swhere you get a significant differencestarting with the Roche this uses thetraditional Luna non midsole foam whichis absolutely a very very comfortablemid foam they've been using that stylemid foam for several years and it is avery nice all day comfortable midsoleyou get a lot of good cushioning from ityou get a lot of nice support from itand it works really well in a golf shoeso as I say I've got a couple of pairsof trainers of them with these and theyare very very nice with the trains towalk around in all day for I know thatI'm going to go for a long walk for outthe day I have not got an issuewearing the rush age whatsoever so ifsticking them in a golf shoe certainlymakes sense and it gives you a lot ofcushioning and a lot of support thatsaid when you then compare it to thereact foam midsole and you can see thenicelittle bit of detailing in the back ofthe shoe there when you compare it tothe react midsole you then notice thatactually the react is the newertechnology and the react is Mike'sequivalent or rival to the adidas boosttechnology and so by what I mean by thatis that it's really going for a softcushioned fill with a good amount ofbounce back and responsiveness so youfeel that when you're kind of puttingenergy into the midsole and you'reyou're pushing off the ground then it'sactually returning quite a bit of thatenergy to you as well when you get agood bounce and fill so it's thecombination of the soft comfort mixedwith the bounce fill and to be honestthis is where one of the key differencesI can see with it with a pricedifference so you don't forget you'vegot the rush a standard price 100 poundscompared to the vapor vapor to standardprice 130 pounds and the difference inthe midsole alone is enough for me tojustify that price difference I when Ifirst tried these because I'm a I'm abig fan of the booster and the comfortit provides and this certainly isdefinitely right up there as well samewith the pew Marie Premier ignite foamthat is a very comfortable foamthis is equally up there and is anextremely comfortable golf shoe so ifyou're looking for a shoe for thecomfort that you can walk all down thecourse and both of them are going toprovide that comfort but it depends whatyou're looking for in the show really ifyou're looking for something that's alittle bit less expensive stillcomfortable but not quite as not quiteas responsive in the sole then the Rocheis a great shoe if you're looking to forme personally go for that ultimatecomfort that you can provide in a shoethen the react is the more comfortableand soft the feeling of the two phoneslooking at the rush A's and feeling therush A's on they still feel like acomfortable golf shoe and I think it'sreally really good value for money thatyou get with these a good waterproofsynthetic leather based show that's niceand comfortable to vote and looks goodbut when you do compare that side byside to the additional comfort thatyou're getting from the vapor toes I'vegot a mitt that my foot does feel morecomfortable in these shoes it does feela little bit more locked down andsecured around the the top of the footarea and actually does feel to be alittle bit more room in the toe box ofthe vapor tote when you compare that tothe Roche the Roche if it was a littlebit more restricted I think that'sprobably because the leather is just alittle bit more tougher in there so I'msure it's gonna break down after timebut initially straight out of the box ifI had to pick a pair to play with todayI'd be picking the vapor toes so whichis the better show the russet or G orthe react vapor toe well I think it allcomes down to budget really if you areon a strict budget and are looking toget a mid range spite night golf shoethat's gonna be nice and comfortable andwaterproof and it's gonna see youthrough for the next couple of yearsthen the rush a is a good place to lookit is it is a good looking shoe as I sayit's more reserved in the styling but itis nice and comfortable and that midsolein there is nice and soft and grip wiseyou're gonna get exactly the samestability and grip from the Roche asyou're going to get from the vapor tubebut in my opinion the react to is thebetter show there's a lot moretechnology going in to this one whetherit's the different upper of thesynthetic leather with the texture andit's got that softer more secure feel tome you've got the split tongue foradditional lockdown and comfortyou've got the fly wire which reallyhelps with the stability and lockingdown your foot inside the show and thenyou've got the react foam which reallyreally is comfortable and you can whenyou compare the toe you can feel thedifference that the react is the morecomfortable soft or fun so if you canjustify it the additional 30 pound thenI would definitely recommend the insidebecause personally I think it's a betterlooking shoe it's got a little bit morestyle to it and it is the morecomfortable shoe so ultimately thatextra 30 pound actually goes quite along way but hey let me know what youthink let me

this is Paul Rodriguez Peapod was one ofthe first skaters to be sponsored byNike for years it was taboo for skatersto support Nike because it was theopposite of what skateboarding culturestood forif you skated in the early 2000s thenyou probably remember being shocked andmaybe even downright angry when Nike SBATS started popping up in skateboardmags like Thrasher and Transworldhow did this happen why is thisrecognized as such a big cultural shiftby both the sneaker world and skateboardculture the truth is that during thisera skateboarding culture was hugelyimpacting sneaker sales skateboardingwas finally reaching the mainstreamafter decades of being an undergroundoutcast at subculture during this boomiconic brands like DC Shoes etniesAmerica ES and Osiris began to make aname for themselves in the industry Nikewanted a piece of the pie and wasdesperately trying to secure a footholdwithin the lucrative skateboardingindustry their first attempt at crackingthe industry was a massive failure Nikesigned a young bam margera as its soleteam skater and launched a collection ofpoorly designed skate shoes that notonly resembled your mom's Skechers buthad three of the worst names Nike hasever cursed its Footwear with the airchode the air snack and the Shemp I meanlook at these it's no wonder skatersdidn't embrace Nikes first effortsskateboarding culture was unfortunatelymisunderstood by Nike they're soullesscorporate image failed to resonate withthe skateboard community after multipleattempts and a failed TV ad campaign itwas becoming clear that it wasn't goingto be easy for Nike Desert its dominancein the rapidly growing skate industry in2001 Nike hired sandy Bo Decker's had apranky skateboarding division Bo Deckerwould prove crucial to the success ofNike SB he understood that Nike in facthad already been part of skateboardingheritage turns out handfuls skaters fromlate 80s and early 90s were alreadyskating in classic Nike silhouettes proskateboarders like Lance mountain andthe Bones Brigade his family woreBlazers and everyone from mark Gonzalezto Steve Caballero skated in Jordan oncethe reason skaters wore nike shoes backthen was because Nike basketballsneakers were cheaper to buy than skateshoes they were super comfortabledurable and most importantly had greatboard feel something Nike would improveon in the years to comeNike task boat Decker was rebuildingtheir crumbling skateboard division boatDecker's solution was to do the exactopposite of what Beckydone for so many years instead ofadopting the usual Nike model of tryingto completely own the market fauxDecker's approach was to be a grassrootsoperation Nikes new skate shoe line wasto avoid mass production genericreleases and would not distribute tocorporate sports stories that skatersdidn't care about but what about a solidproduct that skaters would get behindwhat she would Nike be selling this iswhere sandy beau Decker's genius came tosurface he argued that there was noreason to design a new shoe becauseinfluential skaters had already wornNikes in the past the design was alreadythere in the future line in thecompany's history Bo Decker convincedNike to overhaul to eighties basketballcollege sneaker the Nike Dunk firstreleased in 1985 the Nike Dunk wasdesigned by legendary Nike designerPeter Moore the design closely resembledthe Air Jordan one a lot of people don'tknow this but both the Jordan one andthe Nike Dunk were introduced the sameyear and designed by the same team itmakes sense that skaters used to Jordanwon in the late 80s because the tech wasbasically the same as modern dunks wellmate the Nike Dunk design so special wasnot its tactic but it's endlesscolorwaysthe shoe was actually brought to themarket as a college basketball

their own unique store here'ssome of our all-time favorites they allhad their own nicknames comment below ifyou owned any of these the list includestwo Heineken the Bison the Sharks theTiffany's camp

atleast in the short run in the days afterthe at launched the company's onlinesales jumped more than 25 percent beforecoming back down to earththat's because advocates of Kapernickand Nikes messagebanded together to buy more Nike gearsupporters like Nick Cannon use theirmoney and platform to purchase Nike gearand give it to the homeless this isn'tthe first time Nike made a socialstatement in an ad the brand hashistorically taken a stand on issues andit's almost always resulted in a rise insales in July 1988 it released its firstjust do it campaign when it

profits almost tripledfrom the year before and then were upanother 139 percent by 1990 in 1993 thecompany aired a commercial starringCharles Barkley this sparked controversyabout whether celebrities should be heldat a higher standard and contrast itwith the squeaky clean image of Nikesbiggest star Michael Jordan that fiscalyear revenue increased by fifteen pointfour percent in August 1995

[Music]what's going on YouTube should boy freshbe back at it coming off the bench likeIguodala as you can see today noJohnny's no pop VIX over there somewhereworking on a video today what we'regonna be doing is cleaning these Nikeepic reacts as you guys know or may notknow and I could just put these outintroduce them I think it was late lastyear earlier this year in my opinionit's their response to the ultra boostpretty dopes you still don't own a pairthough but we're gonna try to cleanthese up Johnny was wearing these as youcan see trash them looks like somespilled soda and some other stuff onthere but nothing rejuvenator can'thandle so let's get into it guys so toclean these bad boys today what we'regoing to be doing it uses massiveinators three brush laundry kits so inthe kit as you already know you may notknow I don't know why I keep saying thattoday in the kit you're gonna get yourfour ounce solution your laundry bag -such as few trees I know I only got oneout here but we're only cleaning oneshoe so that's all we need you're gonnaget your all-purpose brush your softbristle brush and your stiff bristlebrush so let's get into this cleaningguys first thing you're gonna want to doadjust your shoot trees to size peoplealways ask about this how do we knowwhat size or what hole to go on we kindof cheat measure it beforehand just soit's perfect every take but for this oneit's a size 11 I think I'm gonna cleanthe left shoe todayso hop this in as you can see put theshoe tree in there so you can do extrapressure on this toe box especially withthe fly knit material we're gonna setthis guy to the side next thing we'regonna do unlace these bad boys I knowthat's a Johnny and pops his favoritestep because they always seem to forgetto do itfinally got these laces out like I saidI don't own a pair of these but thelacing system nike put on the Tingsdifficult as hell just put these lacesout so now that we got the laces outnext step put them to the side whatwe're gonna do take our solution ourbowl of water so take our solutioncouple of squirts into the bowl so wegot the solution squirted into the bowlwe're going to start with our softbristle brush because this is a planetmaterial you want to dip your brush intoyour solution just start attacking allthese stains up here as you can see I'mnot sure what it was that Johnny spilledin this it looks like there's some dirtoil something definitely some soda onthe midsole and outsole because it'spretty sticky[Music]although we put the shoe tree in anotherthing I like to do and I think mostpeople that I find when they're cleaningwill stick their hand in there and theother thing that that does is for areaslike this when I'm putting pressure yourhand is there with the firm the firmnessof your hand that I should say willallow you to put more pressure on someof these upper areas so now that we'vefinished up with our soft bristle brushshake off any liquid off of that I'mgonna switch to our all-purpose this isthe new all-purpose that comes in ourlaundry kits the bristles are softer onthis one than our old all-purpose sowith this I'm gonna clean up themissile's a little bit but not too muchthat's what I'm gonna save this stiffbristle brush for but I'm gonna hit upthough the uppers again because there'sa few small areas especially with thiscounter right here the hill counterthat's on here's a little extra dirtysmall hit it up with the all-purpose solet's just get into that[Music]so with the all-purpose the bristles arestill a little bit stiffer than the thanthe soft bristle brush so you do want tobe careful as you can see I'm not doinga lot of pressure when I'm brushing I'mjust lightly going over it you just wantto be careful not to snag your materialnot saying that it will but it couldpotentially do that you just want to usesome caution when brushing with theall-purpose on any knitted material sonow that I finished up attacking thosetougher stains we're gonna wrap it upwith the all-purpose you could clean themidsole with this but since I'm going toclean the outsole also we're gonna moveon to the stiff bristle brush so nowthat we got our stiff bristle brushlet's attack these missiles and outsolesthis is a foam entire foam midsole Iknow it's supposed to be softer thanlunar but it doesn't seem to be too badyou do want to be careful when usingstiff bristle brushes if it has anypaint or it's a painted midsole you wantto exercise caution or not even do it atall just for sake of not damaging thepaint job we have had some instances ofthe paint messing up so that's just acautionary tale be careful with thestiff bristle when doing this[Music]so now that we attack these missiles I'mgonna give them a quick pat-down just tokind of see our progress see if we needto hit it up againshouldn't take one of our microfibertowels these things do have someinteresting grooves in them because ofthe pattern of that foam so you may haveto go at it a second time just becausethose grooves might trap some dirt inthere so as you can see the mid cellsdid clean up pretty nice but like I saidbecause of these grooves in the foam Iam gonna want to hit it again plus I gotto continue cleaning these outsole likeI said the foam is unique in it that hasthese grooves and that's something thatgives it its little characteristics butyeah let's finish up with these Altosand wrap up this cleaning throw theminto the laundry after that and then weshould be good to goso finishing up with these outsoles I'dbe lying if I said this wasn't a pain toclean because of all these grooves butwe do it for you guysso now that we got this also cleaned upwhat I like to do is lather up since weare throwing this in the laundry islather up this upper again hit it hit ithit it once over just because I like theshoe all suds dub when I throw it in thebag so I'm gonna do that really quickthen we're gonna throw these in thelaundry and finish up these cleaningit's not that my trusty cameraman Ronaldover there reminded me we've gotta cleanthese laces don't want to forget thatyou just want to dip them in your bowlof solution just like scrub off some ofthat excess rub your hands together withthem in there get these cleaned upreally quickly throw them in your bagand then let's head to the laundry sonow before we throw our shoes in thereyou want to make sure you secure the bagcool so you want to turn on your washerwe got this little trusty bad boy inhere in our restroom so turn it on grabsome of your Sneaker laundry detergentthis bottle seen better days but we'realmost towards the end of it so we'renot going to worry about that loosenyour cap squeeze in about an ounce youcan see it fills up there boom so youtake your solution or your detergentsorrypour it on your shoe there close thewasher up and since we are only doingone shoe you want to just make sure itis a small load normal cycle cold waterno hot water guys always use coal so wegot everything set up just hit up our Gobutton and let's get out of here let thewasher do its thing alright guys we'reback after putting the shoes into thewash as you can see they came out prettygood the only thing I will say is insome of these deep grooves on theoutsole sure you guys can get a look atthat I'm sure and get some good b-rolljust because of like I said when I wascleaning it all these grooves that areactually in this foam I knew it wasgoing to be a painso there is so a little bit of dirt inthese finer grooves right here butnothing really to worry about unless youwere like trying to resell them orsomething it's not that big of a dealbut everything else did get reallyas you can see the flying it turned outreally good so we're gonna lace these upwrap this up and let you guys get it onyour way alright guys so we went aheadand laced these up just like withunlacing them this thing was a pain tolace up it took a lot longer than itshould have we finally got it done so asyou guys can see that came out reallynice what we did on these today we useour three brush sneaker laundry kitclean the uppers with the soft brushwent back over it again with the mediumbristle brush or the all-purpose brush Ishould say tackle the outsoles and themid soles with that stiff bristle brushas you can see used it to get in thosegrooves one thing I did do that wedidn't show on camera because I reallywas trying to get that outsole reallyclean but was to use our brass bristlebrush this is really good for gettinginto some of those grooves you canactually really see it pretty good inthis translucent area of the midsole areof the outsole I should say if you lookon the Dirty Pair you can't even tellthat that part was translucent so it dida really good job with that we threwthem in our laundry with our laundry

Philip today is something he was apretty specialyeah it's not every day you get a boxlike this off-white for Nike NikeMercurial Vapor um I think we kind ofall know what's inside of this box Idon't actuallyit's a Virgo a blow I know but I do notknow how it looked you know you know youhaven't seen before no um you can kindof you get a gist we sell with this uheven this box right here which is prettynice is it what it is oh we got the logouh kind of guess that's logo oh that'sfor me let's go up there alright let'sdo it alrightoh that is over this mess that is somebright color does that say bag on thisoneHey it says boo back Oh actually does itdoes say boo back oh and of course itsays off-white and all that jazz andinside you do get different phrases whoathat says shoelaces obviously just so weknow what it is so we know what it isthank you burgle a blow so don't mix upthe shoelaces with the boot bag anddon't put the boot bag on their bootswhen you play I mean you can kind of seewhere we're going hereum for the height beats out there Ithink you already know what's insideboom boom we all have like this thepaper here but it's even says pay for acolor got everything with a paper withthe paper the vapor with the paper andlet's just say that these are like veryvery very very special um obviously forevery off-white our virgle Apple fan outthere this must be a wet dream and Igotta say to some extent this is also awet dream why because we have the tinyNike logo yes I'd know where it belongsso it kind of looks a little bit like aV but to you which I like a lot so uh sowhat what do we think I mean it it doeslook a bit like it yes I was just aboutto say that's then as you as youmentioned I really like this the smallswoosh yes it's rather than a big oneits undertow beautiful and to be honestI think they don't look half bad when Iwhen I saw the pictures for the firsttime I like nah kidding me uh but Iactually like them in handit actually appeals to me especiallywith this this white line here yeaharound the trim oh sorryaround the soleplate and it goes all theway around even underneath yes what'sreally really cool and for once insteadof having this very Cromieyeah finish up to the to the soleplate Ilike how it's just are not almosttranslucent plastic while in the colorone color it looks pretty big of courseit says then on the bottom ECC Flyknitand fast AF because it is a part of thefast day of night um we got the the kindof customary off-white Nike MercurialVapor and even if you're a high P's thenyou know about off y-you know whatthey're all about all the yes in it hereon the it says engineered to the exactspecification of championship athletesthat's beautiful too on the back righthere mmmengineered full speed limited edition itsays instead of vapor 360 pretty niceand then of course um the creme de lacreme we got thoughall of them on this side um and apartfrom that that's basically all theystoodI mean virgle he um yeah it's a verysimplistic way of looking at things butI think it's kind of special becausethere's not a lot of people that does itthis way no it's very it's veryin-your-face right yes because they'rebasically pointing out stuff that youalready know let you know this is a bootit's me in that regard I know a lot ofpeople really like Varga well why not Ithink some of his stuff is really cooltoo but you can't deny that he's hisstyle is very at least this style I'dlike it's done with with Nike with thehold the 10 pack they made it's it'svery like one concept with the wholequotation marks and then stating theobviousokay nice isn't it this is shoe lacesetc etc I think some people will bebummed that we don't have to hold ourread price that kind of thing but to behonest I think it would look a littlebit ridiculous confidence so that's kindof what it but you actually haven'tmentioned the - you know dots that wehave what what are those all about thiskiss I think it makes like it stands outa bit and it makes them look a littlebit like clown shoes I'm just gonna sayyeah you know don't kill me out therebut I'm just gonna say you you know youyou say you say the clown angle but I'mjust gonna go out and say that the bluedot doesn't like for me doesn't makesense it's not that in look it's notthat it looks bad it's just that likeokay I see it kind of a pattern herewith the the kind of wall vault yellowand the orange the white line and thenthe blue just pops out of nowhere it I Iwould totally totally we we do it is I'mnot saying it's bad I'm not saying it isbad it's like it's a little bit weird itis now the funny thing and i which ithink is a bit of a shaming it was thatbecause habló decided to have the thelocal thing on the side here now you canactually see how Nike had to UM tobasically toe little further up so onthe normal vapor we have this gradualshift in the Nike skin coding where itstarts to be by being fullon the bottom and then it gradually goesup the side so we can basically get amore should we say flexible image on theupper but you can basically see how theyhad to just give it our full coating allthe way up so they could write on theNike skin because they can't write on itit is very very important informationthat you get right here it's not quitetrademark for Nikeyes Nike Mercurial Vapor and the logo is69 million but that's just a start andand you can you can argue for andagainst I think I thought these arerelatively cool if we could kind of losethe blue dot and don't you know somepeople might call it you know sacrilegethen I want to lose the blue dot forwhatever but I think this really doesdoes the trick for me yeahI really love it but I really think it'sa shame that if they really had to coatit I'm REE uh in order to put the theswoosh on like just I'm gonna I'm gonnabe go ahead and be honest here as welllike if you think that someone will buythis and be like hey I'm gonna rock thison the pitch because I'm off-white fanWow and then and then complain about thefact that it's coated here yeah and Idon't think that you should get thevirtual habló I think you should go justhead and get these instead yeah becauseobviously these are virtual ah flows offwhite Nike collaboration and they arespecial they're not made to you know fora you know rainy March afternoon ohthey're not no no no but but like thefunny thing is I I gotta be honest Ithink these look alright but I have notreally warmed yet to the to the toeflush this is how I think this workshould look on the new vapor and theSuperfly that's how it is another thingpeople need to know is that this isgonna come out as a vapor 12 but on thepitch it's actually gonna be worn by aCanadian poppy who will wear a super flyversion of it so is something like thatyeah it's gonna be very interesting tosee he's obviously gonna wear it in theFrench Cup final so so pretty cool thatthey keep it with a French player inPali III like that and honestly I gottasay though that I think to go withorange and white is a more of akiller than to go with orange and kindof tinted chrome it looks it lookspretty cool right it's like even thoughit's a very hyped up colorway it's verylike in-your-face but I gotta say thatthe white toning it down makes it evenmore I I would agree with you now ofcourse this is gonna be hyped to themoon and back and that's just how it iswith with burgle Apple collaborationyeah the funny thing about virgle a blowthat we talked about just before we gotstarted was that uh it was announced abig night um that he is taking over thethe creative director position and formenswearnow the funny thing is that and yeswe're gonna talk about the box later toto show that but the funny thing is thatthat the position as creative directorspeaking of suitable boxes yes um it wasuh it was left vacant by this time Ilike in jobs yeah who basically Istepped down as the creative directorfor Louboutin in January and now they'vereleased this now is it just me or is ittoo big of a coincidence the night youhappen to collaborate with the twopeople stepping you know one stepping upone stepping down from I think it's afunny coincidenceit is it is even even though Virgilhablo did a lot of things before thiscollaboration we as Nike yes you knowit's too funny not to be but that'sthat's it just it just occurred to methat it was kind of funny I gotta say interms of this I do appreciate thesoleplate here with his name slapped allover it with his name's o Jones comeJonesoh just though that we know he's just agreat just in case you didn't knowanyways I like the the virgle a blowmade for twelve a lot more I'm gonna goahead and say this that the orange hereno pun intended but I see a pattern herewith thesorry I just had to sew on but what I dosee a pattern and I I do think out ofthese three I gotta say that the outlawsare the better look at once of all thethree I would and it's only because ofthe the the small swoosh yes and thetone down white and the same color yeson the soleplate yes so we could losethem like the blue bubble of shenanigansand the hole I'd mid all over the placedoes not really feeling that you knowbut but you know the white and the samecolor soleplate is is exactly what alsoappeals to me so good job burgle a blockum very good job actually again boncalawhatever they they say gets them face Ithink that's a good word for an inFrench I'm not sure Philipany last words on these becauseobviously people are gonna freak outabout it yeah let's just talk about thisall right this is what I really want toappreciate go ahead and preciate thatbecause that was that's pretty coolshe's you know all the details on theboxIza is pretty wicked a lot of bunny earsdid it in the paper even the paper we'veliked all the customary stuff it's it'sjust it's cool and that's the thing withwith Virgil Apple that he just makesthings that are he follows through hemakes cool things and and yeah he foundhis niche okay and he now is slappinghis trademark on different things andhe's no not doing you know any differenthere and I gotta say though I you as yousaid a lot of people will get hypedabout this boot and it's rocket Reesewith good reason but I'm not I'll reallylike the boot but I'm not on board withthe overhype no no well we you and meagree on that I'm not I'm not happyabout this because it's very gulliblei'm actually hyped about it because it'sbetter looking than I thought it wouldbe but because we both had likeexpectations of it yesover those words I think we should go weshould kind of put it out to the massesout there what do you think about thenew Nike Mercurial Vapor 12x Virgo addlow or whatever they decide to call itin the endoh do you think it's a hit just likethe the other the 10 Susan made

[Music]today we're gonna review the NikeMercurial Superfly 6 to see if it's anybetter then the Superfly 5 and to reallytest the new boot abroad jobs who asksimpressively wide foot to really pushthe Superflyto its absolute limits exactly butunfortunately J might we can make anepic review here so why don't we bothlay down and dream of someplace verynice cool[Applause]I chose to dream myself away to Monacoto look at what is essentially the vapor12 with a dynamic fit collar it featuresthe same 360 degree one-piece file itupper and I solve that split into aninner chasse and two outs old pots thatmeans that in general the fit is a lotlike on the vapor 12 it's tight andfollows your fit very closely but in aless restrictive and more rounded waythan on the Superfly 5 then there's adynamic fit collar that gives you a verycompressed sensation around the anklethat almost tricks your brain intothinking it is more like of a naturalextension of your foot and it's a lotless chunky and more nice I think thatunder Superfly 5 and with a slightlylong and low toe box the Superfly 6feels like a knitted aerodynamic speechinstant for your foot that really filledme with[Music][Applause]what I really like though is our thefree upper works extremely well with theanatomical soul play that almost sucksyour foot in to give you an extremelylock-in fit and combining that with avery aggressive feeling because of thetraction you get a pretty potentsensation under your foot in that regardit's my job to watch enough that you'redoing here it's a man it's more like asun is shining I want to join okay it'smy dream inceptionhe also came to Monaco to enjoy thesuperfly cigs in a beautiful settingbecause with the new gradual likeencoding the booth made promises ofbeing able to stretch enough to feed mywife and it did it is of course verytight and close to the food takes alittle bit more braking time compared tothe flight in ultra but you do noticehow there's more space here on top ofthe boots for us white hooded peoplewhere the fly need is more exposed andthat makes a huge differenceagain it's tied it snug it's close toyour food but it's not uncomfortable andif you go to the sides have a little bitof patience for the breaking period youcan fit the Superfly no matter the shapeof your foot[Music]the touch is also interesting as you getsuch a thin upper package it means tofeel a lot closer to the ball and get agood amount of grip so it doesn't feellike the ball is slipping away andbecause there's no foam on the uppershooting feels close and bear food likeno matter where on the food you hit it[Music]sadly dreams don't last and back in graycold Denmark we decided to give theSuperfly a reality check and look atwhat it could do better now the firstthing I noticed is that just like on thevapor 12 the upper is a little bit toostiff for my liking when you take it outof the box it's softer than on the vaporjust a little bit but still a bit for meI would actually agree and I was also alittle bit disappointed in the breakingtime this board requires especiallycoming from the fly at Ultra we saw lastyear which was just pure butter straightout of the box in general just will beused to from flying ebooks and anotherthing I noticed was that just like onthe vapor as well I got this bit ofweird like chafing on top of the softbecause of the tape I got a blister andI'm not used to that in 2018 but thenJohn says there's also the matter thatyou repeat itthere's the durability so far we haven'thad any problems but since the soleplateis actually underneath the upper wedon't know how well it's gonna last inthe long run but again so far so good[Music]these are only small issues in a premiumbooth only and what made me think themost is the fact that the superfly inthe vapor and now so close to each otherthe Superfly 6 is an absolutelybrilliant poof it's really no denying itin fact it's so good that if it wasn'tfor the vapor 12 this would easily beone of my favorite piece out there butthey super fly to me has always beenabout this incredibly extraordinary thiswild array giuse lee innovative and Ihaven't made my mind up yet maybe thatspeaks for itself but it's the Superflysix really Superfly enough to be a superfly or should it just up in the vapor 12D F instead pocket philosophy aside bothJoe and myself could agree on the factthat the Superfly 6 these are very goodbecause not only is the best performingsuper fly ever made it's also a superfly that can be worn and enjoyed by morepeople with different food shapesexactly and you and me curious obviouslyI never thought I would see the day meneither but seriously man let's agree onnever ever ever ever meeting in dreamsagain yeah I agree okay but guys what doyou think about the Superfly 6 youshould let us know

following in the footsteps of thehypervenom won the hypervenom to haslandedit's made for the agile deadly playerand after hours and hours of testingdribble shots and few misses it's timefor my review so let's get down to thenitty gritty apart from the fact thatwell obviously Nike really changedsomething and introduced a dynamic fitcolor compared to the hypervenom onewe've also seen a lot of other changeson the hypervenom - with brand new upperFlywire being introduced to hypervenomand actually also Nike reworking theirsoleplate a little bit even though itdoesn't look like it but more on thatlatermy first reaction when I put on thehypervenom was okay this is a brand newsensation obviously the dynamic thecolor makes a huge impact but it wasvery different to the hypervenom oneon my feet the - and - feels quite a lotdifferent from the hypervenom one mostlybecause of the upper material actuallythe upper construction is a bit morestiff and rigid it doesn't move as muchwith the foot as on the hypervenom onewith just the Nike skin mesh also nicelyreintroduced these here flex grooves youcan see for added flexibility to theupper and also a bit more friction butit's not perfect and still when you bendthe foot the upper has some a bit morestiff movements than I'd likeso it is a bit different from thehypervenom one to be honestso fly wire is a really really bigchange on the hypervenom to because ittakes the food in a complete differentdirection than the hypervenom onebasically the concept is this littlethread going from the base of thesoleplate to the lace hole so when youpull the laces tight it really locksyour foot on the plate to give you themost efficient energy return and youactually feel that from the moment youput the food on the dynamic fit color isa pretty big introduction on thehypervenom soon but fortunately it's notjust another material or magista becauseit's actually bonded with the syntheticupper fortunately though it's in apretty seamless way so you don't reallyfeel the transition from the syntheticto the Flyknit material but what Nikedid with the hypervenom 2 was that theyoffset this seam so you don't reallyfeel any pressure when you move yourjoints or your ankle and that takes awaythe problems with blisters as well whichI'm a big big fan of this is how Nikesyou make it for the future the generalfit is affected by the stiffer upper itis made over the same last you can stillsee it is pretty wide but because theupper doesn't stretch as much as on thehypervenom one you might have a problemif you have a really wide foot size-wiseI'd say go true to size I went with myusual size UK six you're 40 and it wasdead-on perfectperformance has improved a lot in thehypervenom - compared to the firstgeneration because you do get a muchmore locked-in fit it really eliminatesthe annoying thing about the hypervenomone with sliding around in your bootbecause you didn't really have that lockdown and when it comes to protectionalso you do get a thicker upper to takeaway some of this thing when you get atitle the changes on the soleplateactually has a really huge impact on howthe blue feels because although it mightseem like not much has happened with thesame stock configuration Nike actuallywent in and softened up therenylon glass compound a bit to make itmore flexible and you really feel thatwhen you move around because especiallythe forefoot it's a lot more flexibleand moves more naturally with your foottwisting and turning though in thehypervenom - is pretty awesome becauseyou get the conical stats that reallyhelp you move smoothly through theground so I don't really have anyremarks there it does a pretty good jobwith a good energy transfer thanks tothe torsion bar here and also Nike addedthis kind of grippy mat a finish whereyou really feel the friction when youdribble it's not as you know surgicallyprecise as the hypervenom one but it isstill pretty nice to dribble withstriking the ball is actually one of myfavorite areas in the hypervenom tobecause of the performance mesh so themesh when you hit the ball reallycompresses and takes away a lot of thisthing you get the toe box is low andpointy there's no issue in getting underthe ball and I'm all flexing to losethat this way yes the hypervenom to tome is an improvement it's actually acompletely different there's not muchleft of the hypervenom one with thatsaid it is an improvement performancewise it's much much better keeping yourfoot on the plate giving you a moreflexible sole plate and actually givingyou a more seamless fit with the dynamicbit color and the heel is sensational itis gonna scare off some people with themore stiff upper give it a bit of timeget used to the more tight fit and isactually going to perform really wellbut yes it is an improvement after allon the hypervenom one so nike spenttheir time well hypervenom - might be adifferent animal from the hypervenom onebut it's really responsive has a greatstrike zone with a good free feelingheel is it perfect no but what he wantsto do it does damn well and if you likethat strapped in ready to rock feel thehypervenom to is right up there amongthe best it's not all the match,22,UCWxgNxxTeDfWh05MIZGhnGQ,Phidippides TV,5,4,0,27,No Tags,Nike Vomero 10 Review,l5Zjr2FW0Q4,11493

to see how farthis brand has come over the past 20yearsi would say recently over the past 10years there has been a lot more hypewith people collecting it especiallywith sneaker heads and collectingdifferent itemsdifferent trinkets this is somethingthat's dope for an in-home displaya lot of people get the bigger size onesand when i talk about different sizeones there are different tiers to sizingyou have itty bitty ones and then youhave the large ones all the way up toone thousand percentthe prices are literally gonna rangefrom a couple bucks to literally acouple hundred to a couple thousanddollarsfor the retail value and then the resalecan obviously go up depending on thecollaboration and whatever it may be sowhen we see a collaboration with thisit's kind of dope to see them takingtheir collaboration from their toy andactually doing it with the sneaker andthen now releasing a sneaker and a toythat comes with the shoei was not able to get the bear brickthat comes with these in particular buthere's a photo so you can see what itlooks like this is not the firstcollaboration with nike and bear brickwe have seen other ones over the pastcouple years2017 2018 those also came with bearbreaks and special boxes differentsituations like thatsometimes they have the regular releaseand then special pack with the box andall the different trinkets and all thestuff that goes with it typically thatcauses the sneaker to be worth a littlebit more because you get the entire setplus the toy and everything that comeswith it i'm ready to show you guys ashoe enough talking let's get into itstarting with the outsole you have aall-gray outsole something that i'm veryhappy about because typically when youwear a shoe with a white outsole it getsdirty immediately and you can reallytell the difference when the shoe isdirty or notso for this having the gray outsoledefinitely a bonus working our way up tothe midsole we have all white midsolewith a black stitchall the way around the shoe and then tothe upper i think this is a very dopehitall pony hair around the entire uppermainly black and then you have a bearbreak at sign here on the back of theheel and you have a gray pony hair witha gray stitch here with the nike on theback around the heel as wellanother dope touch is the at bear bricksign here on the tongueinstead of the nike sb you still haveyour fat nike sbtongue right here and one thing that ireally really love i don't know aboutyou but personally when they have aleather sock liner and a shoeit just feels a little bit morecomfortable a little bit more premiumand i like it just a little bit more sowhen i look at the white leather sockliner right hereoh my god these shoes come equipped withtwo different laces you have your fatblack laces and you have your fat whitelacesthe white laces have a silver tip onthem the black laces have a gold tip onthem here's a look at the bottom of theinsole and here's a look at the top ofthe insolei love the detailing it's almost kind ofgot like that laser vibe like when theydo it on the jordans this one is justactually bare bricks everywhere in alight gray print and then you have yournike sb with your bear brick logo rightunderneath that20 20 medicom toy yeah these are fireso there isn't too too much to go overwhen it comes to the color and thedetails and all those things becauseit's pretty simple right you got yourblack pony hair all over the shoe andthen you got your subtle hits around itbut honestly the simplicity behind thissneakeris so clean to me i like dark shoes ilike black shoesfor something like this to come out i'mso happy with it and honestly i thinkthis shoe is undervaluedyes it's worth around 500 550 bucksright now but i think over timethis could go back up in value it washidden for 800 to a thousand dollarsoriginally when it first came out but ithink this shoe just fellunder the radar a lot of people didn'treally realize it was coming out there'sbeen so many sb's so many dunks jordansall these different releases stuffreleasing on random days these didn'tcome out on the weekend eitherso because of that some people weren'teven paying attention we had kobe weekso many other factorsand i get it there's just a lot of shoescoming out but me personally i thinkthat these flew under the radar and ithink if you can get them for 500 orunder right now i think that's a greatdealjust because i think they will go up invalue drop a comment down below and letme know what you think about the pricedo you think these are going to go up doyou think they're going to go down doyou think they're going to see it how doyou feel about this shoe i know some ofthe other bear brick sb's weren't asdope as these or maybe they were to youbut i think to me they weren'ti think this one is very very clean ithink this is probably the bestcollaboration that they have done so farbut again let me know what you thinkabout that in the comment section butbecause of those and the value that theyholdpeople might think that these might notgo as high but i think once peoplerealize likeyo this shoe was hard to get it is okaykind of dope once i see it in persongive it a little bit of time next thingyou know800 900 000 shoe so i went to instagramlike i always do if you haven't alreadyfollow me on igon there i like to post different thingson my story that i don't post hereget some

so there's been a lot of hype aroundnike dunks and a lot of people beenhitting me up asking me the questiondj what's the difference between dunksand jordan ones they look the same so intoday's video i'm gonna be breaking downthe differences between these two shoesthat way you guys have a betterunderstanding and knowing what kind ofproduct you're purchasingwhat's up with you guys how you doinghow you been if you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit that subscribe button don't forgetto hit the bell notificationfor every time i upload a new video andmake sure you hit that like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm ohso much so first things first if youknow anything about this channel wealways have to talk about the history ofa sneaker first that way you have abackground understanding of the shoe andwhere it came from why the hype is heretodayand why every sneaker head should alwaysrespect classic og models something likethe nike dunk or the air jordan onenow i know every original sneaker isn'tdope to every single person but at theend of the day if it wasn't for thehomage of the sneakers from the pastwe would never have the hype of thesneakers for the current sowith that being said let's go ahead andget into it back in 1985nike decided to release a promotionalpack of the nike dunk highbe true to your school series and had abunch of different series with collegeteamsthat they sponsored that they hadwearing their sneakers and their colorsthis pair in particular that we'relooking at today is a retro from 2016paying homage to the og colorway fromback in the day also in 1985 we had aperson named michael jordan i'm not sureif you heard of him beforebut he came out with his own sneaker andlooked pretty similar to the nike duckhigh but they made a couple tweaks andthey made it his version and i'm tellingyou right now there are actually a lotof differences between these two shoesi know if you look at it like this youmay say oh yeah they look the same butonce you start really breaking it downyou're gonna notice there's a lot ofdifferences between these two sneakersso looking at this photo right herethese are some original colorways thatreleased in 1985that came out to the public that peoplehad an opportunity to purchaseand look at the differences between thecolorways the color blocking in adifferent style between the twobut i'm telling you right now there's alot more to it than just thatas you guys know there are a bunch ofdifferent versions of the nike dunk highyou have sb you got lunars you got somany different versions of this sneakerand then when it comes to the jordan 1high it's the same situation there are abunch of different variations of thesebut i wanted to make sure that i broughtyou two versions right here that aresimilar to the og styles that are retroin today's marketand that are obviously on everybody'smust-have list so let's go ahead and getstarted breaking down the shoe okay sofirst things first let's take a look atthe box this is the classic og style forthe air jordan one boxthis is a special edition box that's alittle bit different than we wouldtypically getso i made sure that i brought an orangebox that you would actually get on mostnike dunk highs and that's the one thatyou would see right here this all orangebox right here was more of a premiumversion from this special pack that theydid in 2016but typically what you're going to seefor a nike dunk high is going to be thisall red box with the big white brandingon the topnow looking at the outsoles as you seeright here they look very very similarbut when you see these closer up detailshots you can see there is a differencein the patterns and then the width ofthe sneakerthe nike dunk high is a little bit moreof a narrow sneakerand the air jordan 1 has a wider outsoleto it and againas you see in the images right herethere's a big difference when you lookat the stars at the toe of the foot orthe definition here in the center of thefoot now working our way up to themidsoleit's the same thing yes some people maysay it looks the samebut when you see these side by side youcan see there is a clear difference theair jordan one has a classic texturedpattern right under the stitch line hereon the midsoleand then if you look at the dunk highyou can see there's a couple lines thatgo up and down verticallybut there's no real pattern to it andit's pretty smooth now taking it to theupperone thing that i can say on this pair inparticulari do low-key like the leather on thenike dunk highjust a little bit more than this stormblue pair right herenow i know this was a premium versionthat they did release so i have to dotake that with a grain of saltbut when it comes to quality for thedollar i would say these are worth itjust a little bit more to mejust because this sneaker right here 120bucksthis one right here 160 bucks typicallyon a nike dunk high retail is going tobe anywhere from 100 to 130 bucksand if you're thinking about a jordan 1you're thinking about anywhere from 160to 175on the retail price for that so ifyou're looking at price alonethis one is going to be a bang for thebuck in that aspect so i'm going topoint out three similarities for youguys and then maybe about five or sixdifferences between the two shoesand then everything else should bepretty obvious for you that i don'treally need to say which i'll show youin photosas well so let's go ahead and get intothat so one thing that is pretty similarbutslightly different is the tongue if youlook at the nike with the swooshbranding here on the nike dunk highyou can see that it is very similar tothe og high air jordan onebut that air jordan 1 always comes withthe nike with the air underneath it soif you're ever confused on thedifference between the twoalways look for the nike air on thetongue compared to just the nike withthe swoosh but other aspects like thetongue material or the sock liner aroundit they look pretty similarit's kind of hard for somebody to knowthe difference between the two on thatpartanother thing that is pretty similar onthese two sneakers as well is theperforated dots on the toe of the shoeand i know it's kind of hard for peopleto tell but the dots on the nike dunkhigh are just a little bit smaller thanyou would see on the air jordan one toeanother thing that looks very verysimilar to a lot of people is where theswoosh is placed at on the sneakerit is in the center of the foot righthere but the placement on the backaround the heelis just a little bit higher on the nikedunk and a little bit lower towards themiddle of the heelon the jordan one now let's get into themajor differences because as you can seei'm showing you a lot of similaritiesbut they are still just a little bitdifferent from each other one thing thati have always noticed on air jordan onesis when you look at the three holes hereat the eyelets at the front of the toeas you can see the leather flap overlapsthat seam line that you see right hereand it's stitched right above itbut when you look at the nike dunk asyou can see it's separated into twopiecesand the whole lining that comes aroundit is above that lineso for me that's always a big giveawaywhen i'm looking at the two shoes and isee the toe of the foot i personallylike the way they cut the air jordan 1just a little bit morelet me know what you think down below inthe comment section another hugegiveaway for air jordan 1 highs is youhave the wings logo right here that saysair jordanand then on the nike dunk there'snothing at all so that's a big giveawayas welljust looking at the side part around theankle you can clearly tell thedifference between the twonow looking at the cuts of the materialsand how they went about stitching theside of the footis another big thing on the back end ofthe air jordan 1 you basically have acap that goes around the back of thefoot then you have your nike swoosh thatcomes around of thatand then you have your white leatherthat goes on that side and then you haveyour imitated strap line that runsaround the top of that with a littlecollar above thatand i can't forget to mention the littlesquare patch that brings it all togetherhere in the center of the foot sobasically you got six different piecesall coming together right here to createthe heel of the air jordan one now whenyou look at the heel and the back endand the flaps of the nike dunk there'sone thing that's a biggiveaway like i just said the flaps soas you can see right hereyou can unlace this area and it'llactually come apartand you can have the flaps hanging outto the side typically on mostog high air jordan ones they don't havethe flaps i understand we haveoff-white we have zoom we have othercolorways that do have the flaps ajkoeverything like that for the most partwe have typicallythis style right here and i know we'regonna have people in the comment sectionbut dj you forgot the rookie of theyearsand the i get it bro i get it i know youknow a thing or two about shoes tooi understand we're just trying to helpeverybody here so anyways back to theheelif you look at the heel on the back ofthe nike dunk right here you can seethere's four stitch lines above the heelcapand then there's a stitch line down thecenter of the heel cap looking like twodifferent piecescompared to the one that you would seehere on the jordan one and then rightabove that you have a little squarepatch that's kind of similar to thejordan onebut this is actually a looped piece ofleather that's almost like a pull tabbut it's not and i'm not exactly surewhat exactly you would use that forbecause you can't even fit your fingerin itand i don't know like what the purposefully is of that so somebody pleaseexplain that for me down below in thecomment section becausetrue functionality i would never usethat loophole for anythingmaybe people tie their shoelaces all theway through the back of it or somethingi don't know drop a comment down belowso for the last thing that really standsout to meas you see on the side panel of the airjordan 1 there's like a vtyped or l-type shape whatever you wantto call it but it's a stitch line thatgoes here and downand if you look at the nike dunk there'sno stitch line right there sotypically when i look at air jordan onesi'm looking at the toe caplooking at the perforated dots theeyelets right here around the front thenike air on the tongue the wings logothe capon the back or that stitch line on theside of the foot to tell the differencesbetween the nike dunk highso i also went to instagram and i askedthe people which one do you guys likemoredo you like jordan 1 or do you like thenike dunk high and this one was a majorlandslide asexpected 95 chose the air jordan 15 chose the nike dunk high when it comesto price resale hypeexclusivity all that different stuffdopeness collaborations materialswhatever it isboth of these sneakers are classics irespectboth shoes me personally i have more airjordan ones in my collection because ido like air jordan ones morebut at the same time i always got tomake sure i got some dunks in mycollection as wellbecause i mean bruh like you gotta haveit but another example when it comes tothatis price right when you look atsomething like the air jordan one storein bluetwo similar colorways right here thissneaker is going for like 800 to athousand dollarswhen you look at something like thekentucky dunk high this sneaker is goingfor like 500 or 600 bucksso don't get me wrong you bought thisshoe for 110120 whatever it may be you still got abig profitsame with this shoe you bought it for170 bucks you got a big profitso that right there proves to me alonehow dope both sneakers aresome people can pick sides and chooseand other people can be on both sidesand just loveand appreciate both sneakers i'm thetype of one that's still in the middlewhen it comes to that aspect i wouldchoose jordan ones over dunks if i couldonly have one but luckily i'm fortunateenough to be able to have both of mycollections so at the end of the day ihope this video was extremely helpfuland helped you just get a betterunderstandingon the two shoes the differences and thesimilarities and why people may thinkthey are the same or whatever may bewhich one do you guys like more thestorm blue or the kentuckyi'm excited to hear what you guys haveto say i got a couple more comparisontype videos like this for you guys witha lot of sneakers that are very similarbut different at the same timeand a lot of people get misconceptionsof the two so i'm always happy andexcited to help you guys understand thedifferences between sneakers becauseevery day we have new people

hi Jacoba unisport webtv and on today's menu wehave our review of the Nike magistaOprah now the magista has build up quitesome busts so today we're going to takea look at if this boot can actuallyrevolutionize the way we think aboutfootball boots so if you want to knowhow the magista Oprah performs on thepitch then you better stay right herewith me so let's look at the fit side ofthe boot because herenow you wanted to eliminate all thedistractions on the magista and sointroduced the Flyknit upper and thedynamic fit collar now because of thisnew construction some of you might beworried that the magista is tough to puton but luckily it's not as hard as itseems because basically you just gottaloosen the laces up a bit and then pullthe boot on like a regular socket andokay you got to pull a bit harder butyou get the deal and once you get theboot on you really feel that the fit issomething else now because of this reeflining material and the dynamic fitcolor you get a pretty close tight areally personal fit in the magista andit's basically like it's made to followthe shape of your foot and also nikehave applied a black inner lining whichis slightly padded so you get a verycomfortable feeling wrapping around yourfoot while also making the magista feela little bit more solid that you wouldactually think I need to boot X now theawesome thing about flying it is that itallows Nike to actually remove thetongue on the Medusa which makes theboot really hawk your foot uber tightall over basically wrapping it like asock wood and further enhancing thisfeeling are the Brio cables that go fromthe soleplate into the eye state andwhen you're pulling the laces tight youcan really feel that the beat iswrapping your foot like a sock andproviding lockdown and the cool thingwith the fact that there is laseron the magista they didn't need to bebecause the upper would still fit youwell but because of the laces you canreally pull the boot tight and adjustyourself how tight you want it to be noweven though the Brio cables work reallywell in keeping your foot on the plate Iwas looking for just a tiny bit morelockdownin the magista simply because my foottended to move just a little bit whenchanging directions with a lot of forceand I mean it's no big deal but it'sjust something I know it size wise I'dsay the magista is true to size I wasn'twith my usual size 40 and the fit ispretty much perfect both length andwidth wise but the coolest thing aboutthe magista is that the gr13 lasts thebooties bill on will accommodate both aslim and a wide foot especially becausethe fly net material will stretch to fitthe white footed playersnow the thing that really sets themagista apart from any other boot I'veever tried is the dynamic fit color andbasically it makes the magista feel morelike a part of your foot than any otherfootball boot out there but to be honestI don't think that physically it makesyour lower leg and your foot move morein unison than in say any other footpoking the thing is it feels like thatand you get that sensation mainlybecause of the closed seamless fit likethere basically are no distractionsbetween these parts of your leg and yourfoot because the magista is made to helpyou move in tight spacesit's equipped with a pee bags an islandsoleplate with mostly conical studs andalso a few bladed studs now you canactually feel that the nylon frame ispretty stiff and responsive making themagista feel like it's reacting verywell to your little bursts of speed andcombining that with the fact that nikeremoves the insole board you're reallyclose to the ground and can transferenergy from your foot to the soleplateand then ultimately the ground themagista also made me feel a bit morefree in my movements and after thinkingabout it I came to the conclusion thatit's because 19the soleplate without the mechanicalflex which basically means that my footis not forced to bend in the same areain the same way every time and when youcombine this with the stiffness and thestability from the nylon frame youactually get a very nice combinationwhere you feel you can basically burstinto any direction you want at any timegrip wise the magista just what it'ssupposed to which is help you turn ontight spaces mainly thanks to theconical studs that really give you aseamless motion through the ground whenyou're turning on the spot and I reallylike it in that aspect now as we knowmagista is made for the creativemidfielder and as a midfielder you needas much control on the ball as you canpossibly get and to do this Nike haveequip the Flyknit upper with these realcables that create this honeycomb blackpattern and that is one to give you morestability but also two to give you morefriction on the ball and we know thatmore friction needs more grip and moregrip means a bit more control but thequestion is how does it workand yeah it actually works pretty welland the touching the magista is quite aninteresting combination mostly becauseon one hand you get a pretty close tothe ball feel thanks to the thin Flyknitupper rim but then again on the otherhand it's also a bit soft and slightlypadded mostly thanks to this slightlycushioned inner lining so it's a bit ofa mix that's very very interesting nowit's not a total barefoot like feel buthaving said that you're still a lotcloser to the ball in the magista thanin other boots with similar amounts ofgripwhen it comes to shooting the magista ispretty no-nonsense there are no issuesgetting under the ball and because youhave no tongue you really get a niceclean striking surface all over theOpera but one of the best things whenstriking the ball to me is the innerlining because again it takes away a bitof this thing when you really strike theball hard and it makes it a ripepleasure because the padding is just theright combination or you can still feela lot but it doesn't hurt that muchwhen you really put your foot throughthe ball when it comes to the Briocables they're also going to give you abit of friction when you're striking theball whether you're striking it with theinside of your foot for the instep anddon't get me wrong it's not going toturn you into this world master butthere's still a nice little toolso the final verdict on the magistaobrah is that it's well it's reallyreally awesome and the fit is one of thebest I have ever tried in a footballboom similar because it fits your footso closely that is actually hard todescribe you have to try it and to putit into perspective when I went back toa conventional football team I reallymissed the closest ation off the planetand the dynamic bit color it's that goodwell what do you think about the magistaOprah and is it something for you wellleave your thoughts in the commentsection below and if you have questionswell that's the way to go swell becausethis was all I have to do for today I'llsee you later on and use the wet TVsigning off to yell so is it hard toclean the magista well for the part thathas Nike skin with a CC on it water anddirt will come right off when you wipeit with a cloth but the dynamic colorand the tongue pod is exposed the finiteis exposed so it tends to get a bit moredirty and you have to put a bit moreeffort into cleaning it off with a softbrush and the dirt is going to stay abit there so you can see it on the colorbut that's kind of the way it is I guess,22,UCcWL-dwDhzQeo4rIK1Tbc9A,SportsOnScreen,35,14,0,1129,"['Nike', 'Inc.

every 28 seconds somebody buys aLiverpool kid that makes over a millionunits a year with a collapse recentsuccess demand has almost doubled sincelast season and the homekit is now themost popular in the UK supplying theLiverpool kid is a big deal and so itwas big news when the club recentlyannounced sportswear giant Nike as thenew kid supplier starting in June 2020in this video we want to look into thedetails of the dealhow Nike outmaneuvered New Balance andwhat LeBron James Serena Williams anddreg have to do with it especially sinceits acquisition by the Fenway SportsGroup and the arrival of manager JurgenKlopp the development of Liverpool hasbeen quite impressive both present andfuture looked bright with a 2019Champions League win as the recenthighlight this makes the club a valuableasset for brands and many sponsors seekto work together with a Liverpool tosell their products and be associatedwith the club's success so when theirkid sponsorship deal with New Balancewas up for negotiation it was nosurprise that many brands bid to becomethe new kid supplier New Balance wasdelivering the Liverpool merchandisingsince 2013 and saw a continuous growthof sales driven by two consecutiveChampions League finals the company waseager to extend the seven-yearrelationship and ready to pay 45 millionpounds per year besides New Balance theLiverpool executives talked to the threebig players Adidas Puma and Nikesince adidas had quit their sponsorshipagreement with Liverpool's seven yearsearlier calling the club overpriced theywere not considered a credible optionPuma had just signed Manchester City forreported 58 million euros and thereforedidn't have the budget for a competitiveoffer so the decision was to be madebetween the current sponsor New Balanceand the market leader Nike compared tothe 45 million pounds from New BalanceNike offered significantly lessguaranteed based compensation of 30million pounds but they also offeredmore marketing and sales efforts and

every 28 seconds somebody buys aLiverpool kid that makes over a millionunits a year with a collapse recentsuccess demand has almost doubled sincelast season and the homekit is now themost popular in the UK supplying theLiverpool kid is a big deal and so itwas big news when the club recentlyannounced sportswear giant Nike as thenew kid supplier starting in June 2020in this video we want to look into thedetails of the dealhow Nike outmaneuvered New Balance andwhat LeBron James Serena Williams anddreg have to do with it especially sinceits acquisition by the Fenway SportsGroup and the arrival of manager JurgenKlopp the development of Liverpool hasbeen quite impressive both present andfuture looked bright with a 2019Champions League win as the recenthighlight this makes the club a valuableasset for brands and many sponsors seekto work together with a Liverpool tosell their products and be associatedwith the club's success so when theirkid sponsorship deal with New Balancewas up for negotiation it was nosurprise that many brands bid to becomethe new kid supplier New Balance wasdelivering the Liverpool merchandisingsince 2013 and saw a continuous growthof sales driven by two consecutiveChampions League finals the company waseager to extend the seven-yearrelationship and ready to pay 45 millionpounds per year besides New Balance theLiverpool executives talked to the threebig players Adidas Puma and Nikesince adidas had quit their sponsorshipagreement with Liverpool's seven yearsearlier calling the club overpriced theywere not considered a credible optionPuma had just signed Manchester City forreported 58 million euros and thereforedidn't have the budget for a competitiveoffer so the decision was to be madebetween the current sponsor New Balanceand the market leader Nike compared tothe 45 million pounds from New BalanceNike offered significantly lessguaranteed based compensation of 30million pounds but they also offeredmore marketing and sales efforts and topay 20% royalties of all net sales ofLiverpool merchandising the totalcompensation paid by Nike couldpotentially rise to approximately 70million pounds per year which explainsthe appeal of the Nike

so a lot of people hit me up asking methe question dj what's the differencebetween a nike duck and a nike dunk sbso today i'm going to be breaking downthe differences between these two shoesbecause i want to make sure that youhave an understandingon what shoe you're buying[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit the subscribe button hit the bellnotification for every time i upload anew videodon't forget to smash the like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm oh somuch so first things first i do want tolet you guys knowthese are not the only type of low topdunks that are made you have nike dunklow pro pro bsp co japan 6.0 there's a lot ofdifferent nike dunk lowsand i'm pretty sure there's more that ididn't list but i know these are the twomain hitterswhen it comes to people looking forsneakers and stuff that typically hitsretailsor skate shops that a lot of people arelooking to buy so i wanted to make surethat i broke these two down inparticularbecause they do have similar colorblocking obviously it's not exactly thesamebut we're not worried about colorblocking we're actually talking aboutthe cutsthe materials and the functionality ofthe two shoes and how they become sodifferent even though they may look thesame so the first thing we'll talk aboutis price the box and then we'll talkabout the shapes and molds of the shoewe'll talk about the insoles the sockliners the tongues the outsoles thelaces literallyeverything has something just a littlebit different and that's why i'm soexcited to show you these differencesso let's go ahead and get into it solooking at the box as you can see righthere for the regular nike dunk lowthis is going to be with the red box andthen the nike sbas you can see on the box it's thepurple box and it has the nike sb logoright herethe best thing about this is both ofthese are going to be around 100for retail so some people may getconfused on that aspect alonethinking hey they're both 100 buckswhat's the difference between the twoshoes so we know that there has been alot of hype around dunks because theyare very similar to air jordan onesit's always a classic model and you cannever go wrong with it especially to beable to purchase this shoe for 100 bucksand let's not even talk about resale butwe know that they're hitting right nowand it makes a lot of sense for peopleto be copping these so i definitely wantto make sure you guys know what you'regetting into so with typical fashionlike i always do with every sneakerreview we're gonna talk about theoutsole firstand as you can see right here there's ahuge difference between these outsolesone is configured for a nike sb outsoleand then your regular dunk here has aclassic og nike dunk outsole so when itcomes to skateboarding and the purposeof nike sbyou're going to want to have more gripmore traction different things like thatand this shoe is configured for thatreason so that's why you see thedifferences between this outsolethey did go with a similar vibe but asyou can see just from the lines righthere and the lines right here there's ahuge difference and that should be onebig telltale for you to understand thedifference between if it's a sb or notand if you look right here where thenike logo is you just have nikeand then if you look at the sb it saysnike sb right here that's another bigindicator to help you understand thedifference between the two now wrappingup to the midsole this is another thingthat really stands out and i don't knowif a lot of people do notice it or notbut if you look at the small lines righthere on the classic nike dunkas you can see the spacing between themright here and when we put them togetherside by sidethe lines go all the way up to the topwhere the white line is on the midsoleand if you look on the nike sb theyactually stop just shy of that line andthey all float just right underneaththatand also the spacing is a little bitdifferent right there so that's alsoanother easy way to tell the differencebetween the two shoes looking at themidsoles of the shoes they do look veryvery same to the visual eye so i can'tsay there's a huge difference betweenthoseyou got all white with the white stitchand obviously the color blocking willchange depending on the colorway of theshoe now when it comes to the cut of thesneakerit is slightly changed just a little bitas you can see this one's a lot morepuffy around the ankleand padded on the inside around the sockliner area and then obviously you have ahuge thickfat fat tongue and it says nike dunk lowpro and it's got the sv right hereand if you look on here it's just gotyour regular nike with the swooshbranding on the tongueit's thin with a mesh and then you havea thin sock liner and everything aroundherejust like a regular fit on a regularshoe so for me personally when i seesomebody walking from far far awayobviously i can't see the soul of theirsneaker but the tongue is a hugegiveaway because everybody knowsmost well i'm pretty sure all nike sb'scome with a real fat tongue and that's abig giveaway for a lot of people okayone other very important thing before iforget to mention because i almostforgot to mention itbut as you can see inside the shoe thereis no elastic band right herethat connects the tongue so as you cansee there's nothing right therebut on the nike sb you can see thatelastic band on the inside of the footright there so that's what's going tokeep your foot more locked in and notlet youlose your foot you know or shoe fall offwhen you're skateboarding or anythinglike that sothese are definitely going to keep youmore locked in but uh that's definitelya huge huge difference onfit and everything too so i almostforgot to mention that but we're goodbecause we got it now when you look atthe profile side of the shoe right hereyou can see there's not really majordifference but one thing that i do and ialways notice is on the nike sb there'sa flap right herethat flaps out around the eyelets andthe first two holes right here and ifyou look at the regular nike dunk theflap actually doesn't go over the topand it stopsunderneath this line right here and youcan see the difference between the twoshoes in that photo right there that ijust showed you looking at the toe capsof the shoes they are slightly differentbut i can say overall it's prettysimilar so i wouldn't say that's a bigdifference betweenoh this is sb or not i think the otherthings are huge telltales compared tothe toe cap and the perforation spotsand the placement and everything likethat i wouldn't say it's a problem butit's nothing really to worry about onthat aspect one cool thing that i loveabout dunks as well is they typicallycome with the extra pair of lacesbut as you can see right here you kindof got your rope laces right hereon the nike sb and it has an additionalpair of rope laces right here on thenike sbon the regular dunk you have a flat laceand then you have additional pair offlat laces as well so typically when yousee a fat lace on the dunkthat's going to be another telltale butsome people do like to switch it outand put those in their regular dunks aswell so i can't say that's an exactindicator but typically that's how itgoesokay so these right here these insolesthese are honestly some of the biggestdifferences as well when it comes tocomfortwhen it comes to a nike dunk low and thereason why i say that yes they look thesame on this sidebut if you flip it over right here asyou can see it has a zoom air unit onthe backhere for the nike sb and this is justlike a regular phylon midsolethat you would get in a regular old dunkso that addition right there with thistechnology added to the shoeas you can see the padding here on theball of the foot in here at the hill ofthe footbut they're both still a hundred dollarsi think the spdunk alone is a better deal simply forthat reason because now you'reincorporating comfort for that same 100okay so now it is time to see what thepeople think about this shoeif you haven't already make sure youfollow me on ig so you can participatein the polls that i post on theretypically i ask people questions andthen i share the results here on thechannelso today what i asked the people is notif the shoe is fire or trashbut simply which one do you like more doyou like the nike dunk model or do youlike the nike dunk sb model more andthis is what the people said66 of the people went with the nike sband 34 of the people went with the nikedunknow me personally i'm going with thenike dunk simply off wearabilityand functionality and this is just sucha classic modelthe nike sb was created around 2002. thenike dunk has been around for over 30years there would be no nike sb if therewas never no nike dunk so i always haveto pay homage and respect to the ogand i gotta give love to the nike dunklow also with me wearing a size 13the poofy tongue and everything likethat it looks really hugetoo bulky and sometimes just doesn't gowith every outfit and i definitely canpull off a lot more fits with theregular slim nike dunk glow but thisis somewhat of a loaded question becauseif you ask me when it comes to colorwaysi honestly like the nike sb series a lotmore for thatwith the creativity and thecollaborations that they do with thenike sb'sover the more simple color blockingstyles that we see with the regular nikedunk low so when it comes to dope lookappeal and everything like that i wouldpick the nike sbwhen it comes to functionality androcking the shoe all the time i wouldpick the nike dunk lowbut at the end of the day if i couldonly pick one i would go nike dunk lowover nike sb and i know that may not bethe popular choice but again that's myopinion now it's time for you to shareyoursdown below in the comment section sodon't forget to drop a comment and letme know what you think about the twoshoes which one of these do you likemore the nike dunk low or the sbstyle more let me know down below in thecomment section i do have a couple othercomparisonswith the high tops and

you look at the history of professionalbasketball in Philadelphia Philadelphia76er went to the championship in 1977and lost to the Portland Trailblazerswent to the championship in 1980 andlost to the Los Angeles Lakers and theygot Moses Malone for 1982-1983 seasonand prior to that season Moses Malonewas wearing the franchise white Nike redswoosh perfect almost perfect 1982 who'sKilgore came up with the Nike Air ForceOne and blessed Moses Malone with thatshoe and in turn he blessed the citywith the championship in 1983so that shoe means a lot to this citybecause most Malone was that one playerPhiladelphia Sixers for one player awayand then it was Moses Moses came and hedelivered two Philadelphians to thepromised landit's called pho pho phone you say thatanywhere in the city you're 25 or olderand you like basketball you know whatthat meansfo fo-fo that's the Air Force one andthat is what Moses Malone proclaimswould be the record for 76 it was sweetfour zero four is the number and theyswept to Los Angeles Laker four games tozero the rest is historyat the time that the Air Force one hitPhiladelphia Philly was all about ballPhilly we played hard and we know how toplay and I'm not hating on the othercity cuz there's great players all overthe world but fully we do it big hereand it reflects the sneaker of the timeNike Air Force One and I say forcebecause that's what you got on the courtthe major innovation with Air Force oneis obviously in the title of the shoeitself you know the air technology Imean when we first heard there was airshoes I mean it was kind of incredible Idon't think any of us really believedthat there was air inside there and Iremember the one advertisement the AirForce One and the sole of the shoe wascutaway and did the diagram and you canactually see inside of it and they saidit was air you got to understand brosneakers made in the 70s or early 80s Imean we're really really hard on yourfeet I mean a more important thingreally at that point what used to besocks you know you look at old picturesyou see a lot of brothers with threefour sometimes five pairs of socksbecause that's what gave you yourcushioning on the concrete but when theAir Force one came out all of a suddenyou could wear one pair sock basketballshoes before 1982 we're not in modernterms comfortable they didn't offer thatcomfort or that that support thatplayers need you took a player in 2006put them in a shoe saying 80 80 81 shoethey'd be lucky if they lasted a quarterand you knowa quarter and a shoe like that theendurance and the stamina of the shoeall of a sudden changed that was therock him that's that was like what youknow raised the bar of what sneakerscould be the unique thing about Nike AirForce one is they went from being abasketball specific shoe with air a newshoe with air to issue that nowculturally is accepted worldwide peopleon other planets where Air Force OnesMartians wear Air Force one we startedselling Air Force Ones 1982 sold prettygood the guys like the soles they likejust a look of it I think what wouldreally made it was the thickness of thesole the strap they like the word air onitjust the beefiness that's the the lookthat they wanted there's a nice basiclooking shoe not too many colors if youhave the Air Force Oneyou were the Shi take back then eightytwo shoes had what they call it a runshoes will come out be out for a certainamount of time and they go awaykids in Baltimore in particular at thatpoint in time after the Air Force onehad its initial run was still coming tothe stores like you always you know canI get them once gotta get those AirForce One three retailers known as thethree amigos picked up on that havemeetings with Nike as I look why don'tyou bring back this shoot you hadCharlie Rudo sports downtown locker roomand Cinderella shoes it was Harold brutoand myself who came up with this idea ofresurrecting the Air Force one visitmeeting and I told him I wanted to bringin the Air Force Ones who would take todo it they thought we were crazythey said you guys but I believed in youguys you guys are crazy enough to askweren't were crazy enough to make it wewere forced to take twelve hundred pairof each color a white royal blue and awhite chocolate brown we took them wesold them right out the Air Force Onewas reborn this was unprecedentedwe started doing a program with Nike adifferent color each month that's whatthe shoe that my thing came fromBaltimore kids were feeling for thisshoe every month come in they're buyingevery different color where they can getthey would come up to me a paw you thinkyou can make a sky blue yeah we havethat already in the works that took itto another level this is something thatnever been done beforeback then you had almost an internetbetween New York Philadelphia Baltimoreyou had the i-95 corridor I 95 freewayexpressway link these three cities nextthing you know cats in Philadelphia inNew York getting a form oh what's goingon Baltimore and vice versa when wefound out where they were we went ohyeah people were coming down from NewYork buying shoes people were comingfrom DC buying shoes from us so the wordgot around pretty quick and it wouldhave 15 colors like Air Force Ones inWindows one all of those three timesthat's what it was we knew it wasworking we were rocking he just spreadlike wildfire this is withoutadvertising this is without nike makinga big push this is by word of mouth thisis through that internet connection thatthat preceded the digital technology byyou know decades that's where thegenesis of this whole rebirth of the AirForce one came from yeah you never knowyou sometimes you just can't figure itout it's it's like being in Las Vegasand you have the dice in your hand andyou're rolling it you just don't knowI remember I'll never forget that momentI walked into the store and I saw thesesneakers and I picked them up off thewall and I was like yo what the what artis itI was I was intrigued I wasn't sold onthem right off the bat until I waterit was the ball-playing community thatwore those sneakers off the back to playball and then it started spilling oncourt could I remember a time when wewore basketball clothes all day longlike anonyme gym shorts and everywherewe went and we had sneakers on gymshorts and a Jersey or a tank topbecause we played ball that's that's howwe live let me let me make a connectionfor you like basketball and hip-hop theythere's so intertwined it's not evenfunny like before hip-hop came along itwas nothing but basketball when we wereplaying ball like we were listening toto rap music you know and the guys thatwere involved in hip-hop you know theylove basketball a lot and play ball sothe relationship between hip-hop and andand sports period but mainly basketballis really tight into rolling meatparticularly in my life and I hadn'tgone hip-hop I'd have been a ball playerjust do it baby you know so there'salways been that connection of likehip-hop basketball New Yorkand the Styles mesh you know walkinghere is a very functional part of livingin New York you know so if you're gonnawalk you know say what do you want to beseen in the New York kid weather whetherhe's walking to school or walking towork or walking to his cornerwhatever whatever job he's doing youunderstand comfort is key the componentsis key and the bragging rights that theshoe

[Music]your wanteddip and dots inside the sole of yourshoe well nike's basically done thatwith thesebad boys so we're going to cut them opento see how they're built and we're goingto pull what's inside and count how manybeads there arein a pair of these shoes it's been alittle while since we've done a sneakeron the channel butspring's just around the corner so ithought we'd start doing some moreand i want to start doing kind of like asneaker head saturday or something or idon't know i don't even know what daythis video is going to come outbut i want to just take common sneakersand do a moreexploratory version of a cut in halfbecause the sneakers are a lot harder tojudgeyou know there's a lot more materialscience behind them so it's a lot harderjust tomake concrete opinions by cutting themin half without actuallyhaving the labs to test the materials sothe series will be more of likecut in half to show you guys what'sinside how many layers are how thick thelayers areso you can have the information to judgefor yourself if you wanta pair of whatever shoes we're reviewingand also for curiosity's sake becausethere's so much unique technology in thesneaker world compared to the boot worldlike these little dippin dots that areinside of here so the brand is nike themodel or the style is the joyride dualrunthe colorway i got is the black andlaser crimson they weigh 10 ouncesthey retail for 130 and they're made invietnam now let's go over the featuresof the shoe starting with the purpose sothis is arunning sneaker or shoe it's peoplestill wear them as regular shoes butthey're designedfor running and there's two versions ofthis these shoes there's the flyknitversions and the pair i got there's alot of reviews and there's some peoplethat already cut these in halfthe what's inside guys cut the flyknitversions in half and seth fowler alsohas a really good video on the flyknitversion so you can check those guys outso i want to do these ones just becausethey're just a little bit different theyonly i think they only have the twopockets of the beadsthat kind of leads us to the nextfeature which is the most prominentfeature of the sneaker which is thebeadsso this is kind of um it's reallystrange because i thought for sure thatthis was just kind of a little gimmickything where there's gonna be a reallythin layerbut as soon as you put these on you canfeel it there it's pretty fullof these beads and the the whole ideabehind these beads isthat it kind of gives you a custom fitevery time you take a step or every timeyouyou run because those beads displaceaccording to how your weightis distributed on the shoe and maybe themost interesting thing about thatis that you would assume that these arekind of like an air pocket like you seein the air jordans or the air force oneswhereit's sealed but every time you step downyou'reyou're pressing the air out of thesechambers and it comes up through theinsole and allows it to have a littlebit more squishwhich i thought was really interestingthey've had a little bit of issue withthe the waterproofnessof these shoes for that reason becauseif you get your shoe wetthat water can leak into here and kindof create a little swampybead zone on the inside the next featurewould be these highfriction pads here they put these hereand at the toes toprevent early wearing through thislittle chamber because i don't thinkthisthis chamber is very thick and i doubtit's a really wear resistantcompound because it's so squishy soanother kind of weird design thing isyou assume that if it's going to be arunning shoe you'd want these to bepretty durableand these these friction pads are notvery thick and i feel like you'd wearthrough this pretty quick other than thebead midsole it looks like it's got kindof a eva foam it's a really soft foammidsolethe upper is just a knit upper itdoesn't really say on their site whatit's made from i'm assuming it's somesort of polyesterknit fabric pretty simple lightweightshoethat uses a pretty pretty awesomegimmickfor being honest i really like the ideaof having these little beadsin the inside so the question i'm tryingto answer by cutting these in half isfirsthow many beads are in this thing we'regoing to count them allhow easy is it is it cut through thisthe see-through plastic or rubber on theside hereand how thick are these chamber wallsbecause you know just it's they're sosquishy i assume it would be pretty easyto like step on a really sharp rock oractually step on a piece of metal andthen your shoes arereally ruined so now let's cut them inhalf and try to answer those questionssee how these are built and see what'sinside of them and how manylittle beads there are after we talkabout the sponsor rage shadow legends isthe sponsor this video and if you'relike me you need a gameevery once in a while while you'resitting on the bus umwaiting for videos to upload or unwindat the end of the day and raid shadowlegends is a really good game for thatbecause it's nottoo simple to where you get sick of itafter a few minutesbut it's not so complicated that it'snot easy to get into and it's one ofthose games thatas you play it more you're slowlyupgrading your your characters to buildyour own team in your own way which isreally fun for me i chose the high elvesbecause they'rethey're super powerful and they're theclassic beautiful good-looking elvesthey're easy to playand they're super powerful but it's notalways clear which side they're on ifthey're good or they're bad and it kindofit's fun to build them because of thatreason so a lot of different ways toplay so once you've built your teamyou can play in a pvp round where you'replaying against other people you canplayand fight in dungeons and upgrade yourcharacters it makes it easy to sit downand play for five minutes or sit downand play for five hours if you getcarried awayand raid recently released his biggestupdate ever the doom tower it's a gianttower with 120

theybounce a lot more than you'd expect whenyou try to roll them around theyjust kind of jump all over the place butlet's see what's inside[Music][Music]these shoes are so weird i shoessneakers are they're really fun to dobecause the technology isis always progressing so much fasterthan boots and they're always so strangeand unique so the first thing i noticedwas howsoft this foam is i think this is an evafoam and it's probably the softest foami've ever felt in any shoeand it's super thick it's about an inchat the ball of the foot which is waymore than what i thoughtand what it feels like and there's theselittle structural columnsthat connect the foam midsole to theoutsole with these little like thelittle friction pads hereand i think that's to help it from beingtoo sloppy when you'rewhen you're stepping and then running itmight give it a little bit of structureto help itnot be too soft the transparent part ofthe outsole is only three millimetersthick which is thicker than i thoughtbut still prettythin if you're going to be running inthese for 100 miles or several hundredmiles i would expect these to notlast as long as i would want to get outof 130 pairs of shoesthe construction of these is acombination of a strobel stitchand cemented construction you seethere's this little stroble stitch onthe inside and it's glued to the midsolebut thethe beads are kind of the the thing thatmakes this shoe what it is but it's alsothe strangest thing because they theyreally arean odd texture they like they squishlike regular foambut they bounce like a bouncy ball whichis really odd because you know bouncyballs are such a hard density and mostthings that have a lot of rebound likethatthey aren't as light as this so it iskind of an interesting material and it'smade out of a tpewhich is a combination of rubber andplastic and then this particular tpe isinfused with air which gives its squishand its lightnessand i wish you guys could fill these iwish everyone could justget some of these and feel how odd theyare because they really behavein a really strange way especially whenyou're trying to gather them up off thetable that you spilleverywhere and these beads are whatnike claims gives these shoes a 14more shock absorption than most runningshoesso it's kind of an interesting thingit's super gimmickybut i don't know it's fun you know whodoesn't wanttheir shoes to look like they havedippin dots on the inside i'm kind of asucker forgimmicks yeah they're really really oddshoes andi guess now it's time to gather up allof these beadsand count them up off the floor and offthe table in the cupand see how many there actually are inthis shoeso overall a really fun shoe a reallyunique shoeand i like these a lot um like i saidi'm a sucker for gimmicks especially ifthey look likedippin dots and they're reallycomfortable they're not gonna lastnearly as long as most shoes but they'rethey're made for running andi don't know i feel like running shoesdon't have as long of a lifetimeso let me know what you guys think letme know what you think of these shoeslet me know what you think of these likei probably call it sneakerhead saturdayor sneaker saturdayand let me know what else you want me tocover in these videos umthere was no leather in the shoe sothere wasn't a whole lot for me to sayleather-wisebut uh this was fun i like i like doingthese videos thereis a little more casual a little morefun a little a little bit ofa little more exploratory so thank youguys for everything you doand um if you haven't watched theinstructable

Philip today is something he was apretty specialyeah it's not every day you get a boxlike this off-white for Nike NikeMercurial Vapor um I think we kind ofall know what's inside of this box Idon't actuallyit's a Virgo a blow I know but I do notknow how it looked you know you know youhaven't seen before no um you can kindof you get a gist we sell with this uheven this box right here which is prettynice is it what it is oh we got the logouh kind of guess that's logo oh that'sfor me let's go up there alright let'sdo it alrightoh that is over this mess that is somebright color does that say bag on thisoneHey it says boo back Oh actually does itdoes say boo back oh and of course itsays off-white and all that jazz andinside you do get different phrases whoathat says shoelaces obviously just so weknow what it is so we know what it isthank you burgle a blow so don't mix upthe shoelaces with the boot bag anddon't put the boot bag on their bootswhen you play I mean you can kind of seewhere we're going hereum for the height beats out there Ithink you already know what's insideboom boom we all have like this thepaper here but it's even says pay for acolor got everything with a paper withthe paper the vapor with the paper andlet's just say that these are like veryvery very very special um obviously forevery off-white our virgle Apple fan outthere this must be a wet dream and Igotta say to some extent this is also awet dream why because we have the tinyNike logo yes I'd know where it belongsso it kind of looks a little bit like aV but to you which I like a lot so uh sowhat what do we think I mean it it doeslook a bit like it yes I was just aboutto say that's then as you as youmentioned I really like this the smallswoosh yes it's rather than a big oneits undertow beautiful and to be honestI think they don't look half bad when Iwhen I saw the pictures for the firsttime I like nah kidding me uh but Iactually like them in handit actually appeals to me especiallywith this this white line here yeaharound the trim oh sorryaround the soleplate and it goes all theway around even underneath yes what'sreally really cool and for once insteadof having this very Cromieyeah finish up to the to the soleplate Ilike how it's just are not almosttranslucent plastic while in the colorone color it looks pretty big of courseit says then on the bottom ECC Flyknitand fast AF because it is a part of thefast day of night um we got the the kindof customary off-white Nike MercurialVapor and even if you're a high P's thenyou know about off y-you know whatthey're all about all the yes in it hereon the it says engineered to the exactspecification of championship athletesthat's beautiful too on the back righthere mmmengineered full speed limited edition itsays instead of vapor 360 pretty niceand then of course um the creme de lacreme we got thoughall of them on this side um and apartfrom that that's basically all theystoodI mean virgle he um yeah it's a verysimplistic way of looking at things butI think it's kind of special becausethere's not a lot of people that does itthis way no it's very it's veryin-your-face right yes because they'rebasically pointing out stuff that youalready know let you know this is a bootit's me in that regard I know a lot ofpeople really like Varga well why not Ithink some of his stuff is really cooltoo but you can't deny that he's hisstyle is very at least this style I'dlike it's done with with Nike with thehold the 10 pack they made it's it'svery like one concept with the wholequotation marks and then stating theobviousokay nice isn't it this is shoe lacesetc etc I think some people will bebummed that we don't have to hold ourread price that kind of thing but to behonest I think it would look a littlebit ridiculous confidence so that's kindof what it but you actually haven'tmentioned the - you know dots that wehave what what are those all about thiskiss I think it makes like it stands outa bit and it makes them look a littlebit like clown shoes I'm just gonna sayyeah you know don't kill me out therebut I'm just gonna say you you know youyou say you say the clown angle but I'mjust gonna go out and say that the bluedot doesn't like for me doesn't makesense it's not that in look it's notthat it looks bad it's just that likeokay I see it kind of a pattern herewith the the kind of wall vault yellowand the orange the white line and thenthe blue just pops out of nowhere it I Iwould totally totally we we do it is I'mnot saying it's bad I'm not saying it isbad it's like it's a little bit weird itis now the funny thing and i which ithink is a bit of a shaming it was thatbecause habló decided to have the thelocal thing on the side here now you canactually see how Nike had to UM tobasically toe little further up so onthe normal vapor we have this gradualshift in the Nike skin coding where itstarts to be by being fullon the bottom and then it gradually goesup the side so we can basically get amore should we say flexible image on theupper but you can basically see how theyhad to just give it our full coating allthe way up so they could write on theNike skin because they can't write on itit is very very important informationthat you get right here it's not quitetrademark for Nikeyes Nike Mercurial Vapor and the logo is69 million but that's just a start andand you can you can argue for andagainst I think I thought these arerelatively cool if we could kind of losethe blue dot and don't you know somepeople might call it you know sacrilegethen I want to lose the blue dot forwhatever but I think this really doesdoes the trick for me yeahI really love it but I really think it'sa shame that if they really had to coatit I'm REE uh in order to put the theswoosh on like just I'm gonna I'm gonnabe go ahead and be honest here as welllike if you think that someone will buythis and be like hey I'm gonna rock thison the pitch because I'm off-white fanWow and then and then complain about thefact that it's coated here yeah and Idon't think that you should get thevirtual habló I think you should go justhead and get these instead yeah becauseobviously these are virtual ah flows offwhite Nike collaboration and they arespecial they're not made to you know fora you know rainy March afternoon ohthey're not no no no but but like thefunny thing is I I gotta be honest Ithink these look alright but I have notreally warmed yet to the to the toeflush this is how I think this workshould look on the new vapor and theSuperfly that's how it is another thingpeople need to know is that this isgonna come out as a vapor 12 but on thepitch it's actually gonna be worn by aCanadian poppy who will wear a super flyversion of it so is something like thatyeah it's gonna be very interesting tosee he's obviously gonna wear it in theFrench Cup final so so pretty cool thatthey keep it with a French player inPali III like that and honestly I gottasay though that I think to go withorange and white is a more of akiller than to go with orange and kindof tinted chrome it looks it lookspretty cool right it's like even thoughit's a very hyped up colorway it's verylike in-your-face but I gotta say thatthe white toning it down makes it evenmore I I would agree with you now ofcourse this is gonna be hyped to themoon and back and that's just how it iswith with burgle Apple collaborationyeah the funny thing about virgle a blowthat we talked about just before we gotstarted was that uh it was announced abig night um that he is taking over thethe creative director position and formenswearnow the funny thing is that and yeswe're gonna talk about the box later toto show that but the funny thing is thatthat the position as creative directorspeaking of suitable boxes yes um it wasuh it was left vacant by this time Ilike in jobs yeah who basically Istepped down as the creative directorfor Louboutin in January and now they'vereleased this now is it just me or is ittoo big of a coincidence the night youhappen to collaborate with the twopeople stepping you know one stepping upone stepping down from I think it's afunny coincidenceit is it is even even though Virgilhablo did a lot of things before thiscollaboration we as Nike yes you knowit's too funny not to be but that'sthat's it just it just occurred to methat it was kind of funny I gotta say interms of this I do appreciate thesoleplate here with his name slapped allover it with his name's o Jones comeJonesoh just though that we know he's just agreat just in case you didn't knowanyways I like the the virgle a blowmade for twelve a lot more I'm gonna goahead and say this that the orange hereno pun intended but I see a pattern herewith thesorry I just had to sew on but what I dosee a pattern and I I do think out ofthese three I gotta say that the outlawsare the better look at once of all thethree I would and it's only because ofthe the the small swoosh yes and thetone down white and the same color yeson the soleplate yes so we could losethem like the blue bubble of shenanigansand the hole I'd mid all over the placedoes not really feeling that you knowbut but you know the white and the samecolor soleplate is is exactly what alsoappeals to me so good job burgle a blockum very good job actually again boncalawhatever they they say gets them face Ithink that's a good word for an inFrench I'm not sure Philipany last words on these becauseobviously people are gonna freak outabout it yeah let's just talk about thisall right this is what I really want toappreciate go ahead and preciate thatbecause that was that's pretty coolshe's you know all the details on theboxIza is pretty wicked a lot of bunny earsdid it in the paper even the paper we'veliked all the customary stuff it's it'sjust it's cool and that's the thing withwith Virgil Apple that he just makesthings that are he follows through hemakes cool things and and yeah he foundhis niche okay and he now is slappinghis trademark on different things andhe's no not doing you know any differenthere and I gotta say though I you as yousaid a lot of people will get hypedabout this boot and it's rocket Reesewith good reason but I'm not I'll reallylike the boot but I'm not on board withthe overhype no no well we you and meagree on that I'm not I'm not happyabout this because it's very gulliblei'm actually hyped about it because it'sbetter looking than I thought it wouldbe but because we both had likeexpectations of it yesover those words I think we should go weshould kind of put it out to the massesout there what do you think about thenew Nike Mercurial Vapor 12x Virgo addlow or whatever they decide to call itin the endoh do you think it's a hit just likethe the other the 10 Susan made

there's liquids that are on thefloor that they might slip onthere's liquids that might spill ontheir shoe bloodurine lots of gross stuff nurses anddoctors are some of the hardest workingpeople that we have in the worldand they're working with 12-hour shifts24-hour shifts and so it needs to besomething that's comfortable becausethey're on their feet a lotso that's what nike did when they madethis shoe in 2019. but after they weremadeum a little thing happened called acorona viruscoronavirus coronavirus to be specificcovet 19.when that happened nike was sittingthere looking at their stockpile ofthese shoes they had 30 000 shoes andthey decidedyou know what that's a lot rather thansell these to nurseswhy don't we give them away they gotthem set up so that they could send themto some of the hospitals that were hithardestreally really cool thing well of courseright when we saw that i'm like i needto see these shoes we need to reviewthem we need to see what's inside ofthemin order to give

cool theyhave little nursing cuties on themhave you ever seen anybody using those ihave not what kind of shoes do you wearright nowi wear these they are nike's too butthey're super old and kind of fallingapart i've had them for like six yearsthey don't look like they're made fornursing yeah no these look like they'llbe really coolso tate's gonna try these on and uh fortwo weeksyeah give it a shot and then we wanthonest feedback this video is notsponsored by nike we bought these shoesand they were not cheap because we gotthem on stockx so they were like threeto five hundred dollarsjust for these shoes that's not whatnike was selling them for before butbecause nike is givingall 30 000 of them to nurses around theworld there's really noneavailable for people like me or othernurses that just want to buy thembecause they're maybe their hospitaldidn't get them so she's gonna takethese to work for two weeks and then wewill follow upin this video all right goodbyeokay this is not something that i dovery often but it is uhsix in the morning and i'm up early wegave the shoes to tateum it has not been two weeks it'sactually been a month and a half and uhwe want to goand check on her and see what she thinksabout them the tricky part istate like many nurses works the nightshift so she goes to work at 6 30 p.mand she leaves and goes home at 6 30 a.mso we need to be thereat 6 30 a.m at the hospital to get herreview of the shoes becausefor her it's time to go home be therefor a few hours and go to sleep for thenight and we want to make sure that shegets her sleep[Music]right now it is a sunday morning andit's actuallyfather's day today so i know this islate when you're seeing this but happyfather's day to all the fathers that areout therei wanted to do something a little extranice for tate and for her nursing unitso i got 540.in gift cards to some of my favoriterestaurants in townit is good to do nice things for nursesthey work so hard and they doan important job that not a lot of uscould ever doi know when we had our kids i thought tomyself i am so grateful for nursesi can't believe they're here and they'redoing this job which wasn'tto me the most exciting job and you gotto think about the things that they seein the hospital when you're at yourworst[Music]because we're out in public and we wantto be safe i did get a mess so we willwear a mask when i see her todayand let's go find tate check it outthere is tate the nurseand let's see you've got the shoes ondown here how are they holdingup after a few weeks wait yeah i i likethem a lot i've had them all broken innowthey're working pretty good they'repretty comfortable they'rekind of a mix between a clog and anormal sneaker so i don't have anyproblem running around in them do yourshoes get nasty stuff on them as a nurseyou know unfortunately sometimes they dowhat have people thought about the shoesother nurses doctors anybody sayanything about them yeahalmost everybody and sometimes mypatients are like ohthey're so cute how do they compare toyour other ones that were umjust regular nike shoes that were notmade for nursing theyare different they're more comfortable iusually can't wear nikes becausei have like i need like arch support ilike like asicsbut these have helped a lot actuallythey feel good on the balls of my feetthey feelnice and padded we're on our feet for 12hours a day so we need a lot of supportthis is tate's shoe i'm gonna take itoff and make her go barefoot for asecondand i'm gonna get really far away so ican take off my mask it's held up prettywelldo i dare smell it it is dirty but ithink most of that's just from theasphalt that we're standing on right nowit looks brand new and clean on the topand she's been wearing thison four 12-hour shifts a weekand i'm impressed they've held up reallywell this is some sort of plastic on theoutside that makes it so you can wipe itoff really easilyand i do like what she said about theinside of it that theit has really good support for her footyou can see that support like in thearch area and then the balls of her feetum it does have enough cushioning thatshe said that it's safe and then on thebottomthis is like a stick free material sothat nurses when they're walking ondifferent types of flooring whether it'sslipperyor whatever it should be a non-slip typeofmaterial on the bottom which are somethings that you don't get just from aregular shoeand unfortunately a lot of nurses justwear normal shoes becausethey get what they can afford and getwhat's available um the back of theseshoes are kind of weirdyou like the way that they are they'reeasy to get on and off i doi usually my old shoes i would just stepon the box becausei would try and get out in a hurry butthese are so nice they're super easy totake on and offyou just kind of like slip them on is ittoo tight back thereno it's not but i super like it a lotbecause it grips onto the back of yourfeet so you canrun around the unit in them and theystill work okay she's had a few weeks totry these shoes onand she's got them here now we got toknow what is your rating out of10 how would you rate these shoes for anursing shoei think 10 out of 10. better than i'veever tried beforethe premise of this video is to takethese shoes off and to cut them in halfare you okay with me taking them apartif it must be done it can be done here'sa change in plans a little biti think tate loves these shoes she is anursei don't see how i can take the shoes offof her feet that she likes as a nurseand shoes that we can't get againand cut them open so yeah this is thisvideo is on the family channelwe are not going to cut open those shoesum you can keepthe shoes thank youthat actually makes me so happy how manynurses do you have on your flooroh depends on the day but likeper day there's like 20 on the floor20 maybe cool i don't know if it's gonnawork but here's some gift cards ohmy heck there's a lot of gift cards youcould give that tolike one to every nurse yes i can dothat that workthat works okay thank you thank you tointermountain healthcare for sponsoringthis videoif you have a chance go do somethingnice for a nursethere are so many of them out there andthey are literally on the front lines ofthis pandemic helping to make sure thatwe all staysafe as a reminder like i said earlierif you have some serious health issuesif you have a shortness of breathchest pains a signs of a stroke whateverit may bedon't just stay at home because you'rescared of going to the hospital becausemaybe there's some coronavirus patientstherethe

this video is sponsored by Nike you everhear the commercial be like Mike theyweren't talking about dr. Mike they'retalking about this guy oh my god guys Ican't believe I'm actually saying thisI'm officially teamed up with Nike whatam I going to be doing with Nike runningthe LA Half Marathon 13.1 miles comeApril 5th I've never ran a half marathonbefore it's my very first I'm reallynervous because I'm not really anendurance runner I'm more like ahigh-intensity interval type guy this isgonna be tough I'm really excited for itbecause a it's a challenge B it'sstepping outside my comfort zone and oneof the main reasons I'm excited about itis because Nike also wants me to testtheir new shoe called to react infinitythis is the woman shoe this is the men'sshoe actually prefer this one probably alittle bit better I'm a man that likeswearing pinkI guess not a big deal but first I wantto talk to you about my trip to the Nikeworld headquarters[Music]no I got these Nike reacting for theseshoes they're fired they're gonna helpyou build dams you have no idea thatkind of dams you could build if you getthese shoes I got you the coolest thingright off the bat and visiting NikeWorld Headquarters is the feeling thatyou're surrounded by greatness they havebuildings dedicated to the greatestathletes in the world I think myfavorite building that I visited therewas the Michael Jordan building growingup Michael Jordan was one of my biggestheroes and seeing their collection ondisplay of every single Jordan shoe thathas been released to date was in st. myfavorite Jordan shoe was the 17 I knowit's kind of a peculiar one most peoplewould say is 17 but that was the firstshoe I was able to afford when I came tothe US now I never read the book shoedogs by Phil Knight but that essentiallytells the story of how Nike started andduring this tour they showed us theintimate story of how Nike began as BlueRibbon sports how that first Nike logowas developed and sold for somethinglike $25 they showed us the first shoesthat were created by Nike moving on wewere able to check out the differentsport facilities they had there in factthey let me get a few jump shots in onthe basketball courts I was drainingthrees well maybe like at a 30 percentcompletion rate on the same core whereLBJ and MJ practice at some pointobviously also got to check out theirtrack there was actually some Olympicathletes training on it I'm not gonnadisclose anything but that was Ober cooland then I was able to take to the trackit was a little wet it was a littleslippery but I was in the zoneI was hitting my stride and I realizedI'm not in that great shape and I becameout of breath and I realized I'm gonnahave to train really hard for this halfmarathon let's talk about the reactantfiniti run shoe Nike wanted to create ashoe that would reduce running injuriesover the last thirty years we have notseen a reduction in running injuriesdespite the fact that we're putting allthese new technologies into our shoesI'm gonna be giving you my honestfeedback as to how it feels on my footbut let's talk about the research andhow they got tothe shoe to be running related injuryreduction shoe over this last 30 yearsmost of the blame for running relatedinjuries came from individuals whooverpronate meaning that when they runtheir foot inverts a little bit justlike this you'll often times see in theedge of the sneaker on the medial sideor the middle side start to wear fasterthan the outer side that could be a signof over pronating and because of that abunch of shoes hit the market that werelabeled stability shoes or motioncontrol shoes those shoes had maybeextra dense foam here or medial postinghere which is like a thickened materialin order to help stabilize your foot foreach time your foot strikes the groundthe creators of this shoe told us thatthey wanted to flip this whole theory onits head we put lots of prototypes onlots of different athletes and when wehave them running we listen to what theysay we measure all sorts of stuff whilewe're what we have then we're evaluatingthem but we're also always talking tothem to listen to what they say and whenyou do that with this prototype thatprototype the different prototype thething that they always keep coming backto the tells us feels good is pushingcushioning a rocker style bottom so theshoe translates its motion well andkeeping that flying at upper so it'sreally thin and breathable and light butalso a really lock down heel so you havedecent stability in the back end hereand they tested it it was a randomizedcontrolled study of about 200participants male and female they brokethem up randomly into two groups halfthe groups ran in this shoethe other half ran in the Nike structure22 shoe which is a motion control shoewhat do they find those who ran in thereact infinity shoe here had a fifty-twopercent less likelihood of developing aninjury how do they classify theserunning related injuries well if therunners experienced pain due to runningand it caused them to miss three or moreruns that considered a running relatedinjury you know me when it comes topeople doing medical research I'm askeptic first especially if it's somekind of revolutionary new study it'svery rare that one study comes along andchanges the way we've been doing thingsbecause the way you normally do it isyou have a hypothesis generating studythan a pilot study and then you startedadapting and figuring out how to chainwhat you're doing in this case they hada hypothesis let's do away with motioncontrol and focus more on cushioninghere they did this first study and itwas a small study they admit that theyadmit that they there's a lot that theydon't knowin fact when j war vets was giving ushis speech at the nike worldheadquarters i was really impressedbecause of how many similarities therewere between the research he was doingin the nike lab - how I treat mypatients first of all he was not afraidto say I don't know the challenge isthat that they're just there reallyisn't a lot of information that's reallyreally well-known like for example likeexactly how many runners are gettinginjured each year we don't know what arethe the mechanisms of these injuries wereally don't know this is a scenariowhere the answers aren't there we haveto figure this out and we want you guysto come on a journey with us so we cansolve thisI appreciate that level of humilitysecond instead of just looking atobjective measures they also askathletes what worked for them when therearen't these well known scientific youknow this knowledge where we alwaysstart is with the voice of our athleteswe work with our athletes we you knowput lots of different shoes on them lotsof different prototypes and we'reconstantly talking to them sure we're inthe lab with our metrics and we'reanalyzing everything their kinematicstheir kinetics yeah but we're alsolistening to their voice and saying youknow what feels good what feels goodwhat feels good what feels good and wentover and over and over again the answeris the same cushioning when you give mecushioning and you do it right that'swhat feels good my body feels good wellthat's what we're starting from when Isee my patients yes I look at theirvital signs yes I look at their labvalues but I also talk to the humansitting in front of me there's a lot ofvalue in that and I'm glad that Nikesseeing that talking to their athletesgives them value when I say athletes Idon't just mean their top tier athleteslike LeBron James I'm talking aboutweekend warriors I'm talking about youat home who wears Nike sneakers to gofor a run once a month you're an athletetoo and they're listening to you

will meetyou at the other side after you completeall your black back loop and doublecrochets I made it around to my laststitch and we're going to slip stitch tojoin but you see how I notice I put themarker for the very first stitch whichis over here and the last stitch that'sso I know is the very last dish becausesometimes it can leave a big space and Itend to put an extra one there so youguys don't want to do that so thinkabout putting the marker so you canalways keep a track of how many stitchesyou have so let's slip stitch to joinlike I said you should have a total of37 single crochets for that last rowchain 1 if we're going to single crochetinto the same space and Brooklyn asingle crochet in each stitch across okguys single crochet in each stitchacross and I'll meet you at the

these are an unfair improvement overnormal running shoes[Music]inside of these boxes i have the twoshoes that are the greatest innovationin nike running that they'veever done have you heard about the twohourmarathon because nike was able to haveone of their runnerstrain work on research and developmenton these shoesfor years and years and then run andactuallybreak the two hour marathon which a lotof people didn't think was humanlypossible this is the shoe that theyfirst tried to break the two-hourmarathon inand they missed it by like a minute ortwo it was so dang closethis is the vapor fly and what's cool isthat when lincoln designed his own shoethree years agothey actually let us see these in thetop secret r d lab and they told us thatinside of here is a carbon fiber platewhich makes it really hard to actuallybendbecause there's a carbon fiber platewhich should help youget propelled on every step and go alittle faster kind of like a springit got really controversial because alot of the nike runners were going to beusing these in the olympics that didn'thappen because of corona and the otherrunners that weren'tusing these shoes were a little upsetabout it saying that this gave them anunfair advantagein the end they ruled that as long asthese are sold to the general public andit's not some prototype versionthen runners can use those shoes insideof the olympicsso it's sold to the public i was able toget some well after they failedbreaking it with thisthey made the alpha fly and this is theone that broke itand you can see a little bit of adifference in the back it still has thisfunky littleaerodynamic pointy thing that looks likeit should have like a knife on it that'sgonna stab somebodybut um on the front you can seean air zoom pocket on here these are sotightlike i can barely move them we're goingto explore the insideof this shoe and see what the deal islike what does the carbon fiber platelook like is there anything else insideof this shoethat makes it amazing and then the thingthat i want to knowis how well would this work on anaverage runner like a regular everydayperson that you seejogging on the street not somebodythat's entering the boston marathonand finishing in the top ten in order todo a real world test of this shoewe need a runner so i got my uhcameraman heretoday it's not really my cameraman wegot zach from jerryrig everythingif you haven't noticed this guy has somemusclesand as part of that how often do you runitry to run every day a little bit um along time ago like six or seven yearsago i ran a couple marathons but i amnot in marathon shape right nowbut i am a runner kind of two weeks agozach ran what was it three miles exactlythree miles in 24 minutes and 24seconds how does that compare to yourusual time that was like me pushingmyself to the limitin regular shoes adidas boost tothese guys these guys the ultra boostthe ultra boostand so now if i run the same route inthese shoespushing myself the same way if i runfaster that means these shoes would giveme the advantage righti feel like it's a fair test it's in themorning it's early it's when he ran he'sgoing to run the same routethat he ran last time i'm going to bethere at the beginning and at the endhow do you track your runs just on myphone just the appyou just carry a phone in your pocketwell i carry my hand because thejust like this you just hold that thewhole time the whole time he just holdshis phone[Music]you already looked faster just byputting that on you look faster on thatone footthe aerodynamics[Music]they feel incredibly bouncy like it'shard to describe likei'm actually bouncier than a bouncy balllike you're walking on bouncy balls evenmore than that you know those giantexercise ballslike the bounciness of those is now onmymy legs want to go like thisi don't know this is going to be a weirdtest you look so fast those shortscouldn't have beenany more perfect so basically the guybroke the two hour marathonyou want to break the 24 minute threemilethree mile is that what you're what isthat what you're thinking like 25seconds left or something like that yepthat would be that's my goal we'll seewhat happens um last time i did pushmyself pretty hard though so we'lllet's see what's song choice today umthere's amaybe we shouldn't talk about music[Music]you ready i'm ready when you are meetyou back at the finish line all i haveto do is drive my carright hopefully i'll see you in lessthan 24 minutesokay jump for cars see buddyoh he already looks like he's bouncingwell i'm excited to getzach's thoughts whether he breaks it ornot um he'll have some good insightslet's go track zach down and then seehim at the finish line[Music]because there's a carbon fiber platewhich should help youget propelled on every step and go alittle faster kind of like a spring[Music][Applause][Music][Applause]zach is on the home stretch right now iam at milethree i see him at the top of this hillhe's just got to come down the hill andcomefinish so i'm excited to see the numbersi didn't track it on my phonehe's pushing it pretty good for a bigman 205 poundsand this guy's got a lot of muscle let'ssee how tired he is we might need togive him a break to chill for a secondhere he comes is that three miles finishcheck that you broke your new recordseven minutefour second mile that's insanethat's like take my record of 24 minutesrightyeah and slash three minutes off whatthat's crazy i did it instead of 24 24i did it in 21 19. dude that's a lot oftime yeah that's insaneand you feel like a lot of it has to dowith the shoes or you're just pushing itnow oh 100the shoes like before we started makingthis video myinch spiel at the end was gonna be likeit doesn't matter what equipment youhaveyou can just run in whatever and stillbe great but these arethese are an unfair improvement overnormal running shoesyou said earlier it felt like you wereon bouncy oh you catch your breath for asecond dude i'm good nowi'd go for another three i felt like iwasn'tusing as much effort as before and youknowi weigh a lot and so my right kneeusually hurts while i'm runningbut this time around nothing likethere's so much cushion in these shoesand likeit's crazy but one negative thing sincei weigh a lot i go throughshoes fast and the soles of these shoesare not like rubber they're likefoam there's quite a bit of wear rightthere like alreadylook at the front right there it'salreadylosing some of its tread just from athree-mile runyeah these shoes aren't gonna last verylong i love them though great shoesokay again i don't think i've said thisyet but this is not a sponsored video ispent like 300on these shoes you know zack he's goingto be completely honest with his opinionif he would have done worse or theywould have hurt him he would have saiditso we didn't just shave 24 seconds offof his time we shavedminutes off of just a three minute milejust a three mile run and he shavedminutes off of his timethe shoes definitely are working thankyou zach for helping us with this partof the videolet's get these back to our studio cutthem in half see what's inside of themand uh let lincoln guess what theresults are i'm curious to see if youcan even get close to guessinghow much faster zac run zack runzach ran i'm smartwe are back at the studio with mr nikehimselflincoln marcum look at that nike shirt alot of people have askeddid we purposefully block out the nikelogo no i mean for youtube videosthere's another nike swoosh right belowit this is the way it's changedright so these are the shoes lincoln hasseen them a little bitum like very bright andthey look kind of beat up zach hastested theseand they're very light these are thelightest shoes that i've ever heldleslie do you know the results of zack'srun i don't okay come hereyou do it i'm wearing matching greenzach ranthree miles as hard as he could in 24minutestwo weeks later we gave him these shoeshe ran three miles same routeyes and um how fast do you think he ranit in the issue 21 minutesexactly 21 minutes was it really yeah ohmy gosh well it's like 21 something it'slike 20 yearsbut it's still what he had to approachyou you didn'ttell me honestly i just did my mathgoing okay that's eight milesa minute zach has to be faster than thatin general exactly no that was his fasttime nono i feel like you're faster than thatnope the shoes are a minute fasterno i think that zach had the potentialto run faster tootry it again i think you can do betteroh 100the shoes that was like me pushingmyself to the limit zach and i werereally impressed with the shoeand that it could improve his time by aminute that yeah for an average runnerthat's impressiveleslie is not impressed with the shoeand she says that needs to step it upzach has more physical capabilities yougot to step it up zachyou're faster than that we got to followthe data the data doesn't lielook at these shoes try squeezing themit's hardit's hard that's what helps propel youlikeisn't that crazy[Applause]barely bend them in half where you takemost shoes and yeah the toe bendseasily where with this one if you canget an extrainch or two inches on every singlestride without any additionalphysical body effort well yeah you'regoing to arrive at your destinationfaster it's just simple math right rightdestinationyes math and see through tooso that's truegot it got it yes when you have arunning shoe you want it to beincredibly lightwell the top portion is a place of ashoe where peopleadd a lot of weight a lot of fabric andcloth that doesn't need to be therethis is so light there's nothing to itexcept for the backwhere it has a little cushion rightthere for your foot so that it doesn'tget asyou get blisters and stuff right there ithink this might be the carbon fiberplateright there that we're looking at hasthe two airzoom pockets that are on it you can pokeit should we poke it and see if it makesit nice do you think it'll popi think so here we goyeah made a little hissing noisenow let's see how it looks oh wowthey got to make that super strongthough because if that pops like duringyour raceso here's the inside of your zoom pocketit basically looks like whoa it's reallya tennis ballyeah or like a minky blanket if you'veever felt one of thoseit's incredibly soft yeah i was thinkingthat maybe it had some sort of springingeffectand there's got to be some sciencebehind this but really it's just someweird fabric that's in theremy knife was a lot sharper before istarted this project today[Music]it's like i'm filleting a fish right nowhey there's the foam yeahand then this says nike fly plateyeah it's basically the same materialjust ohwow look at that well you can break thecarbon fiber plate with your bare handsmuscles okay do you think that it wasbecausepart of this was off i think it'sbecause of my musclesthat is odd that it just fell offoh i'm so strong look at thatlook at that shoe wow that is sointerestingcarbon fiber it's very big it's veryvery wide right here where you land andthen it does get thinneron the back which makes sense well maybeit doesn't make sense i don't know i'mno engineer but it's like a spring itreally is like a springthat when you step this is this ismaking you just fly an extra inch or twoi am a believerin the nike alpha fly shoethere's also the vapor fly that we gaveto zach those who have similartechnologythey're also speed improvement shoes soum good job nike he's getting at therunning game and kicking some butt andit's coollet me know what you guys think wouldyou buy these shoes for a race is itworth it for aweekend warrior runner and do you thinki can break this with all the foam on itno ohit sounded like it wanted to right wowmuscles whoa yeahwow okay well you canyou can break it that one broke easilytoowow 75 but don't bend your shoe don'tbet yourselfthere's got to be a weight limit like ifyou weigh like 300 poundsyou're gonna run a marathon on thisthing it's just going to snap in themiddle just like thati mean whose foot does this though whenyou're runningyes maybe this is how my foot looks wheni runmaybe not maybe not it's like birthdaysmaybe we shouldn't

hi everyone kevin here from golf guyreviews and in today's video i'm goingto give you my full reviewof the nike react infinity pro golfshoesnow these currently retail in the uk for100 pounds and 120in the us and they are very much thetake down baby brother modelof the air zoom infinity tour golf shoeswhich retail for 150 pounds here in theukso in this video today i'm going to giveyou my full and honest review of theseshoesi'm going to tell you what they fit andfeel like on feet and i'm also going totell you how they performout on the golf course and i'm alsogoing to let you know about some othershoes that you might want to consideras an alternative to these ones in thesame price bracketnow i haven't finished reviewing theinfinity tour golf shoes but as soon asi doi will include a link above to my fullreview and i'll also do a comparisonagainst these shoes so i'll let you knowwhat i think in regards to the fullversionsagainst these takedown models and i'lllet you know which ones i think youshould buybut for now we're gonna do a full reviewof these shoes and let's jump straightinso in a bit i'm going to tell youexactly how these fit my feet and whatthey feel like out on the golf coursebut for now we're going to start withactually the upper and just kind of goover very briefly the designdetails of the shoe and the materialsthat they've usedso first of all the main component ofthe shoe here on the upperis the nike skin material which is kindof asynthetic leather upper material andthey've done something quite interestingwith this shoeand that's that they've actually put atexture on the shoeto make it look like a flyknit upper sowith the infinity torsos you've actuallygot flyknit material it's a full-blownknitted materialwhereas on this it's made to look like aknitted materialbut it certainly doesn't feel like aknitted material in fact what i wouldsaywith this upper to begin with is that iwas a little bit disappointed with it ifi'm being totally honestbecause it's not the softest feelingupper it feels a little bitcheap if i'm entirely honest and ahundred pounds that's still asignificant amount of money here in theuk to spend on a pair of golf shoesand i would have hoped that it wouldhave felt maybe a little bit nicer i'veactually gota pair of the react vapor twos herewhichalso use the nike skin and it just feelsa little bit softer if i'm honestin regards to the color ways there arefive different options with this shoeand i've gone for this classic kind ofblack and white version because ithought it looked quite coolactually but there are some quitestandout color ways that you can reallylook to be bold on the course with socheck them out for sure if that'ssomething that interests youand you can see here on the upper as imentioned you've got this flyknitpattern here on the toe boxand then you've got some texture in hereon the side you've got like a trianglepart there on the side of itand the upper goes right the way aroundto the hill it's quite ai would say quite an exaggerated kind ofhill area there you can seeon the back of the shoe you've got thisreally cool kind of tapeuh structure with nike running up theback of it so i think that looks quitecool and you can see on the nike swooshthereyou've also got the polka dot pattern aswell another element that i really likein regards to the design of the shoeis this camo pattern that you've got onthe back so hopefully thekind of you can see it there on thecamera you've just got a very verysubtle hint of this camo patternthat just looks really cool and inregards to the design as well you've gotjust a little bit of rippling on thebottom of the midsole foam nowthat you can just kind of make out andthat goes all the wayaround the shoe let me know in thecomments what do you think of this shoedo you like the look of itor do you actually prefer the look ofthe bigger brother of the infinity tourthe look of the shoe is very modern it'svery slim and sleek and that's becauseit's based on the infinityrunning show so it's quite a good matchof the silhouetteand once again nike have turned one oftheir running shoesinto a pair of golf shoes which is justthe consistent theme at the moment fornike they don't seem to be doinganything elsebut turn their running shoes into golfshows at the momenton the midsole here you can see becauseit quite clearly says that you've gotnike react foam which if you've neverused beforeis a very nice soft comfortable foam butfeeling this on feet i've gotta sayagaini was a little bit disappointed with theshoes because it just didn't seemthat soft i don't know whether it'sbecause they've not usedlots of the nike react foam here itseems like there's a decent amount of itbut compared to other nike react shoesthat i've used in the pasti just didn't feel that i was reallygetting the benefit of the softness thatnike react can provideit was there these were comfortableenough underfootand they're certainly not uncomfortableunderfoot in regards to the softness andthe responsivenessit just wasn't super soft and squishythere are softer feeling nike shoesin their golf range than these so i wasa little bit surprised at thatand if i'm honest a little bitdisappointed too i really hope youenjoyed this video so far so hit thatlike button if you are and if you arefinding it helpful and you want to keepup to date on all my latest

button andmake sure you press that bellnotification so you can keep up to datewhen i post my latest videosso let's move on to the fit and in thisshoe i went true to size so i got a uknineand it fit me lengthwise for sure but itis quite a tight fitso i did have enough room at the toe butit definitely felt the size of the shoepushing against the sides of my feet itdoes mean that you do feel quite niceand tight and locked into the shoebut if you've got wide feet then thismight not be the shoe for you becausethere's currently not a wide fit optionavailableor if you just like to have the feelingof a little bit more wiggle room in thetoes of your feetagain this might not be the show for youin regards to the heel and the ankleareathere's an average amount of room iwould say in there in regards to paddingthere's nothing particularly specialgoing on with the padding area of theankleand again of the tongue there's a littlebit of padding in the tonguebut it's not particularly thick you cansee there that it kind of sits quitewide across the showbut you know it wasn't uncomfortable ididn't get any blisters in the ankleor the top of my foot however i did getblistersvery much so in the hill of this show soagain as i feel it therethere's a little bit of padding going onbut there's not too much and of courseyou've got this exaggerated kind of heelarch going on at the back thereand for me the way these fit my feet iwas getting some serious blisters afternine holeson the heel of the show you've also gotan internal heel counter with this shoeand my fit did feel quite nice andlocked in in the hill area um which iswhy i was kind of surprised that i gotthose blisters because i certainlydidn't really feel any slipping going onum but just the way that that kind ofhill area works with my footjust i suppose doesn't agree with it nowi mentioned that it's not the softestfeeling nike shoeunderfoot especially in regards to thereact phone i was quite surprised withthatbut also i've got to point out as wellis that i did feel a bit of pressurepoint as wellon this kind of spike area here now iwill talk about the sole of the shoe ina little bit and go on in regards to thespikes and how they grip the turf andhow they performed out on the coursebut i could definitely feel a little bitof pressure on the outsideof the midfoot area there and after afew holes that kind of disappearsbecause you get used to it i supposebut when i compare them against othergolf shoesstraight out of the box for example withthe react vapor twosi didn't have that feeling whatsoeverwith these shoes these feel nice andflat on my foot and felt that they gavethem a good amount of supporti can really feel the difference withthese shoes so againthat's something you might want to tryit before you buy these shoes make surethat you're comfortable with the waythat they fit your feetso let's take a quick look at the soleof the shoe and you can see here thatthese have got the veryunique piston spikes that nike have usedfor these shoesas well as the infinity tour models soyou can see here that you've got thesetwo large spikes at the front here andyou've got a verylarge one at the rear as well and theseare kind of designed to be flexible soyou can kind of see here if i move thatto the camerayou've got a lot of give and movement inthese spikesand the idea is is that they improve thecomfort and kind ofconflicts with the ground giving you asmuchgrip as possible now i've got to saythat i was actually quite impressed withthe level of grip from these shoesi didn't sleep once with them and theyseemed to do quite a good jobi didn't have the chance to wear thesein really heavy wet damp conditionsunfortunately so i can't speak for howthey perform therebut out on a dry course and a earlymorning jury course they performed quitewell indeed and i waspleasantly surprised with that as wellas the comfort underfoot i've got to saythat i suppose i didn't really noticethe feeling of themum so yeah i was quite impressed withthose you have got to consider the factthough that thesearen't replaceable so if you do breakone of these spikes off then you got tobuy a new pair of shoesbecause your grip is going to becompromised so that's really interestingto see how that works outlet me know down in the comments whatyou think would you prefer to go for amore traditional set of spikes cleatsuh that you'll be able to replace or areyou happy and comfortable going withthesepermanently spiked golf shoes anotherthing to point out with the shoes aswell you can kind of see hereis that the bottom of the shoe has gotthis coating on it so if you just hearhereit's kind of like a plasticky tpucoating i suppose very thinand going over the react foam and i waswondering whether or not this was goingto affect the grip of the shoeuh because it is kind of slippery to behonest um and it's got this wavy patternbut to be totally honest i didn't reallynotice an issue with it at all itperformed absolutely fineyou have got an area here at the frontthis year where you've just got no gripwhatsoever but again for the way that ihit the ballpersonally i didn't notice it but i didjust want to kind of highlight itto you watching this video while we'retalking about the performance of theshoe in regards to the upperwith the nike skin here nike say thatthis is a breathable materialand personally i've never reallyparticularly found thatum my feet on quite a warm day weregetting quite hot and stuffy in theseshoesum you know it wasn't terrible it didn'tmean i had to take them off and itwasn't too uncomfortablebut i wouldn't call this the mostbreathable material available out on themarketalso in regards to the upper i didn'tmanage to test these in the rainso i had to do a little bit of a testhere at home so as you can see i took acontainer with 300 milliliters of wateron the shoesand i poured it on the upper and i didfocus on the tonguearea as well in regards to the upper theneck was waterproof that didn't let anywater throughhowever with this tongue you can seewhen i actually take my shoes offthat actually the water does creep downthe sides of the tongue and actually gotmy foot quite weton both sides as well as underneath soif youare caught in a heavy heavy downpour inthese shoes then your feetaren't necessarily going to stay drythere is a little bit of water creepingin around that tongue areabut for the most part the upper is niceand waterproof for thevast majority of time you're going to beusing these shoes in regards toperformance i also wanted to talk aboutthe stability of the shoesso with the upper it is quite stiff andfirm as i mentioned earlierso that does give you a fairly decentamount of stability with the shoeand you've also got some structuralelements as well so you can see here onthe lateral sidetied into these two laces here you'vegot this kind of triangle kind ofarea here which is giving you a littlebit more reinforced stability and you'vealso got that the sameon the medial side as well so in regardsto the upperi think it had a decent amount ofstability but what i would have to sayis that these are quite a narrow shoeyou've not got the widest platform thereto begin withand on a very very dry day on a very drycoursei did find that i was a little bitwanting for stabilityyou do feel that actually if i had awider platformthen i would definitely have a bit morestability with these shoes so again thatis something to be considerate ofi'm not saying that these arenecessarily unstablebut i'm saying that there are definitelymore stable shoes out there on themarketcertainly in this price range even innike's own range of golf showsso again that's just something you mightwant to think aboutbefore purchasing these shoes youdefinitely want to try them on foryourselfso when it comes to spike golf shoes foraround 100 poundswhat are your alternatives well i'vementioned it a few times already andi've got to say that personallyi would go with the vapor react 2insteadfor me they have a slightly wider fitthey've certainly got a wider base onthem so they feel like a more stableshoeand under foot they're far morecomfortable even though they both usethe react foamthe react foam in the vapor too justfeels that much softeryou've also got flywire technology inthe shoes here so you canreally pull that upper in and you've gota lot more padding in the ankle and heelareaand i've got to say i've neverexperienced blistering with these shoeswhereas i definitely experienceblistering in the hill with these shoesat the moment these retail anywherebetween 80 to 100 pounds here in the ukand i would personally say that this isa better choice comparedto the react infinity tours anotheralternative i've got to suggest is thenike roshi gtours again they're around 100 poundmark you might be able to pick them up alittle bit cheaper in the cellthey're a little bit more plain andsubdued compared to the infinity prosbut for me personally i think they're amore comfortable fit and they givebetter performanceultimately you see professional playerson the tour with the rocheg tour as well as the react infinity prono wait what these called the reactvapor twos that's what they're calledbut i don't think you're going to seeany proswearing the infiniti pro now if you wantto check out my full reviews i've got afull review of boththe react vapor twos as well as theroche g tour and i've even got acomparison video as wellof the roche age tours against theseshoes so you can check them out in thedescription belowfor a hundred pounds you've also reallygot to consider the adidastour 360 xt golf shows you can oftenfind them yourselves for around 100pound markand they to be honest are a far superiorgolf shoe compared to these onesthey're going to give you a lot morestability they're going to be a lot morecomfortableand personally i prefer the look ofthose golf shoes compared to thesebut again that's just personal choiceand preference so it's totally up to youagain i've got a full review of thosegolf shoes so you can check them out inthe description link belowso there you go that's my full review ofthe nike reactinfinity pro do i think these are worth100 poundsjust about possibly if you really likethe look of theseand you can't justify the extra money togo upto the air zoom infinity tour golf shoesthen if you're buying these on looksalonefill your boots enjoy yourself you'vegot plenty of color options therethey're not a bad looking shoethey perform okay fine but to be honesti think there are better golf shoes outthere on the marketfor a hundred pounds there are betternike golf shoes currently available for100 pounds so i think you shoulddefinitely at least considerchecking those out as an

hey everyone kevin here from golf guyreviews and today we're going to becomparing to night despite shows we'regoing to be taking a look at the rush ag tour which currently retailed on thenight website for around a hundredpounds although i did buy this pair onoffer for around sixty five pounds andwe're going to be comparing that againstthe night react vapor tube currentlyretailing on the night website for 130pounds and again i bolt these ondiscounts for ninety five pounds so ifyou liked this video please hit thatlike button feel free to subscribe to mychannel where we'll be looking at otherreviews of golf shoes tech and clothingand I thought what we'd do today is takea look at the features of both theseshoes see what you get for your moneyand see which one we think is best sofirstly looking at the upper of the rusha this is a synthetic leather design andit's a pretty soft leatheryou know this software out there butultimately this is it's not a top-endshows not a top-of-the-range show andit's kind of tackling that mid-rangemarket price point so it's quite a nicesoft leather upperyou've got a decent amount of padding onthe inside there with the sock liner andyou've got a tongue which goes right theway through down to the bottom and againis relatively padded but it's it's apretty bog-standard designed to behonest and the roster is copying youknow the really popular rush a styletrainer to be honest is that popularI've got two pairs at the moment and Ireally really like the rush a supercomfortable trainer and so I can seeexactly why they've decided to copytheir style it's quite a plain lookingshoe so if you're not looking foranything too fancy or too flashy thenthis could certainly be the show for younow if you compare that to the Naikreact vapor - then this got little bitmore going on for it as you can seethere's a little bit more detailing onthe shoe it's also a synthetic leatherupper now both are waterproof but if youhave a look on the upper of the react -you can actually seethere's a little bit of Italian on theupper there and that's designed to addsome additional comfort some softnessit's actually some technology thatthey've used in a lot of their footballboots as well to give the players betterfilm or with the ball and it is aslightly softer leather in my opinionit's a bit of a softer feel to it withthe upper as well with the react whatyou're getting is you're getting theFlyknit technology as well so on theRoche the laces are just kind of gothrough this little bit of lever here oneach side and they secure the the shoethat way it gives fire security acrossthe shoe there's nothing too specialgoing on there compare that with the flyin it which you know nike using a lot oftheir technology on their shoes rightacross the different ranges the fly andit means that when you tie up theshoelaces they're going through theselittle corner hooped wire pieces ratherthan going straight into the lever andthose are connected further in the shoeso when you do up the show it's pullingthe shoe right across the foot from alower position and it's really helpingto lock that shoe your foot in the shoenice and tight with the vapor too aswell you see that you've got a splittongue design as well whereas the rush Ijust had a pretty traditional standardsolid tongue and a Gorham it I'd neverhad a shoe with a split tongue beforeand actually it really did make quite abit of difference I felt that the tonguewhen I did the laces up my son - itlocked down around my foot and was a lotmore comfortable to be honest it's onlya very thin tongue it's just a littlebit of material really so there's notmuch of it compared to the Roche whenyou've got a little bit more padding alittle bit more traditional but I didn'tfind that that affected the overallcomfort of the shoe and so I quite likedthe split tongue design looking at thesoleplate of both shoes you can see herethat they are absolutely identicalthere's going to be no difference interms of the amount of traction thesetwo shoes are giving youwhen it comes to style of the two showsit kind of depends what look you prefergoing forward really as I said beforewhen we looked at the uppers the rush ais a much more planar design show it'snot very fleshy at all so if that's thetype of goal shoe than you that you wantthen you've still it still looks like areally good show I still really like thedesign of it but it's certainly a littlebit more plainer when you compare thatwith the vapor to then this is certainlya little bit more fleshy but still it'snot too trainer like it's I'd say it'sin between a trainer style show and aand a traditional level of golf shoe butof course it's quite aggressively styledyou've got the contrasting color waysthere you've got the textured materialon the top the laces you can't quite seein the video here but the laces are andskinnier and just a slightly differentstyle look compared to their to thebigger traditional rushes and what Ithink happens here with with the withthe texturing as well is that it makesthe react vapor to does look a littlebit skinnier to me when you look down onit but ultimately it just depends whatyou're looking for in the style of agolf shoe when it comes to looking atthe mid souls of these two shoes that'swhere you get a significant differencestarting with the Roche this uses thetraditional Luna non midsole foam whichis absolutely a very very comfortablemid foam they've been using that stylemid foam for several years and it is avery nice all day comfortable midsoleyou get a lot of good cushioning from ityou get a lot of nice support from itand it works really well in a golf shoeso as I say I've got a couple of pairsof trainers of them with these and theyare very very nice with the trains towalk around in all day for I know thatI'm going to go for a long walk for outthe day I have not got an issuewearing the rush age whatsoever so ifsticking them in a golf shoe certainlymakes sense and it gives you a lot ofcushioning and a lot of support thatsaid when you then compare it to thereact foam midsole and you can see thenicelittle bit of detailing in the back ofthe shoe there when you compare it tothe react midsole you then notice thatactually the react is the newertechnology and the react is Mike'sequivalent or rival to the adidas boosttechnology and so by what I mean by thatis that it's really going for a softcushioned fill with a good amount ofbounce back and responsiveness so youfeel that when you're kind of puttingenergy into the midsole and you'reyou're pushing off the ground then it'sactually returning quite a bit of thatenergy to you as well when you get agood bounce and fill so it's thecombination of the soft comfort mixedwith the bounce fill and to be honestthis is where one of the key differencesI can see with it with a pricedifference so you don't forget you'vegot the rush a standard price 100 poundscompared to the vapor vapor to standardprice 130 pounds and the difference inthe midsole alone is enough for me tojustify that price difference I when Ifirst tried these because I'm a I'm abig fan of the booster and the comfortit provides and this certainly isdefinitely right up there as well samewith the pew Marie Premier ignite foamthat is a very comfortable foamthis is equally up there and is anextremely comfortable golf shoe so ifyou're looking for a shoe for thecomfort that you can walk all down thecourse and both of them are going toprovide that comfort but it depends whatyou're looking for in the show really ifyou're looking for something that's alittle bit less expensive stillcomfortable but not quite as not quiteas responsive in the sole then the Rocheis a great shoe if you're looking to forme personally go for that ultimatecomfort that you can provide in a shoethen the react is the more comfortableand soft the feeling of the two phoneslooking at the rush A's and feeling therush A's on they still feel like acomfortable golf shoe and I think it'sreally really good value for money thatyou get with these a good waterproofsynthetic leather based show that's niceand comfortable to vote and looks goodbut when you do compare that side byside to the additional comfort thatyou're getting from the vapor toes I'vegot a mitt that my foot does feel morecomfortable in these shoes it does feela little bit more locked down andsecured around the the top of the footarea and actually does feel to be alittle bit more room in the toe box ofthe vapor tote when you compare that tothe Roche the Roche if it was a littlebit more restricted I think that'sprobably because the leather is just alittle bit more tougher in there so I'msure it's gonna break down after timebut initially straight out of the box ifI had to pick a pair to play with todayI'd be picking the vapor toes so whichis the better show the russet or G orthe react vapor toe well I think it allcomes down to budget really if you areon a strict budget and are looking toget a mid range spite night golf shoethat's gonna be nice and comfortable andwaterproof and it's gonna see youthrough for the next couple of yearsthen the rush a is a good place to lookit is it is a good looking shoe as I sayit's more reserved in the styling but itis nice and comfortable and that midsolein there is nice and soft and grip wiseyou're gonna get exactly the samestability and grip from the Roche asyou're going to get from the vapor tubebut in my opinion the react to is thebetter show there's a lot moretechnology going in to this one whetherit's the different upper of thesynthetic leather with the texture andit's got that softer more secure feel tome you've got the split tongue foradditional lockdown and comfortyou've got the fly wire which reallyhelps with the stability and lockingdown your foot inside the show and thenyou've got the react foam which reallyreally is comfortable and you can whenyou compare the toe you can feel thedifference that the react is the morecomfortable soft or fun so if you canjustify it the additional 30 pound thenI would definitely recommend the insidebecause personally I think it's a betterlooking shoe it's got a little bit morestyle to it and it is the morecomfortable shoe so ultimately thatextra 30 pound actually goes quite along way but hey let me know what youthink let me

the thing that makes the Pegasus uniqueis that it is so consistent the Pegasuswas the joint effort of about 15 peopleinvolved in the design there was noscientific process to come up with aname but it was symbolic it played intosome of our Greek heritage with Nike theGreek goddess of victory Pegasus youknow it's the Greek name of the halfhorse half winged animal and this ishalf air have regular shoe I had startedmy career in Boston in 1979 and Ithought I was going to end likecompetitive marathon career in 2008 Iwas having calf problems at the time andI didn't want the Olympic Trials whichwas supposed to be my last marathon tobe the race where I had to drop out so Itrusted the peg so much that rather thanwearing a racing shoe I ran with the pegI justso trust the peg the 37 is amazingbecause the update was pretty giganticfor the Pegasus the midsole that'sreally where the newness starts theentire midsole is made up of react foamit is lighter more responsive and moredurable than that catch-all foam it wasalmost a no-brainer the bag you see inthe 37 is more than 2 times thicker thanthe previous bag it does not necessarilymean you go 2 times faster but we knowthat you get more response out of theshoe[Music]so the difference between the men's shoein the women's shoe specifically in thezoom bag is that the women's shoethrough we're testing has been tuned tobe about 15 psi that's just a little bitless pressurized than the men's shoewhich is about 20 psi and the tweaksthat we made in the zoom bag was whollyinformed by what women truly wanted theycame back to us consistently and wereasking for a little bit of a less stiffride so just serving exactly what theirwants were through the technology andthe zoom bag if you go back a coupledecades and you put on a pair of runningshoes your first reaction would be Ifeel like there's very little cushioningand very little responsiveness[Music]that's unbelievable knowing that this isbetween you and the ground yeah it makesme feel pretty good come onit's the peg which is why I've been withyou for so long it's a workhorse forgenerations now of runners isn't thatthe ultimate thing when it comes to arelationship can I count on you the pegis always stepped up and said yes whichi think is something that runners of thepegasus really enjoy the fact thatyou're going to make my Pegasus betteryou[Music],17,UCCHFF72Su1ciJ9yQGEAKJzg,A.

oversees the financial supportof nike's mission to createground-breakingsport innovations to make moresustainable productsto build a creative and diverse globalteamand to make a positive impact oncommunitiesthat we are so proud of your leadershipin this company that really questionsthe status quoand we are really looking forward tohearing more from youtoday today's conversation will be ledbythree haas mba students each of whomwillintroduce themselves on behalf of all ofus here at berkeley haaswelcome back mattso i want to start us off with aquestion aboutyour time at berkeley i know you were astudent athlete i understand you were apitcherand you were also a haas undergrad soas you reflect back you share aparticular memoryor a highlight from your undergraduateyearwell sure and thank youthank you dean for for having me herei'm super delighted toto have the opportunity to speak to thestudents today in the communityyou know as i think back on my time atcal i think of it pretty fondly becausei feel like it was where i grew upi you know moved away from home i hadthe opportunity to make new friendshipsand many friendships which have stayedwith me forthe more than 20 years since i'vegraduated andi think probably some of the things thatwere most notable to me outside ofplaying sport wasgrabbing my daily cal every day and andand reading it and trying to solve thepothe crossword puzzle and um and uhthe great group related experiences thati got at haasso i enjoyed the classes that i took theteachers that i met and got to knowbut it was really the group activitiesand learning how to work in groups thatreally had apretty profound impact on me andprepared me forum for my future career and i'd neverexperienced anything like thathey matt uh it's so great to be chattingwith you it's really such an honormy name is adithya and i'm aco-president of the haas finance clubas a future investment banker and alifelong nike fanatici'm really excited to be asking you thisquestion sohow would you say your experience as aninvestment bankerprepared you to serve as a cfo of amulti-billion dollar global brandwell i would start by saying that what iwas most focused on when i graduatedfrom haaswas my firstmy first experience working in order tobuild the foundation a solid foundationfor a long-term career in business andafter talking to a number of people iultimately decided thatthat investment banking was the bestpath to go because i figured that itwould help blend accountingcapital markets and valuationum and i probably didn't fullyappreciate how much strategicuh insight and learning i would have asa result ofof working with corporations thinkingabout their businesswhen i translate those experiences towhat probably has helped me the most atnikeis the mindset of being a value creatorum always trying to figure out how tocreate valueum in every business decision that youtakeand the beauty of that type ofperspective if you go back to maybe acouple of things that that our dean saidhere at the startyou sometimes have to make decisionswhen you're in leadership of companythat don't translate into value in thefirst quarter second quarter or even thefirst year that you do itbut if you've got a mindset that has avision forfor what uh what you're trying toaccomplish over multiple yearsum you'll make those decisions becausethey're the right decisions to makefor the long term and i think that thatrooted mindsetin in value and valuation andhow running a business can impact andcreate value for your communities andfor your shareholdersultimately became a an incredible sourceof strategic value for me and runningnikehi matt thank you so much for taking thetime to speak with us todayi'm wyatt davis a second year full-timemba at haasand i will be joining nike this summeras a digital product manager in theconnected marketplace teamso before we jump in could we do a quickkick checkwhat do you got x95 awesomeall right so for my first question uh inaddition to navigating the covidpandemic and the surge in the blmmovement nike has been undergoing amassive organizational transformationfor the past yearwhat personal characteristics andqualities most helped you lead throughthis timeand can you share a mistake or learningmoment you hadsure well i i'll start by saying that iwas named cfoum in february of 2020 and sothe um my experience ofof what i envisioned for my career andstarting my career as cfowasn't ultimately what came to life interms of a global pandemicoccurring about a month and a halfafterwards but it's been a credibleexperiencefrom a learning point of view and umwhat i would say is is thatyou know my first goal and objectivethrough all of thiswas to remain calm and measuredwe have 75 000 employees around theworld we were dealing with the pandemicaffecting our business in different waysin different countries at differenttimesand what our employees needed to see wasa sense ofconfidence and a sense of calmness as wewere assessing everything that was goingonand really trying to set clear directionfor the businessso one of the things that we did at thestart was we wereorganized the company around thisconcept ofof what were the operating and financialmeasuresthat were most important for us to drivesuccess over a six to 12 month periodthose looked very very different than atypical budgeting process or strategyprocess strategic planning processand it created an immense amount offocusand clarity for our teams in terms ofdecision making and uhand driving alignment another thing iwould say is resilienceif all of us haven't learned howimportant it is to be resilientover this past year i would say thatit's incrediblyimportant the circumstances that we'redealing with every day are unpredictableandwe've watched multiple umcircumstances from the pandemic to theissues around racial injustice toum you know to to you know global uh orgeopoliticalyou know challenges and complexities umtoto to the things that we're dealing withhere in our domestic marketsthe reality is is that every day feelslike there'snew things that are on the horizon andumand any plan that you had you had to beprepared toto reassess through a filter of of whatmatters mostto your business and to make thosedecisionsi would say from a human perspective theimportance as a leader of listening toyour teamsum i'll come back and hit my my learninguh ormy mistake that i made but umreally really important to be listeningto your teams and the input of yourteams on the groundand um that really connects prettyclosely to empathyyou know being an empathetic leader evenwhen you don't have all the answerscreating space to be able to have yourteamshare with you um what concerns theyhave what fears they have what isissues they're they're struggling within the midst of being remoteand lacking human interaction and umand how creating that space uh gavepeopleuh confidence in in me as a leaderand um in leadership to get through itand most of those things frank they sumup as humility because we didn't haveall the answerswe didn't know what next week was goingto bring um but our focus and attentionwas ontrying to steer the company in a in adirection thatwas right for people prioritizing safetyand healthfirst and um and tryingtrying to make the right decisionsbecause we knew that for the long termthat nike would be would be okay and umand we had to we had to really focus onthose issues that mattered moston your question about a mistake youknowi i have a tendency to have a high biasfor actionand i think thati think that at the beginning of thepandemicwe were trying to process quickly whatwas happeningand quickly start to direct the teams onthe actions we thought they needed totake in order to try to address theissuesand and the circumstances and what westarted to realize was things wereflying at us faster than we coulddirect out and we were slowing the teamsdown and we weren't empowering them toto be aware of and be on the lookout forwhat was happeningand then to make decisions that theyneeded to make at the local level inorder to be able to winand um and to support the teams and tocare for peopleand um and so pretty quicklyin the in the pandemic we ultimatelydecided that we hadwe had to provide very clear tops downdirection on what thewhat the items were that mattered mostbut really try to provide a lot ofum a lot of space for local leaders tobe able to lead their teamsand to make decisions on the ground thatwould latter up tothose bigger those bigger imperativesfor the companythank you uh for the next questiondespite its size nike operates as ahigh-growth innovativebold and agile company how do youinstill these qualities into the companyculture and your teams on a daily basiswell i think it's a great question ithink it's it's especially important forfor students who are you know who arecontemplating theirlong-term career um you know there's twothings that i personally look forwhen i'm interviewing people to work onmy leadership team and to work within myorganizationone is is it's imperative to have agrowth mindsetand um and that means that you'relearning and want to learnevery day and um i've experiencedworking with people at different pointsthroughout my career where they tend tohavemore of a perspective of i know it and iknow what we need to dorather than a mindset that says i'mconstantly processing andlearning from the people who work aroundme from reading things fromyou know doing checkpoints with otherindustrieshaving broader network and connectionswith your peersjust has a huge impact on the way thatyou canprocess information and then apply it toyour current job andso i'm constantly looking for peoplethat have uh a growth mindset andsecondly people whowho demonstrate a learning agilitybecause you know thethe world is changing rapidly and youknow at nike we've experienced this inthe context of watching the wayconsumer connections with brands to theway that digital has interplayed intoour supply chain to the way it'stransforming retailour business is changing and yet westill pride ourselvesoff of innovation and the products wecreateand and the way that we connectstorytellingwith amazing products for consumers butthe way we operate is a company'sfundamentally changing end to end acrossthe value chainand so if you so you got to have peopleon your teams who demonstrate thisagility toto to to be excited and energized by newways of working and andexploring and challenging the status quoin order to try to take the company to adifferent leveland um it's been really fun for me overthe past 12 years at nike to be on thatjourneyand um and uh i've just i'veyou know it's been fun to be a part ofit and you know we're not done we've gota lot in front of us to do in order toum to continue to to have the kind ofimpact that we think we can have forconsumersum for our communities and ultimatelyyou know that should translate intoshareholder value as wellthank you hey matt my name is tessit's great to virtually meet you i'm afull-time mba student at berkeley haasand the co-president of net impact hereon campusi wanted to ask you a few questionsabout nike's environmental and socialimpactso recently nike announced that it willsell slightly worn footwear and selectstorescould you tell us more about why nikemade that choice and how you anticipatethis will impactnike's operations sustainability goalsand financialsalso are there any other circularsolutions that nike is exploringsure well you know we've we've been onthe front end ofsocial impact and the impact that ourbusiness has on the environment fora long time actually you guys may havemet chuck gatchell at some point in timechuckis uh actually a close friend of mine wemet in the dorms our freshman year atcaland he was a runner and i was a baseballplayer andhe actually ended up at nike before idid working throughour sustainability and impact group soum he was at my wedding i went to hiswedding like we go back a longway and so um there's a close friendshiptherebut um uh you know for us it's alwaysit's been a huge impactin the way that we think about ourbusiness and the responsibility that wehave to the worldwe know that the products we create uhhave an impact on the environment and aswe've gotten to the scale that we haveas a companyum it's sort of thatthat standard you know perspective whichis if you're selling 500 million pairs ayearand you're going to sell 750 millionpairs within the next strategic planningcycle or a billion pairswhat impact is that going to have from acarbon footprint towaste to renewable materials toum you know to the impact on water andbeyondlet alone the employee side of it interms of theeconomies that we're impacting in termsof where we where we create our productand and how we ensure that those thoseemployees and those workers are beingtreated fairly in the environments wherethey're workingin order to create great products thatwe enjoy umthe specific question about therefurbishing is kind of a fun one i'llbe honest becauseas we continue to test and learn at nikeone of the things that we've realized isthat we have to stamp outnike bias when we pursue new businessopportunitiesso this initiative in particularwas something that was tested unbrandedwe had a hypothesis that saidwe have we create a significant amountof waste in our supply chainbut also in when products have me havemet the end of their life cyclebut there's also a lot of product thateither gets returnedbecause because it maybe is defectiveand that gets destroyedbut there's some product that getsreturned that never ends up seeingany usage whatsoever and so we tested abusiness concept which wasis there a price point and a value forconsumers at a lower level where reusedproduct would be a value ratherthan it being destroyed and ending up inlandfill orin some other place that would beterrible for the environmentextending the life cycle of the productand getting full usage out of itwe're also investing and so we're justtesting that i should say in ourin our our factory stores today in northamericaand we're on the front end of seeingwhat the consumer reaction to that isbut it's definitely something thatwe believe is good for the planet andgood forgood for our consumer relationshipswe've also been investing in recyclablematerials i remember back at the worldcup in 2012and then again in sorry in 2010 and thenin2014 where we were making jerseys teenjerseys out of recycledplastic all of a sudden that became notinteresting totalk about anymore even though we hadinnovated that at the beginningso then you translate to flyknit whichwas in our in our footwearthat was created out of recycledplastics i remember going to factoriesin china and watching the way we werecleaning plastic bottles and thenshredding them down and turning theminto yarn and then basically creating amaterialthat was far more sustainable andreusablebut what i'm really excited about todayare some of the products that we've putto market likethe space hippie or cosmic unity andbasketball where we're starting to lookat complete closed-loop creation ofproductwhere they're marching towards the thegoal of being a hundred percentbut still maintaining performanceattributesso that we're creating products that arebetter for the planetbut also will meet a purpose of servinga value for an athleterunning a marathon uh being able tocompete on an nba courtum or otherwise and so for us you knowit'sthese goals and these objectives arepart and parcel with who we are as acompanyand um and something that we're veryproud of in terms ofuh what we've been able to accomplishand and we see so much opportunityahead hopefully you've read our 2025impact report butum clearly setting goals for where weintend to go as a companyum and uh the great opportunities thatwe see in front of usthank youhey it's me again so john donahoe theformer ceoceo of ebay took the role of nike ceolast yearto elevate the company's technologicalaspirationsyou briefly touched on this earlier butwould you now describe nike as amarketing company that's focused onstorytelling and product developmentor would you consider the company as atechnology brandand as a follow-up how are you as thecompany's cfosupporting the uh this transitionwell so yes john was the former ceo ofof ebay he's the chairman of the boardof paypalum he's he was the ceo of servicenowif you've heard of that company um andhe'd been on nike's board for about fiveyearsbut the transition that we've beenmaking um actually has been enabled bytechnologyand so we communicated a strategy as acompany about four years agothat we called the consumer direct uhthe consumer direct strategyand basically what we realized was thattechnology was enabling niketo um create direct connections withconsumers in ways that we werepreviously unable to doworking through retail partners whocould disintermediate usand through large media networks andpeople who owned media channelswho also dis intermediated us fromconsumersin terms of being able to communicatedirectly with themand uh and to make it a two-waycommunicationwhen the pandemic hit we realized thatshopping behaviors were changingfundamentallyand so we saw an opportunity for us toeven shift and reallocate resources moreintentionallyto be able to accelerate this digitalstrategybecause we our hypothesis was that umsome of the largest retailers in thecountrylike well i don't need to mention namesbut you know who they are the largestretailerwe're only going to become more powerfuland did we want to just tradethe relationships that we had withsmaller retailersum for uh working with larger retailpartners or did we want to invest ourresources to try to create those directconnections with consumersat a greater scale and that's what wechose because we felt like that wasgoing to create greater long-term valueand we also believed that as a brandthat we were one[Music]of the few companies that had theability to take a business that was over40 billion in revenue built under oneset ofhypotheses and beliefs to say that wecould shift resources and focuscompany attention and actually be ableto transitionand capture more value in therelationship with consumersand change the profile of our businessso that's what we've been underunder foot for a while um literallyunderfoot but that's what we've beenunderundertaking for several years and umi think i mentioned you know in a priorpart of the conversationproduct innovation and product andstorytellingis what makes nike special we could havethe bestmobile app we could have the bestdigital commerce relationshipbut if we didn't have great productsthat consumers wanted it wouldn't matterright and so because we're not justbuilding a platform to sellmultiple products we're building atighter and more intentionalrelationship with conconsumers and so what we've done throughthe pandemic and even beyond what i'vebeen focused on in my roleis ensuring that we're investingmaniacally behindproduct innovation sustainabilityand then ultimately creating thesedigital a digital platformthat enables us to have those one-to-oneconnections withconsumers at scale personalizationleveraging data analyticsmachine learning so that we can readpatterns and consumer behaviorwe're employing data and analoganalytics capabilitiesin our supply chain so we know how tomore smartly flow ourproduct where to put our productum the net benefit of that is highermargins because we have less wasteless markdowns less inefficiency andwhere productsits around the world um it also enablesus to ensure that we're more closelycorrelatingour carbon footprint with the movementof goods and services so that weactually are getting value out of itversus you know when i joined nikeyou'd have somebody in marketing wouldsay hey i gotta have a million units onhand at this location by this dateso you put on an airplane but then youturned out that you realize that youonly sold 20of those products in the first two weeksbut you spent the money putting it on anairplane and had the negative carbonimpactwhen you could have put it in adifferent mode to get the product tomarket and you could have had a betterenvironmental impact and better marginsand so it's that type of work andthinking that we're trying to drive atthe company in order to try to optimizeum you know optimize all of thesedifferent elements of our focus andattentionwe are clearly really going to be atechnology companybut it's not in place of product andstorytelling and innovation and productbut we believe that for us to berelevantin a world where we're seeing more andmore consolidation ofplatforms you know consumers arespending the majority of their timeshopping in five or six locationsthey're using10 apps or less to engage on a dailybasisyou know with their friends and familythe reality is is thatwe have to leverage our scale but thebig opportunity for nike is how weresponsibly leverage the data thatconsumers give to usso that we can and so that we can servethem in more personalized waysand create reasons for them to want toengage with our brandmore consistently as opposed to it beingyou know a less informed less bespoketype of business which is which isyou know the way that nike was wasoriginally createdand um and succeeded so a lot of changeof foot at the company but technology isanand for us and we see it as a hugeopportunitygreat thanks matt i actually want to diga little deeper into the nike directstrategyand so nike's been investing heavily inthis channel and it is alsowidely recognized now as the leader indtc during the coven 19 pandemicso you talked about how nike is going tocontinue growing this strategyin the post-pandemic world but what doesthis mean for the company's flagshipbrick and mortar stores wellwhat it means is we're going to havemore of them so we've built our businessprimarily throughwholesale partners you know the bigretailers that you think of foot lockersmacy'sum you know if you remember dick'ssporting goods you knowwe have all of these partners andseveral of them will continue to beimportant strategic partners for usbut one of the things that wecommunicated a couple of quarters agois that we need a larger store footprintwe need a larger a larger storefootprint so that we can becloser in proximity to our consumersaround the uswe believe that that's going to enableus to create betteronline to offline connection pointsthat are very difficult for us to dobetween our own digital platform andwholesalephysical retail platform and so you'regoing to see us openyou know 150 to 200 stores in the unitedstatesand that number continues that's whatwe've communicated publiclybut we continue to reassess andre-evaluate that number as we seeconsumer interest and desire to be moreclosely connected to nike these aren'tgoing to be like the nike towns that youexperience if you visited you know fifthavenue or you've been in new yorkor in london or or in other places likethatwe're talking about smaller footprintstores that are more digitally enabledso a smaller footprintsmaller back of house more leveragingdigital capabilities and a single sourceof inventory supplyso that we can um so that we can servedemand that consumers havebut also create places where people cancome and engage with the brandum where they can participate inactivitieswhich has been very successful for usand then ultimatelyum you know take care of their theirconsumer eliminating consumer frictionsthat exist when people buynike product so you're going to see morestores from nikeand you're going to see them you'regoing to see thempositioned in the marketplace in a waythatthat that reprofiles the way thatconsumers are engaging with brandsand with that we're excited because itenables us to control our storytellingbut also to create a more consistentexperience for consumersso that when they're buying our productsthey know that they're authenticthey have that connection point um andthey're recognized as aas a and the consumers are recognized asmembers of our brand anduh and our companythank you matt um i'm just popping backin sonike is known for its work in socialjustice can you tell us more about whatnike is doing both internally andexternally to support underrepresentedcommunitieswell um i'm going to start by sharingsomething thatuh that that we say a lot internally atnike andyou you may have you may have heard thisthis analogyother places but um it's been reallyinteresting for me over my 12 years ofbeingat nike to see the way that ourperspectives and our valuesinform the way we connect with consumershow weinvest and the way that we use ourresources in order to be able tocontinue to try to have a positiveimpact oncommunities and the world so we'vealways been focused on equalityand you've heard us you know throughdifferent uh advertising campaignsdo that and it's because we felt likethe voice of the athlete needed to beamplifiedwith that message our athletes caredabout itand so it was core to our values and whowe areand so we we wanted to use our brand andour platform as a megaphoneto be able to say sport by definitionshould befair it should be equal there should benobody who's discriminated against forin wanting to play and i'll never forgetour old ceoused to say this is it was the greatequalizer it was the bestathlete should be the one who wins therace oror you know scores the winning thewinning goalor etcetera and so it's something that'spretty inherent to usbut as we've talked with our consumersand also our athletes our athletesin particular are are our heroines tosome degree and many of themare black and we took a point of viewthatit said that we have got to help toamplify that voice in a meaningful wayum so that we can address some of theissues that existin in sport and then we're broadly insociety in our communitieswe've invested money we've uh in insupport against racial justice but thatif you if that's all it is itmeans hollow and so what um you know weinvest a certain percentage uh two and ahalf percent of ourof our income against initiatives andequality and sport in these other placesum but we have this saying internallythat which is cum sorry say bedo so we need to you know we need tomake sure across that spectrum if youthink about it it's reallyeasy to say hey this is important it's amarketing campaignthe b is really about internally at nikeis the employee's experience in ourcommunities experience within nikeconsistent with what we're sayingand then our actions the things that wechoose to do on a day and day out basisboth internally and externallyfollowing the thread of what we'resaying becauseit would be inauthentic if we saidbut we never weren't living that wayinternally and our actions didn't followwhat we said was important to us and sowe use that frame and we've been usingthat frame over the pastyear especially as issues have spikedand um and there's been more focus andattention on it to make sure that aswe're making decisions about what wesay what we do and where we do itthat it's consistent with our values butthat it's consistent withwith um our behavior and if it's notthen we should sit back and we shouldfix our behavior before we say somethingabout it because it isn't just aboutthe message it's about living our valuesandand our communities and and and ouremployeesand consumers seeing us actingconsistently all the way throughthank you matt um and kind of in asimilar uhvein so a question about supply chainsat niketraceability and transparency andapparel supply chains arecons a constant challenge could youspeak to the work that nike is doing toensurea just and sustainable supply chain andas well nike's role in the broaderindustry in shaping policy andregulationsure well this is a hot topic today andso i'm going to answer the question butit might sound like i'mi'm tiptoeing around around elements ofitum but uh but we believe we should be aleaderin this space and it's one of thereasons why we clearly communicate ourvalues in our impact reportas it relates to the way that we um theway that we responsibly source andsupplyproduct in our supply chain we continueto invest in traceabilityum we we're investing heavily inin like our audit function and the waysthat we follow where we sourceproduct and what we do and we'reconstantly making decisionsabout that that have a negativeconsequence on our profit marginsso a long time ago we made the decisionthat we were going to do what was rightand if it had a negative impact on ourgross margins then it had a negativeimpact on our gross marginsand i know that we chose to stand outand take that leadership positionbecause it was the right thing to do andit doesn't just pertain to forced labororum or other relate or other elements ofthe supply chain that mightdrive down the cost of product it alsopertains tosustainability related measures you knowso so the types of products that we putin our prthe types of materials we put in ourproduct or where we sourcelabor may not be the cheapest um but wedo it because of our valuesand because it's the right thing to doand so we've been making those decisionsfor yearswhen we made our when we put our impactreport out we were very clear aboutthe the efforts that we've put intoplace around traceabilityand we feel very confident um about theactions that we're taking and what we'redoingin terms of the quality of the materialsandum the ways in which those materials areharvested to come into our products but we also recognizefrom a sustainability point of viewthat like i gave you that analogy beforeif you're selling500 500 million pairs of footwear to 750to a billionyou realize that at some point you haveto come up with different ways ofof of creating new materialsinnovation and new materials orinnovations and methods of make ofproductbecause it's just not sustainable toassume that you could the line justcontinues to go up and to the right interms of the impact it hason the ecosystem of materials or laborin certain certain places around theworldso we're investing heavily in newmethods of make of productand in new material sourcesin order to ensure that we're creatingsustainability in in those in thoseareas in which we make productbut it's this is of utmost importance tous and we believeit's intersected with our brand in otherwords if you could makei'll just be really blunt we could makemore money making different decisionsbut we choose to make these becausethey're the right decisions for theplanetand they're the right decisions for ourbrand and at this point those things areinextricably linkedthank you for sharingum so you touched on leading withhumility a bit earlierand as a nike intern last summer i sawleaders show an exceptionalexceptional amount of flexibility andempathy as we all navigated a reallychallenging yeartoday we expect leaders to takeresponsibility not only for employeelivelihood but also for employee liveshow do you see this shifttoward compassionate leadership evolvingover time and how can we prepareourselves to be successful leaders inthe futureit's a great question and i think thislast year has reallytested leadership in so many waysyou know i think since i've been uh aprofessional for the past20 coming up on 22 yearsthe number of leadership books andmodels that i've seen employed that werepopularuh they've probably turned over two orthree times you know there'sbeen different fads and and suggestionsabout what makes a successful leaderbut i think we have a confluence ofevents at this point in time that arereally kind of putting pressure onthe traditional norms of what peopleview as leadersand whether it's you know because iremember when i came out it wasthe big debate was is leadershipsomething you're born with or is itsomething you can learn andand how does that how does that evolveover timeum i fundamentally believe that it'ssomething that you can learnand it's something that you have theopportunity to demonstrateevery day no matter how big your team isor what environment you're operating ini think it starts with knowing your ownpersonal valuesyou have to look within and know whatyour values arebecause they are what's uh what'sspecific to youand if you can can draw strengthfrom your own values you will be a moreauthentic leaderas you engage with the teams than thepeople that you work withif you feel like you're just kind ofyou know you knowcommunicating the corporate parlance orwhatever you know that the corporate uhline um you will you will hit a road atsome point in time wherewhere you feel like it's really hard foryou to go furtherbecause you're you're being asked tolead in a way thatis not consistent with your own values ithink this last year really testedpeople because i'm not sureeverybody would have communicated theirvalues the same way so if you thinkabout it from the pandemicand the isolation and the fear overdeath and the anxiety over beingseparated from people we were allseparated from communities prettyquickly andwhether it was your you know your yourschool communityor your you know like from in my case itwas my kid's school community or it wasyour work environment oryour churches or your mosques orwhatever it would beum or even remember people were afraidto go walk outsideat the beginning of the pandemic and sowe were really cut offand um and then we had the issues youknow that that started to elevate withyou know with george floyd and racialinjustice and the way that these otherissues cameupon us and the election and all ofthese thingsthings that it it's it forced us all tosort of i think look deep withinand figure out what it was that reallycaused us to be in the positions thatwe're in and what we really wantedout of our personal and our professionalrelationshipsand while everybody might not havecommunicated a umyou know a consistent set of valuesacross i'm going to tell you my point ofview and my point of view is is i'm moreoptimisticthan maybe what you read if you justread the headlines in the paper everyday becausewhat i'm seeing is uh i'm not seeing a50 50. i'm seeing more of aa a shared value for people andtreating people respectfully andrecognizing people for who they areand ensuring that people have theopportunity tobring the best of themselves to workevery dayand to me that's not a 50 50 you'reeither in it or you're notthat's a 90 10. and i'm seeing more andmore peoplein that 90 percent in the middlesaying yeah of course that makes senseand that's that'sfor the good of each other and and uhand and for mankind and umand for me that gives me a lot ofoptimism as i look at thewhat we're trying to create and whatwe're trying to do and like i saidearlier on in the conversation wyatt youknow my perspective is thatthese issues are tough issues that we'redealing with andlistening as a leader and showingempathy even when you don't have theanswers is soimportant because especially becausewe're so isolated todayyou don't know how all of these issuesare impacting everybody on your teamand it would be arrogant to assume thatyou do and socreating that space to be able to listenand to hear and to know that you don'talways have the answers but to be ableto put an arm around somebodyand to let them know that you hear themand and that you're processing what theywhat they've told you and you're tryingto figure outhow you can be supportive of them in thecontext of what they're going throughit goes in my experience so far and iknow i'm still young but it'si'm seeing it go have a very favorableimpact and at the end of the day for youthat are graduating from haas you aspireto be a leaderjust one day you aspire to have peoplefollow youand um and you aspire to have people andyou aspire to have an impact on theworldand how you do that is is a question ofhow you get people to follow youfollowership how do you get people tofollow you and your ideas and yourthoughtsand what they want is they want to getto know youand if they can get to know you they cansee where that shared value is andwhen you start to to give them visionand direction for where you want to leadand where you want to goyou've created a connection with them ina different way than justa traditional boss to employee orpeer-to-peer relationship you'veyou've created a connection that's builton something that's more solid than thatmatt thank you so much umthat is so powerful and it reallyresonates withso many of us listening to you umthat that concludes uh our our studentquestionand i really want to thank our studentstessand i and dtf for really powerfulquestions andmatt thank you so much for your candorand your honesty and your humility andyour brilliance we really appreciate itum so much and we're so proud to callyou an alumnow we're going to transition to somequestions from the audienceum so if that's okay i'll start with thefirst oneso this one is from patrick covinoso patrick writes as cfocan you speak a bit more about how youthinkthrough and ultimately make decisionsrelated to technology investments andinvestments in talentso for example how do you make adecision about hiring an engineerversus hiring people in salesit's a good question and uhand one of the biggest responsibilitiesi have at the company isto help develop our strategyfirst and foremost and ensure that we'vegot clearmeasures and metrics that tell us on amonthly and quarterly and annual basiswhether we're making progress againstour strategybut secondly how we allocate resourcesacross the companyso one of the biggest elements of my jobis cap is our capital planningand ultimately where we choose to investin order to drive our long-term strategyand our returnsum usually the the distinction isn't soclearin terms of an engineer versus the salesperson umuh but often times it around those bigboulders of strategywhere you're trying to make significantshifts in where the company is going tohave impactas you look three to five years out anddetermining what resources are requiredi have to use the skills that i learnedat haas and the skills that i learned ininvestmentbanking to evaluate roi of the decisionsthat we take and so you know our teamhas responsibility for helping to builda business case and to be clear onwhat's really required and how we paceand phase those investments so that weensure that we're building and drivingretentionand um and uh and and a return oninvestment over time but we also spend alot of time talking about the way thatour workforce is changing so if i getspecific to hryou know we're constantly havingconversations about the way thattechnology is changing our workforceand what people who are graduating fromhaas todayexpect in the work environment and whatskills and experiences and tools theybringrelative to maybe what it was like wheni graduated i mean i remember when igraduated in 99i got a desktop computer there was nolaptop there were no mobile phones yetor at least maybe like the partner on onthe team had a mobile phone but none ofus had mobile phoneswe had pagers in order to connect andand to be found when they neededus and so the world has changed a lotin 20-something years but i spent a lotof timeconnecting those decisions to ourstrategy and then we built our resourceplans against itso everything starts with a very clearvision and strategic plan of where we'regoing as a companyand then we build our business plansunderneath itso that we ensure that we're allocatingour resourceresources and we're and we're aligningthe goals and the objectives of thebroader organization againstachieving that long-term strategythanks matt that that makes so muchsense umthe next question isum anand would love to know nike'sdecision-making process when it comesto backing a respective athleteum as a consumer anon loved how nikebackeduh kaepernick up but what were themetrics or discussion pointswell i wish i could i could assure youthat it waslike a scientific processsometimes it is and sometimes it is aconversation across four or five of uson the leadership teamdeciding whether we think this is theright thing for us to do at this pointin timein in the moment umwhat we always come back to are ourthree corevalues okay our three core values as acompany are equalityum access to sport for youth and theplanetand those are the three lenses that weputon these different social issues as theycome upand we talk about whether speaking tothese issues isis uniquely nike's position or whetherit's just a corporation thathas a lot of resources and a brandthat's recognized and we're just talkingto a matter becauseit's a hot topic for today so we reallytry to use that filter of those threesubjectsin order to determine whether it'suniquely important for niketo speak at this particular point intime or notand then i think the last thing i wouldsay just goes back to what i mentionedin a priorin the prior chat which is that beuh that say be do becauseif we don't believe that we're behavingthis wayinternally then we shouldn't be outspeaking about it just because we canbecause we feel like that's notauthentic to who we arethank you for that um thank you uhnow we have a question from jeff diamondjeff asks what are the most importantproduct areas that nike is focusing onto transform traditional productsinto sustainable productswell it's mostly in the materials spaceso umwhen we look at our products we havewe have two big drivers of the cost ofour product that also have animpact on the environment in which weoperateyou can maybe argue three but it's it'smaterials and the cost of materialsand the accessibility of materials in aworld where there's more and more demandfor nikeand for other consumer brands that aretrying tofully get access to those materials toput in their productand then the second piece is labor andyou could say well is laborlabor is a quantity of um or aquantification ofthe amount of labor that's used in aproduct and the ratewe focus on the amount of product oflabor that's made in a proproduct which forces us to innovate innew ways of manufacturingso that we don't have to rely upon asmuch human labor to be able to createour productsso we're focused on technology and theway technology enables us to innovatethe way products are madeso that we don't have so that we don'thave to constantly rely upon moreum more labor uh to make our productsand then we're constantly focused on theinnovation of the way thatwhat we put into our products so thatwe're not constantly depleting theworld's water resourcesor relying upon differentelements of the make of materials likecotton andother chemicals and things that havehistorically gone into the products thatwe makewhich are not great for the environmentso those products that i referenced inour prior conversation whether it wasthe space hippieor cosmic unity um as examples ofproducts most recently that aresustainable or what we're doing inapparelwe're focused very heavily on thatmaterials element of what goes into ourproductso that we can try to close the loop ofwhat we're doing so that at some pointin theory we could either take wastefrom other industriesand transform that into materials thatgo into our productsor we can take back the products thatwe've made and have been usedand revert them back to their to a to ato a sourcethat we can then utilize in our productsthanks so much matt that's sointeresting umand that's very much what you've beenfocusing on is very much consistent withmy three priorities uh leading haaswhich has beeninnovation inclusion and sustainabilityso thateverything that you're saying resonatesso much so now we have a question that'squite differenton a totally different note from waleedhamidasks what are the top three skills thatyou learned athaas that helped you navigate thedifferentcareers and positions that you've hadwell i i would say that the three wouldbeum one as i mentioned at the starti had never had the opportunity at leastat my time at caland before to work in groupsand that teamwork that gets created fromworking in groupsand making mistakes this worked thisdidn'twho took the lead who who volunteered totake on a certain responsibilitythat was all new muscle for me butincredibly valuable as i got out intothe working world because you'realways you'll never not work on a teamagain might seem like you're at timesan individual contributor but you willnever not be part of a teamyou know as you work towards the futureand so that was hugely valuablethe second was humility because i wassurrounded by incredibly smart peopleand i was grateful every day that i wasin classbut i also got to see sometimes wherepeople's pride and arrogance sort oflike took him in a direction that didn'twant people to follow him and i thoughtto myselfyou know what there's a different waythat i want to engageand and and be a part of a team versusumand be part of the team versus standingout and maybe trying to show everybodythat you know the answers to everythingor otherwise and soit wasn't that i got the experience buti got to witness it andit had an impact on me in terms of interms of what i was doingand then the third thing i would justsay is you're building an incrediblenetworkat haas and those relationships andthose connection points are so importantand you'll be tempted as you go to workin a new companyas you graduate to focus on what thatcompany doesand i would just encourage you to stayopen and listen and stay connectedbecauseyou learn so much from challenges andobstacles that other industries faceand their company's face other peersface and you canyou can shamelessly borrow thoseexperiences andapply them to what you're going throughat any given point in timeand figure out how you might respond tothe situation and uhand you know i was fortunate to have alot of haasalums working at goldman and morganstanley over my time of being therebut honestly when i got to nike i gotnike has a tendency to be a little bitinsular in terms of like we make it herewe do this hereand so i went for a while kind of likegoing dim on my networkand in hindsight and i wish i didn't letthat happenand i've had to amp it back up in mymore senior roles at the company becauseyou just realizeyou can't figure it all out here you canleverage the relationships and theconnection pointsto help influence what you're trying toaccomplishthanks thanks so much it's great to hearthat you're amping backup your your haas network we're reallyexcited to hear that umthis is actually we only have time forone last questionum and this is a question from jezreelboadleyum jezreel asks can you share any advicethat you might havefor undergraduates who are about tograduateand enter the working worldwell what i would say is is focuson finding mentors and people who aregoing to take aninterest in your career development forthe long termwhen you make that first decision to goworkyou're going to be balancing a decisionof a brand value of a companyor people who you feel like you're youcan connect withand follow and have and and learn andgrow and develop fromand i would just say that as you buildyour careerit's finding those people who championand support youand your development long termwill be the most impact from you but ifyou fast forward 20 years and you lookbacki assure you that you won't talk aboutthe names of the companiesas like the how i got here you'll talkabout the peoplewho you worked with who gave youopportunitieswho invested in you who challenged youto think about things in different waysthat enabled you to get to where you areand umthe sooner you you learn that and youprocess thati think it gives you perspective as yougo through the first hard years ofworking when you're out on your ownthank you so much so for everyone wehavejust heard from matt friend the chieffinancialofficer executive vice president at nikeand a haas graduate umthank you so much matt and thanks to ourwonderful students for their questionsthis has been a reallygreat opportunity to hear from you todayappreciate itthanks for having

hi so how do you tell the differencebetween an authentic 4-port opportunityor a fake one so today I'm going to showyou an authentic Barcelona 2015 2016Jersey that I bought online from areputable place versus a fake one that Ibought in laughs now one of the keydifferences obviously is going to beprice so that looks too good to be trueit probably isfor example this Jersey cost 150 USdollars online and the fake one was wasless than 10 US dollars at a store inLaos the other thing is going to be thefit of it so Mike actually makes twodifferent versions themselves it'salmost like they rip themselves off theymake what they call the the match orperformance or player shoe which isbasically the same Jersey that theplayers wear on the pitch and then theymake one that they call Stadium which isfor the fans it's cheaper it's alsobigger so this the match one is atighter fit for athletic bodies I preferthat being a fairly fit person the Ifind that the size small in theirstadium version is is too big in a bitbaggy whereas this is so small in the inthe match version as you can see it fitsquite snug and tightly you know I'll putthe Y over on to show you the differenceokay so this is the fake the knockoffversion of the of the Barcelona awayJersey obviously the one I was wearingwas their their home jersey and this isa knockoff of the authentic or or asMike calls it the match Jersey and asyou can see it's a lot more baggy that'snot quite as quite a fit it's probablyit probably is still a tighter tighterfit than the Mike official stadiumversion cuz I mean they're even biggerstill but I'm going to show you a fewmore detail differences as well okay sothe main differences between thesequality andpurely used and if you had a littletricks that I'll show you as welland it's also going to pen on the thequality of the paper this is a prettygood quality fake but it's actually Isuppose more similar to like stone ripoff the stadium version then the actualauthentic version on the 2015 version ofthe night soccer or football jerseysthey have these ventilation holes in theback seal is now on the real stadium orhome sorry the real match version youcan see that these five holes at theback of all got a lining to reinforceand strengthen them and the same withthe holes on the sleeve the other thingyou'll notice is that there's differentmaterial so if you hold hold this up tothe light you can see see through thismaterial here on the inside it's a bitof quite hollow weave for aeration andit's actually going to a differentmaterial at the top here at the back ofthe neck so it still has the holes butas you can see there's no noreinforcement around those holes on theinside there's the holes and also thethe fabric is pretty much the samefabric at the top here as it is downhere it's not you can't see through itas easily how does a lot of aerated onthe authentic match version you can seethey've got an extra layer of it's likea film here that goes over the seam soit's like a heat press seam it's notstitched this is on the inside of thecollar where is on on the knockoff youknow you've just got stitching thereas you can see the difference betweenthe the yellow knockoff here and theauthentic mic one here also if you lookat the stitching on the band down theside so the originals or the authenticmic one has got it doubled overstitching it's quite neat and tidywhereas the fete completely differentit's a much cheaper type of teaching nowthe other thing is the type of materialits use down this side on the fakeversion it's the same material all theway down all the way to the sleevewhereas on the the real like oneit starts with similar sort of materialbut then the holes get bigger as youmake your way to the sleeve then they'requite large holes there and again hereyou can see that material on the sleevesis slightly different to the material onthe shirt itself another thing is thestitching just around the whole outsideso this is the the bottom of the Jerseyso you can see it's got two two rows ofstitching their particular style but thefabric is just being cut and thestitching put across whereas on theauthentic one the to do it's only onerow of stitching but the fabrics beingfolded under and stitched along so itleaves a lot smoother and it's not gonnafray and that's along the bottom andalso the same thing around the sleevesit's being folded under there's on thesleeves of the fake again it's justbeing cut off so you can see that littleflap there another good point is thetags so on this tag you'll see this isthe authentic one the numbers on herethe style the color number andnow if you look at the tag on the insideof the jersey so it's got that same samenumber they're the six five eight sevennine zero and the four two two and it'sgot the s up there for small inside someof the ones I've seen do it's just gotthese larger tags yes another feature isthese authentic tags that night puts onhere so on the match versions then likeauthentic tags are gold on the stadiumversions they're actually silver now oneof the key differences you can see hereis that the fake ones actually stitchedon whereas the authentic ones actuallyheat pressed on the numbers are similarthis is sort of like a realistic numberso it looks like it could be real if thenumbers are too low then it could be afake as well the other thing I noticedwas that when I was in the store Ipicked up this Jersey I compared thisnumber on here against some otherjerseys that they had there there was aParis Milan Jersey and actually had theexact same number so that you know theforgers are going to make one of thesetags with the exact same number butprint heaps of them and put them on allthe tracks so if you if you're gettingonline you can't necessarily look at allwe have the jerseys there but if they'vegot photographs of the tags then youmight get a tell if they're all the samenumber across different clubs then thatobviously means they're fake now thematerial that's used in this fake is isprobably similar in feel to thematerials used in Mike's stadium versionso don't get confused between this andthe and the official mack stadiumversion because the night stadiumversion is the same material down theinside here as well rather than havingthe changes on on the match version okayso if we go to the logo itself noticethey both look very similar in this casethe I think the yellow here on the onthe fake is a bit off it's a bitbrighter than it is on the authenticMike one other thing is that it's it'squite soft and thin it's really easy tofold hasn't got a lot of stiffness to itwhereas the authentic ones got quite abit of stiffness and bulk to it otherthing is the the printing on the shirtso this is the Qatar Airways logono it's it's quite thin as well and itdoesn't have any little plastic coatingover it it's quite easy to fold whereasthe on the authentic one if you lookclosely it's got a little clear plasticcoating around the edge and it's quitestiff so that it's not folding as easilyit's quite thick and that's the same onthe sleeves so the logo on the sleevethe same sort of thing look at thatclosely you can see the the clear bitover the top is a quite smooth and yeahthe UNICEF logo on the backso it's the stiffer feel I'm comparisonto the the fake it's quite soft okay soanother thing to note is the quality ofour stitching inside the neck so insideyeah you can see that inside the neck atthe front this is the authentic versiondoes it's got the stitching around thetop here but the folded Euler piece offabric is actually glued or heat bondedtogether there you can see a little bitof some sort of plastic in material overthe edge there whereas on the fake youknow it's different stitching up herebut this is just folded over it's reallynot a poor quality in comparisonstitching the fake you know thestitching there is quite thick and solidbut there's not much of a gap betweenthe letters whereas the the authenticit's actually a finer stitched in thereit's thicker and it's got a bit of aspace between it so it's see the twoside-by-side you can see that theauthentic blue one there it's a bit of athinner stitching as far as the boldnessof the the letters themselves and a bitmore of a gap between the letters okayso another thing on the authentic one onthe sleeve here sorryfrom so then on the inside snow putthere well so you've got the dots acrosson the sleeve and on this one youactually got a hole this one thatactually got a whole panel stitched onhere whereas with the authentic one it'sthe same piece of fabric let's just gotthe darts in there on the peg on thesleeve it's a separate panel just inthere so yeah those are the maindifferences don't get confused betweenthe knife match and the knife stadiumbut this is a official knife matchplayer issue and this is a knockoff Mikematch issue so those are the sorts ofthings to look for when you're trying tospot a fake like soccer or footballjersey so I hope this video has beenhelpful to you thanks for watching,22,UCQeobtYr-QjGBa1whSHmr5Q,AP Designs,321,83,0,590,"['nike sneaker online bot', 'bot', 'sneaker',

for over a decadeand he will be walking us through how tohydro dip shoes the right way before weget into it Akeem explains why sneakercustomization is on the rise when itcomes a customization people want to geta custom that is unlike anything anybodyelse to see so we we create one of onecustomers you know you want to stand outyou don't want to blend in with everyoneelse so you come to us and then we canbring you bring the light almost anyyeah so the purpose of this video is tohydrate definition right yeah it is alsosomething that's very unique and rarethe way that we're going to show it sowhat I want to do now is just head onout to the car and actually get thiswhole thing startedto start the hydrogen process werecommend you head over to a hardwarestore like Lowe's to pick up thematerials to accomplish this you'regonna need a 10 gallon clear bucketmasking tape clear coat and an exactoknife the hydro dip activator isactually the only thing we have to buyonline and we'll link it in thedescription of the video this is thehydrographic film that we're going to beused to dip the Air Force one this is adesign inspired by takashi i'm sure tothe man who actually came up yet madethis vector for us yet in collaborationfor what sure we use we're going to beusing the classic Air Force one they'remade that's fresh so then I'm just goingto dip the whole shoe or what do youknow you're not going to dip the wholeshoe you know create a design you knowsomething that will resemble an officialNike mmm-hmm you know anything you wantI can actually steal our ideas give uscredit for what he got ideas of how youcan actually dipper Air Force One sothis is like way different because a lotof the Hydra dip hyper dipping videosout there just they just dump the entireshoe yeah I've never actually seensomething to do something custom likewhat Kings about to do yeah you guys aregonna want to check this outso the first step to doing any custom isprepping the shoe taking out the lacesis included and prepping but you want toprep removing the entire factoryfinished from the leather just to makesure your paint or whatever rapid youhave can adhere to the surface you canaccomplish this task by actually usingacetone and a cotton rag alright movingon to the next step you're gonna needsandpaper prefer 1500 grit is very verysmoothwe're gonna use the sandpaper to add alittle bit of texture so that the filmwill stick a little bit better and bevery careful not to sand too much orelse you could damage the leather on theshoe the second step is called a maskingprocess now look in the masking processit's essentially going to tape off theareas that you do not want thehydrographic design to print onalright masking is also important tokeep the shoe from getting wet by usinga plastic bag you can ensure that thedesign only goes in the areas that youwant as well as prevent any water fromgoing inside this will allow you totransition into these next steps moreefficiently and get custom shoes out alot quickerstep three is preparing the tank alrightguys this is gonna be important the nextstep in the process is to actually getyour water filled up in the tank thatyou purchased now it's gonna beimportant that you guys use warm wateras the hydrographic activator that weuse requires water that is around 86degrees Fahrenheit now this is gonna beimportant guys because if you get thewater too hot it's not gonna adherecorrectly and if you get it too cold thesame thing happens so you want to makesure that your temperatures are nice andmore importantly you're also gonna wantto make sure that you test the filmbefore applying it to the final productI recommend you guys use some productlaying around the house that allows youto test it and dip the process andensure that it's actually gonna stick toit before you startdumping you the shoes that you spent somuch time preparing make sure that youguys use clean water as often as you canbetween each dip this is amazing thankyou chose one into just making sure thatwe're gonna get this design on thischecker and on this shoe that design onjust the backside so I'm excited to sayso now we're in now we're about to dipget ready to dip and we want to makesure that we size our fill to correlatewhat the size of the panel that you'llbe dipping we won't need this entirefilm so we're gonna cut it in half justto make sure we don't waste it tape thefilm firmly to something that you don'twant the exacto knife to damage like thelid that came from this tank tape eachside of the film and cut it accordinglynow a bonus tip here is to just kind ofleave a little slit in between two orthree sides of the tape which will allowthe film to expand and better adhere toyour product[Music]after letting the film hydrate for about60 seconds apply the activator you willsee the film turn into a glassyappearance and now comes the fun partnow you're gonna want to make sure thatyou take your time here guys don't rushthis process and you're gonna want toaim it correctly to Center yourplacement of the design now a key hereis to just make sure you look at whichdirection the design is going so youdon't get the smiley faces or a certaindesign upside down or going in the wrongdirection patience is important hereguys think about it test it on anotherproduct before you dip the final designI want to make sure that you remove themasking quickly being careful not to getany of the excess hydrographic design ona part of the shoe that you don't wantby removing the bag carefully it alsoprevents you from spilling liquid intothe shoe which will delay your hydrodipping process now you want to let theshoe dry between each dip all right it'sgonna be important that you do this inorder to let the shoe fully heal beforedunking it into water againnow this last part is completelyoptional but it will allow you to trulycreate a one-of-a-kind some tips herewhen it comes to the using the Nike AirForce one consider painting the air logoperhaps the actual font and even thestitching this will allow you tocoordinate with the customization thatyou did through the hydrogen engine allright you guys now the final step ofthis process is to protect the designusing the clear coat you're gonna evenlyspray it onto all the areas that you putyour art all right this is gonna ensurethat your art stays for life and yourcustomers are

have a BAE not right nowbut after she tastes it she will be gayyou feel me how long have you been awareof nutrition as far as functionality hestarted playing golf at 4 I know it foryou weren't thinking about nutrition andno I mean carbs no like 20 years agothere's nothing there wasn't much aboutnutritiongrowing up I was quite the chunky kidfast food was my main source oh that'sbecause parents didn't know we didn'tknow we thought you know it's all it'sall good for you and then I got injuredI was 17 I broke you know three bones inmy left hand and end up taking you knowa lot of you know painkillers to playthe doctor prescribed me but I was likeyoung and I end up getting an ulcer hmmso since then I've been very aware aboutwhat I put into my body that created allthese like food sensitivities just morethan digesting things the same way andthen I started realizing I need to eatbetter I need to actually pay attentionwhat I put into my body I was soinflamed I need to do things to decreaseinflammationI'm just why I started to eat like thisand then I got really really strict Ialmost got like too strict Mo's writingthings down everything I ate almost gotlike a little bit too obsessed with itby writing what the fat in the car yeahcalories a little journal exactly it'sjust too much so now I'm like trying tofind like a good balance of just beingaware you can get stuck in a you know aphase where you eat bad and your bodyfeels bad but then you're like ignoringthe signs they're ignoring your bodycommunicating whereas if you listen toit then you can kind of get your back ontrack and if you are on track you feelgreat this one is specifically for youwhy you saw and what looks ten hands onhips dobeing a sports person being in the gameis all about how can you make it betterfor the next generation and to go offhas such a stigma but the way I knowit's such a cool sport and having itbeing the Olympics was a big step justbecause it opens a game up to so manycountries I haven't even been in thegame before and because if you thinkabout it people that just start golfwhere do they even start so I want toyou know inform people a fun place sothere's golf courses where my friendsbrings our dogs to or you know like canbring their kids to so if we could makethat a little bit easier and moreaccessible hmm I think that we can get alot more people into the game you saw mecooking I just like feel it you know andthen oh how I play golf as well too Imean you know you know if you have theright club in your hand like you knowyeah and you have to make a consciousdecision to do things that make youhappy and cooking's definitely one ofthem for me I love food I love eating itI love making as well as I feel moreinto the process and once I eat it it'smore fulfilling and that's something Ireally didn't you know hone into a lot Ithink a lot of people don't reallyrealize that as much as it is about thenumbers and articles and all theinformation you have to trust your gutyeah exactlyall right don't test that plate that'smine what is a chunk what is a chunkthat's when you fart and it comes with alittle some extra everybody's had achunk my godno one's undefeatedclick

[Music][Applause]Canada's champs are back[Applause]new seasonyou loveand our guys are sporting new equipmenttheir kicks I want to know how you thinkyour shoes help your performance on thefloor gotta be sturdy a little bit lightfeeling uh the right fitI mean I'm nothing without my shoe sitI'm not the fastest guy in the world soany type of a little advantage I can getyou know best motions they're everythingthe pros want an edge and so do youthat's why we're doing something we'venever done beforetesting some of the most expensivebasketball shoes worn by the NBA'sbiggest stars 11 pairs in total to seehow they stack up against cheaper shoesand ones that fall in the middle let'sbox it up let's do itso we're shipping all these shoes to aSports lab can we really put a price onperformance[Music]we ask raps fans at Jurassic Park is itall about the shoes the shoes are 90% ofthat's a lot and then 10% stalin's 10%sound cap you look good company spend alot of cash trying to convince you thatthey're more expensive shoes are worthit closer to the food everything givesyou more energy to go accelerate withcatchy claims like extra balance oncourt Premium locked down fear and theability to blow right by defendersthanks to a speed plate price definitelymatters to me but yeah price does matterespecially when you're going at his ageright do you think he bought a cheapershoe that it would do the same thing foryou on the court performance wise I wantto buy something that I know is qualitythis time way same deal for the deerfamily let's go when they're not gamingJakari is playing ball with his dad andcoach Dave his mom Linda is their team'smanager how important is the right kindof footwear very important why and whenhe's actually playing obviously we don'twant injury right that'd be the firstconcern I think the shoes more expensivefor a reason right if they put inworking in technologist into the scienceand all that behind it so I think shewas in a cost of like at least $230 it'sit's a pretty good shoe they care a lotabout shoes because they're young ballerhas big basketball dreams what's yourideal dream situation to make it to theNBA yeah any team in particular no knowToronto Raptorslet's meet the weightsthey live for bball dad Greg coaches andthe older boys play so they buy sneakerson the regular I'll double check thatit's sticky and all I'll ask them tocheck the soil you know it in the storeand check the flexibility check you knowthe fit on their foot and they pickshoes carefully for performance safetyand most importantly cost is the mostexpensive shoe always the one to buyit's mostly name prestige colorways so Itry to avoid those you know and try tofind the mid-range yes range right doesthe budget aspect of it I mean they haveto be looking reason becausetop-of-the-line shoes for Greg and hissons would cost more than $600 in oneshot two families one that believeshigh-priced shoes perform better and onethat doesn't let's put it to the testnow remember we buy 11 pairs of shoesprice tags range from $80all the way up to 240 bucks from majorbrands Nike Adidas and Under Armour andour list includes shoes endorsed byLeBron James Russell Westbrook JamesHarden and Steph Curry time to check upon our sneakerswe head to the University of Calgary'shuman performance lab to see how thingsare going hey Tasha nice to meet younice to meet youDarren's definition is the CEO of sportinsight Bill 1ups the project managerhere's what they're testing for okayattraction how the shoe grips to thefloor you need to have enough tractionbetween the shoe and the surface to beable to perform the movements cushioningstiffness how compliant or soft the shoeis under your feet well the morecompliant a shoe is it tends to be morecomfortable energy returned how muchrebound or bounce you get from the shoewe compress the shoe and then we measurehow that known load rebounds or respondsonce we release it there is someresearch some very recent research outthere that shows that the amount ofenergy that's returned from a shoe canhave an influence on performance andforefoot bending stiffness how easy itis to bend the front of the shoe it'sbeen shown that with that appropriatebending stiffness you can actuallyperform better so we can have anindication by doing these mechanicaltests how this particular shoe is goingto function or perform the firstcelebrity-endorsed shoe dates back tothe 1930s semi-pro bowler Chuck Taylorpromoted these kits for $3.25 this isthe ripple sole that's been developed toresearch the last five yearsfast forward to these sneakers in the50s Mike what makes you the best play inthe universe then the Air Jordan in the80s changed the game with slickmarketing and the $100 price tag thesneaker

anythingprofessor ben Oneg has been researchingfootwear for decades explosive storagedoesn't mean anythingsailor gravity doesn't mean anythingwhen you have gravity periods why do youthink companies use those terms then ohthey think they can sell more shoes yeppulling in almost a billion dollars eachyear in North America with diehardsneaker heads waiting for the latest andgreatest shoes to drop so they can planthem and show them off back with thedear family they're about to givepredictions for our test which shoeswill stand out from the restoh sure that look wrong Adidas nextlevel your pick they're all pickingpricey shoes what about the weights it'slike candy for that look at this theirChristmas list is being formed on thispeak I may as well go hurry curse X Pnews P Jesus mom the wades play it safepicking shoes in the middle of the packso which family is on the ballthis is your market thing 11 pairs ofbasketball sneakers and days of testingwill a more expensive shoe performbetterdoes price really make a difference thelab isn't the only test that countsthat's why we're out on the floor withwe're tester JT ankohe's got cred I got himself Spike Lee sobaby hey co-founder of a sneakermagazine and consults with big brandsabout their shoes J is doing areal-world test to see how the shoesfeel under the watchful eyes ofkinesiology professor David Frost andbasketball trainer Shane Danny he's notgetting near as low as he was in thelast one and literally every step youcan hear yeah every step has a soundyeah J's testing for things that aren'tcovered in the lab focusing in on howthe shoes support his feet and anklesI'm curious to know how his foot isfitting inside the shoe it doesn't looklike it's quite fitting to his footproperly he's done his drills but thetest isn't overnow he's doing what many of us can'tafford playing pickup games in 11 pairsof shoes to see which one feels the bestjust got finished playing in the NikeTyree fly trap twos this one has acompression ban on the forefootdocumenting the three weeks with videodiaries hey everyone I just finishedplaying in the adidas next level yeahlaces whatsoeverit's just finished playing in the PG 2.5s if I'm really good on foot all right Jit's been a long haul what are yourpicks Thank You LeBron sixteens theUnder Armor curry 6-day Adidas name fivethe Nike PG 2.5 and the Under Armorlightning five good to knowJ gave top marks to some of the mostexpensive shoes and ones that land inthe middle well Jays personal feelingson support match up with the resultsfrom the labbut first let's check in with Jakarideer who's dominating on the courtin this league he plays with Spencerwait from our other marketplace familyand Greg coaches from the sidelines thekids play scrappy ball and digthemselves out of a hole but in the endour families come up short could adifferent shoe provide an advantage ifit comes out that a 240 dollar shoe is alot better than 160 dollars shoe I'm notgoing to deprive my kids of thatadditional performance time to find outthe lab results are in are you ready tofind out which shoes made themarketplace starting line up with yeahhere we gofirst up the Nike LeBron 16 at 240 bucksso the LeBron did really well incushioning stiffness and it also didwell in energy return Jakari you werethe only one who picked the Bron foroverall performance yeah what do youthink now I think I made a good choicethat there in one of the top five okayis Jakari on to somethingthis is your market place basketball isback and all eyes are on Canada's teamthe Raptors for me is about comfort youwant to feel comfortable to give you alot of support especially for a big guymake sure it is high top and then Ithink that's that's the most importantissues be able to move and stuff likethat's what I really go for it that'swhat the pros look for but what aboutyou and how much are you willing to payshe expensive there's my just rockingthe dis shoes I think that Daviddefinitely doesn't know improve yourgame shoes to ballers can you tell a thecost to be the boss sheepdogs said itbestyou paid a cost to be the boss is heright we send 11 pairs of basketballshoes ranging from $80 to 240 bucks to auniversity lab for testing and now we'rerevealing the results to our basketballfamiliesone of our top five the Nike LeBron 16at 240 bucks they are comfortable whatelse is on the list the $200 Adidasheart in volume 3 Wow oh my god a shoewas near or at the top for starting andstopping traction and it also got topmarks for energy returnnext up the Jordan why not 0.2 at $170sport insight found that it wascomparable to the LeBron 16 one of ourmost expensive shoes also at the top theadidas gain 5 at 165 bucks a goodoverall performer okay guys we're downto the last shoe in our top 5 startinglineup want to hear what that shoe is[Music]the adidas pro spark 2018 at $95 letthat sink in quite surprised thatthey're in the top 5 okay this is a biggap between like the LeBrons and theadidas is crazy I don't even know whatto say because because I if I saw $95I'd immediately look elsewhere and itranked well in traction and energyreturn in cushioning I mean this shoedid solidly I think Davis speech wasright there yeah what blows me awaythough is the fact that it they couldhang with with with the big boys rightthere and yeah for that price I mean mypaid 240 when you could pay 95 and looklike just as much as a star the team atsport insight agrees none of these shoesperformed poorly in any of the test thatwe did there was no correlation betweenprice and any of the mechanicalproperties we investigated so justbecause you're buying the most expensiveshoe doesn't mean it's gonna excel atall these mechanical properties in whatyou value in that particular shoe isgonna be different for different peopleand you might be prepared to pay forcertain things that other people mightnot be prepared to pay for but the priceis not necessarily going to dictate thetotal functional characteristics of aparticular shoe we contact all the bigbrands in our tests to find out why someof their shoes are more expensive thanothers athis an Under Armor don't respond to ourquestions but Nike says it considers avariety of factors when determiningprice including many factoring cost ofmaterials and the selling of itsproducts marketing professor of Kneeshawagrees there may be many factorsinvolved but says there could besomething else at play is some of ithype oh absolutely the price itself isnot just simply the materials but thewhole kind of kit and kaboodle of thewebsite and the display of everythingand the box even let the celebrities whoget paid right we're all paying afraction of LeBrons 500 million it's notlike Nike is is eating that cost youhave to be able to communicate and sellyour product these are brands that areselling shoes ok now that the seriousstuff is over let's play ball thesefamilies now say they'll make differentmoves the next time they sneaker shopmaybe not the cheapest shoe is alwaysthe worstdon't judge the book by the cover lookat it cheaper shoot absolutely the onesthat you aware the most are they're notalways gonna be the better onessometimes you don't have to pay thatmuch to get the same performance if myparents won't really let me get thehighest wine it doesn't mean I'm gettingthe worse shoe because what matters mostis not how much you pay but how you feelwhen you play,25,UCIu639wfFJHsUpt9ljnAlaA,Dallas Bagley,30,10,0,340,"['Nike', 'Air', 'Mag', 'Back', 'to', 'the', 'Future',

hi so how do you tell the differencebetween an authentic 4-port opportunityor a fake one so today I'm going to showyou an authentic Barcelona 2015 2016Jersey that I bought online from areputable place versus a fake one that Ibought in laughs now one of the keydifferences obviously is going to beprice so that looks too good to be trueit probably isfor example this Jersey cost 150 USdollars online and the fake one was wasless than 10 US dollars at a store inLaos the other thing is going to be thefit of it so Mike actually makes twodifferent versions themselves it'salmost like they rip themselves off theymake what they call the the match orperformance or player shoe which isbasically the same Jersey that theplayers wear on the pitch and then theymake one that they call Stadium which isfor the fans it's cheaper it's alsobigger so this the match one is atighter fit for athletic bodies I preferthat being a fairly fit person the Ifind that the size small in theirstadium version is is too big in a bitbaggy whereas this is so small in the inthe match version as you can see it fitsquite snug and tightly you know I'll putthe Y over on to show you the differenceokay so this is the fake the knockoffversion of the of the Barcelona awayJersey obviously the one I was wearingwas their their home jersey and this isa knockoff of the authentic or or asMike calls it the match Jersey and asyou can see it's a lot more baggy that'snot quite as quite a fit it's probablyit probably is still a tighter tighterfit than the Mike official stadiumversion cuz I mean they're even biggerstill but I'm going to show you a fewmore detail differences as well okay sothe main differences between thesequality andpurely used and if you had a littletricks that I'll show you as welland it's also going to pen on the thequality of the paper this is a prettygood quality fake but it's actually Isuppose more similar to like stone ripoff the stadium version then the actualauthentic version on the 2015 version ofthe night soccer or football jerseysthey have these ventilation holes in theback seal is now on the real stadium orhome sorry the real match version youcan see that these five holes at theback of all got a lining to reinforceand strengthen them and the same withthe holes on the sleeve the other thingyou'll notice is that there's differentmaterial so if you hold hold this up tothe light you can see see through thismaterial here on the inside it's a bitof quite hollow weave for aeration andit's actually going to a differentmaterial at the top here at the back ofthe neck so it still has the holes butas you can see there's no noreinforcement around those holes on theinside there's the holes and also thethe fabric is pretty much the samefabric at the top here as it is downhere it's not you can't see through itas easily how does a lot of aerated onthe authentic match version you can seethey've got an extra layer of it's likea film here that goes over the seam soit's like a heat press seam it's notstitched this is on the inside of thecollar where is on on the knockoff youknow you've just got stitching thereas you can see the difference betweenthe the yellow knockoff here and theauthentic mic one here also if you lookat the stitching on the band down theside so the originals or the authenticmic one has got it doubled overstitching it's quite neat and tidywhereas the fete completely differentit's a much cheaper type of teaching nowthe other thing is the type of materialits use down this side on the fakeversion it's the same material all theway down all the way to the sleevewhereas on the the real like oneit starts with similar sort of materialbut then the holes get bigger as youmake your way to the sleeve then they'requite large holes there and again hereyou can see that material on the sleevesis slightly different to the material onthe shirt itself another thing is thestitching just around the whole outsideso this is the the bottom of the Jerseyso you can see it's got two two rows ofstitching their particular style but thefabric is just being cut and thestitching put across whereas on theauthentic one the to do it's only onerow of stitching but the fabrics beingfolded under and stitched along so itleaves a lot smoother and it's not gonnafray and that's along the bottom andalso the same thing around the sleevesit's being folded under there's on thesleeves of the fake again it's justbeing cut off so you can see that littleflap there another good point is thetags so on this tag you'll see this isthe authentic one the numbers on herethe style the color number andnow if you look at the tag on the insideof the jersey so it's got that same samenumber they're the six five eight sevennine zero and the four two two and it'sgot the s up there for small inside someof the ones I've seen do it's just gotthese larger tags yes another feature isthese authentic tags that night puts onhere so on the match versions then likeauthentic tags are gold on the stadiumversions they're actually silver now oneof the key differences you can see hereis that the fake ones actually stitchedon whereas the authentic ones actuallyheat pressed on the numbers are similarthis is sort of like a realistic numberso it looks like it could be real if thenumbers are too low then it could be afake as well the other thing I noticedwas that when I was in the store Ipicked up this Jersey I compared thisnumber on here against some otherjerseys that they had there there was aParis Milan Jersey and actually had theexact same number so that you know theforgers are going to make one of thesetags with the exact same number butprint heaps of them and put them on allthe tracks so if you if you're gettingonline you can't necessarily look at allwe have the jerseys there but if they'vegot photographs of the tags then youmight get a tell if they're all the samenumber across different clubs then thatobviously means they're fake now thematerial that's used in this fake is isprobably similar in feel to thematerials used in Mike's stadium versionso don't get confused between this andthe and the official mack stadiumversion because the night stadiumversion is the same material down theinside here as well rather than havingthe changes on on the match version okayso if we go to the logo itself noticethey both look very similar in this casethe I think the yellow here on the onthe fake is a bit off it's a bitbrighter than it is on the authenticMike one other thing is that it's it'squite soft and thin it's really easy tofold hasn't got a lot of stiffness to itwhereas the authentic ones got quite abit of stiffness and bulk to it otherthing is the the printing on the shirtso this is the Qatar Airways logono it's it's quite thin as well and itdoesn't have any little plastic coatingover it it's quite easy to fold whereasthe on the authentic one if you lookclosely it's got a little clear plasticcoating around the edge and it's quitestiff so that it's not folding as easilyit's quite thick and that's the same onthe sleeves so the logo on the sleevethe same sort of thing look at thatclosely you can see the the clear bitover the top is a quite smooth and yeahthe UNICEF logo on the backso it's the stiffer feel I'm comparisonto the the fake it's quite soft okay soanother thing to note is the quality ofour stitching inside the neck so insideyeah you can see that inside the neck atthe front this is the authentic versiondoes it's got the stitching around thetop here but the folded Euler piece offabric is actually glued or heat bondedtogether there you can see a little bitof some sort of plastic in material overthe edge there whereas on the fake youknow it's different stitching up herebut this is just folded over it's reallynot a poor quality in comparisonstitching the fake you know thestitching there is quite thick and solidbut there's not much of a gap betweenthe letters whereas the the authenticit's actually a finer stitched in thereit's thicker and it's got a bit of aspace between it so it's see the twoside-by-side you can see that theauthentic blue one there it's a bit of athinner stitching as far as the boldnessof the the letters themselves and a bitmore of a gap between the letters okayso another thing on the authentic one onthe sleeve here sorryfrom so then on the inside snow putthere well so you've got the dots acrosson the sleeve and on this one youactually got a hole this one thatactually got a whole panel stitched onhere whereas with the authentic one it'sthe same piece of fabric let's just gotthe darts in there on the peg on thesleeve it's a separate panel just inthere so yeah those are the maindifferences don't get confused betweenthe knife match and the knife stadiumbut this is a official knife matchplayer issue and this is a knockoff Mikematch issue so those are the sorts ofthings to look for when you're trying tospot a fake like soccer or footballjersey so I hope this video has beenhelpful to you thanks for watching,22,UCfG5R0_7WnC2Fj_JkFxsf6Q,Rhea Bue,35,Not available,0,Not available,"['Rhea Bue', 'Rhea', 'Bue',

i was the fastest girl in americathere are women here almost twice herage being left in her wayi set many national records and i was astraight a student[Applause]when i was 16 i got a call from albertosalazar at nikehe was the world's most famous trackcoach and he told me i was the mosttalented athlete he'd ever seenduring my freshman year in college imoved out to train with himand his team full time at nike worldheadquartersit was a team of the fastest athletes inthe world and it was a dream come truei joined nike because i wanted to be thebest female athleteeverinstead i was emotionally and physicallyabused by a system designed by albertoand endorsed by nike[Music]this is what happened to mewhen i first arrived an all-male nikestaffbecame convinced that in order for me toget betteri had to become thinner and thinner andthinnerthis nike team was the top runningprogramin the country and yet we had nocertified sports psychologistthere was no certified nutritionistit was really just a bunch of people whowerealberto's friends so when i went toanybody for helpthey would always just tell me the samething and that was to listen albertoalberta was constantly trying to get meto lose weighthe created an arbitrary number of 114pounds and he wouldusually weigh me in front of myteammatesand publicly shame me if i wasn'thitting weighthe wanted to give me birth control pillsand diuretics to lose weightthe latter of which isn't allowed intrack and fieldi ran terrible during this time itreached a point where i was on thestarting line and i'd lost the racebefore istarted because in my head all i wasthinking of wasnot the time i was trying to hit but thenumber on the scale i saw earlier thatdayit would be naive to not acknowledge thefact that weight is important in sportsit's like boxers need to maintain acertain weight or you know everybodyalways ends up citing the math about howthe thinner you arethe faster you're gonna run because youhave to carry less weight but here's abiology lesson i learned the hard waywhen young women are forced to pushthemselves beyond what they'recapable at their given age they're atrisk for developingreds suddenly you realize you've lostyour period for a couple months and thena couple months becomes a couple yearsandin my case it was a total of three andif you're not getting your periodyou're not going to be able to have thenecessary levels of estrogento maintain strong bone health and in mycasei broke five different bonesthe new york times magazine published astoryabout how alberto was training me andnurturing my talentwe weren't doing any of that i felt soscared i felt so alone and i felt sotrappedand i started to havesuicidal thoughts i started to cutmyselfsome people saw me cutting myself anduh sorry umnobody really did anything or saidanythingumso in 2015 i ran this race and i didn'trunsuper well and afterwards there was athunderstorm going onhalf the track was under one tentum alberta yelled at me in front ofeverybody else at the meetand he told me that i clearly gainedfive pounds before the raceum it was also that night that i toldalbertoand our sports like that i was cuttingmyself and they pretty much told me theyjust wanted to go to bedand i think for me that was my kick inthe head where i was like this system issicki think even for my parents in certainways once ifinally vocalized to them i mean theywerehorrified they bought me the first planeride homeand they were like get on that flightget the hell out of therei wasn't even trying to make theolympics anymore i was just trying tosurviveso i made the painful choice and i quitthe teamafter a multi-year investigation the u.santi-doping agency has banned albertosalazar from the sport for four yearsnike will shut down theoregon project nike ceo mark parkerstepping down from the company injanuaryof 2020. those reforms are mostlya direct result of the doping scandalthey're not acknowledging the fact thatthere's a systemic crisisin women's sports and at nike in whichyoung girls bodiesare being ruined by an emotionally andphysicallyabusive system that's what needs tochangeand here's how we can do itfirst nike needs to change in track andfieldnike is all-powerful they control thetop coachesathletes races even the governing bodyyou can't just fire a coach andeliminate a programand pretend the problem is solved myworryis that nike's merely going to re-brandthe old programand put alberto's old assistant coachesin chargesecondly we need more women in powerpart of me wondersif i had worked with more femalepsychologists nutritionistsand even coaches where i'd be todayi got caught in a system designed byand for men which destroys the bodies ofyoung girlsrather than force young girls to fendfor themselveswe have to protect themi genuinely do have hope for the sportand i plan to be running for many yearsto comeand so part of the reason i'm doing thisnow is i want to end this

hey guys this BVH nightmare and today Ihave a long-awaited review of a bootthat I've been waiting to review for along over a year and it is the Nike sfbspecial field boot alright getting onright into the boot alright not leavingany questions to worry about I am hereis the booth this is the Nike sfb thespecial feel food I've bought in theseboots before I have a pair of sittingoff to my left and I'm going to comparethese later this is a branch make a newpair bought literally an hour ago thatthe pair I have off to my left is abouta pair that's about a year old we'vebeen put through it's gone through helland back through Iraq and stuff likethat so let's break into the boots and alittle handy dandy nifty special fieldboot card / manual that they give youokay so just go over there a littlelittle manual that they give you thefirst time I bought this I didn't getone of these or if I did I threw it outright away because I didn't givebut on it goes over pretty much over alot of stuff they got uh how did youlock lacing so boots stay really reallysecure and give you all the little specsand stuff like that and when you open itup gives you a nice little diagram orpop-up boots how the boots constructedand everything really cool nice littleadd-on there for Nike but uh we don'treally care about that we want to seewhat the boots look like okay sostarting from the top of boot andworking our way down we basically have aten major areas that I want to cover allright our first area is the polyesterwoven shell alright it's a very veryquick dryingit's a brace of resistant and it's veryvery lightweight basically what thatmeans is you know you jump in a creep ator like whathappen Iraq as we roll over into a canaland about five minutes after jump aroundthe canal three o'clock the morning inIraq these boots were dry and my fevercompletely dry with the pair of socks Ihad on bracelet resistant the old pairof boots that have these there's minimalminimal very minimal wear along thispolyester shot right here andlightweight is what makes a pair of sizenine boots fifteen point nine ouncesit makes part of this bootie that muchlighter second area is the synthetic lipleather whoo I can't speak leatheroverlays what if it basically means isit's this part right here right here byyour heel what it means is there'sthere's no break-in period to the bootand basically it's very flexibleall right this amount of flexible missis the same amount I have in my old pairright here all right these boots feelthe exact same as the boots I have thatI wore for a year all right it that'show good these boots are all right againquick quick drying lightweight anddurable you can't beat that the thirdarea is on the sole of the boot allright if you actually look in here thereis a very very nice liner I've had noproblems with the sock liner I and itmoves with your foot and it adds supportand cushioning I've had no problems withthe cushioning of this boot and the sockliner that comes with this boot I'venever had to replace it all right numberfour would be the ventilation holes overherethese also work as a water drainage sowhen you boot does get wet you can drainyour water out of here and get yourboots dry again they keep the boots veryvery cool these boots also work well incold I just got back from a trainingarea in Texas it doesn't get cold notvery but it does get cold for people wholive in Texas and these woods worksuperbly in the cold weather also thesedrink water really well and they keepyour dog cool really well the number 5layer is the general wood leatherfootbed withKalmar Lila what this does is it's verycomfortable but it keeps your foot safeit's part of a camel or lighter and soif you like step on a nail or simplysomething sharp it's not going throughall the way through the Sawyer boot upinto your foot makes your foot very verysafe within the protection of your bootall right the the six area and is thethermoplastic forefoot shielding allright that's that's a tongue twisterright there what it is is only it's onlyin the bump from about here off of theboot and what it is it's a punctureresistant dog basically shield that's inthe food kind of like the Kevlar linerthat spans the whole boot that spans awhole group what it is is it punctureresistant I've had personal experiencestepping on nails with my old bootsstuff like that that it works you're youstep on it and you feel this this stuffand basically you're looking like ohshould I step on a nail and it doesn'tgo through and it really really worksthe seventh area is the anatomiccushioned natural motion based midsoleall right I'm not reading off a scripthere all right so I can't say that frommemory what it does is a ensure smoothsupportive heel to toe transitionalright so when you step in here and youbend that that heel section moves inthis heel section moves independentlyfrom your midsection right here and thenit transfers over into your the ball ofyour foot and it leaves for a very nicefoot motion that basically is very verycomfy and a great flexibility all rightarea is eight nine and ten have to dealwith the the sole of the boot now we'regetting into the sole all right numbereight is the directional traction outersole it has reversed edges which had araised heel which gives you bettertraction uphill and also downhillnumber nine is the articulated mid footwhat it is is this area right in herethis mid foot area is separate from theheel and the ball of your foot whichgives you better comfort andrange of motion with the boot and it'sdeeply spliced with flex grooves if youcan't see it right in here what it doesis not a range of motion all right thesefoods are all about range of motionnumber ten is the sticky rubber forfront lugs is what they call them andbasically essentially what traction onall terrain I've had no problems withtraction of these boots all rightespecially when they're new becausethese boots are rugged as hell okay sonow we're going to break into parasection of the review of where we'recomparing and contrasting the the newpair versus the old pair all right asyou can see moving in my right hand andold being in my left hand all right thecolor difference is I in my right handyou can see there's a slight colordifference between the leather suede andthe nylon fabric I in the older pairthat that color change has diminishedbasically all right the biggestdifference you can see these are both ofour right foot boots also is your treadpattern all right you're being on theright along being on the left look atthe difference in tread right the toealrightnot very worn out of all the foot warmthe out the middle mid sectiondestroyed the heel pretty much flat allright now defending these boots allright these boots have been put througha helmet back alright I beat the living out of these boots all right thereason that this sole right now is B tolive it is because this is a hardrubber right here and this is more likea kind of a soft cushion once a foam butit's very soft and therefore itdeteriorates a lot faster and this partright back here the rippled sole is thesame material up here so it wears aboutthe sameat the same rate okay comparing the theboots again right one on the left thisone new one on the right over on theleft alright you can see the ventilationholes and water drainage holes they'restill there no problems with them notgoing to and complain um thebiggest difference you can see on thiscomparing the trash is the layer thatthis boot has received on its abrasiveside now right here there's actually astory behind this we actually had a fireand I got diesel fuel on this part ofthe boot and my boot started on fireso I can say this will not happen99% of the time all right if you want topour diesel fuel on these and let themon fire that's more than likely happenbut this is only because I decent fuelspill in my boot and it started meltingthrough my bootalright say again laces I have 550 cordin it right now because my laces startedgoing to alright that's becausediesel fuel where they would just turnstarted turning to crap the tongue ofthe boot I don't know if you can see itas you can see right here where yourfoot and your ankles start to cometogether I'm starting I am I'm actuallyjust starting to get hold in the tonguewhere the foot and ankle start areactually meet right in this area wherethere's a lot of bending motion not abig deal very very minimal not a bigconcern all right where the bootconnects to the sole all rightthe biggest concern I have is where theheel right here started to separate fromthe boot itself this is the only problemI've had is the heel started to separateall I did was put some epoxy in thereit fix the problem I've never had anyother problems with it only other slightproblem is on the outside living yourfoot I have some small separation herebut this is very very minimal and itdoesn't concern me one bit all rightone thing I do want to point out to youguys is the Natha shrinkage but the formthe formality of the boot how it formsto your foot really really well both ofthese are a size 10 boot alright theseboots are both lined up as best as mycrooked eyes can see and you can seethat the size 10 slightly the new size10 is slightly bigger than the old size10 reason being for this as I've wornthese boots and as I wash these bootsthey've shrunk a little bit to the sizeof my foot that's been around my footnow these boots have been in water andif shrunk to my foot when they've driedand stuff like that and you know what Ihave no problem with that because thoseboots are perfectly form-fitting boot atthat point other than thatthese boots are freakin awesome for methe positives and negatives for theseboots positives all right they fit greatright out of the box you can wear threeseconds after you buy these boots onethey're from Nike so you know that'smade by a great company they mean welland you know that they can put out goodproducts cons pricing $140 that's notthat bad alright I'm willing to spendtwo hundred two hundred fifty dollars onmy feet of needy for a good pair ofboots second con is the tread of thesole all right it wears kind of quickfor my liking I have a pair of rocky c-4trainers that are actually sitting righthere that I have had for a year and thesoles are still really really anisoleand then and the traction on them isstill really really good I'd like to seea little bit better made so on these butthat's just one guy that really can'tmy those are the only two cars leftfor the foots a little a little bit onthe pricing and the sole other than thatthese boots are superb my rating forthese boots is at nine and a half out often for the simple fact that is one Ilove them and

hi Jacoba unisport webtv and on today's menu wehave our review of the Nike magistaOprah now the magista has build up quitesome busts so today we're going to takea look at if this boot can actuallyrevolutionize the way we think aboutfootball boots so if you want to knowhow the magista Oprah performs on thepitch then you better stay right herewith me so let's look at the fit side ofthe boot because herenow you wanted to eliminate all thedistractions on the magista and sointroduced the Flyknit upper and thedynamic fit collar now because of thisnew construction some of you might beworried that the magista is tough to puton but luckily it's not as hard as itseems because basically you just gottaloosen the laces up a bit and then pullthe boot on like a regular socket andokay you got to pull a bit harder butyou get the deal and once you get theboot on you really feel that the fit issomething else now because of this reeflining material and the dynamic fitcolor you get a pretty close tight areally personal fit in the magista andit's basically like it's made to followthe shape of your foot and also nikehave applied a black inner lining whichis slightly padded so you get a verycomfortable feeling wrapping around yourfoot while also making the magista feela little bit more solid that you wouldactually think I need to boot X now theawesome thing about flying it is that itallows Nike to actually remove thetongue on the Medusa which makes theboot really hawk your foot uber tightall over basically wrapping it like asock wood and further enhancing thisfeeling are the Brio cables that go fromthe soleplate into the eye state andwhen you're pulling the laces tight youcan really feel that the beat iswrapping your foot like a sock andproviding lockdown and the cool thingwith the fact that there is laseron the magista they didn't need to bebecause the upper would still fit youwell but because of the laces you canreally pull the boot tight and adjustyourself how tight you want it to be noweven though the Brio cables work reallywell in keeping your foot on the plate Iwas looking for just a tiny bit morelockdownin the magista simply because my foottended to move just a little bit whenchanging directions with a lot of forceand I mean it's no big deal but it'sjust something I know it size wise I'dsay the magista is true to size I wasn'twith my usual size 40 and the fit ispretty much perfect both length andwidth wise but the coolest thing aboutthe magista is that the gr13 lasts thebooties bill on will accommodate both aslim and a wide foot especially becausethe fly net material will stretch to fitthe white footed playersnow the thing that really sets themagista apart from any other boot I'veever tried is the dynamic fit color andbasically it makes the magista feel morelike a part of your foot than any otherfootball boot out there but to be honestI don't think that physically it makesyour lower leg and your foot move morein unison than in say any other footpoking the thing is it feels like thatand you get that sensation mainlybecause of the closed seamless fit likethere basically are no distractionsbetween these parts of your leg and yourfoot because the magista is made to helpyou move in tight spacesit's equipped with a pee bags an islandsoleplate with mostly conical studs andalso a few bladed studs now you canactually feel that the nylon frame ispretty stiff and responsive making themagista feel like it's reacting verywell to your little bursts of speed andcombining that with the fact that nikeremoves the insole board you're reallyclose to the ground and can transferenergy from your foot to the soleplateand then ultimately the ground themagista also made me feel a bit morefree in my movements and after thinkingabout it I came to the conclusion thatit's because 19the soleplate without the mechanicalflex which basically means that my footis not forced to bend in the same areain the same way every time and when youcombine this with the stiffness and thestability from the nylon frame youactually get a very nice combinationwhere you feel you can basically burstinto any direction you want at any timegrip wise the magista just what it'ssupposed to which is help you turn ontight spaces mainly thanks to theconical studs that really give you aseamless motion through the ground whenyou're turning on the spot and I reallylike it in that aspect now as we knowmagista is made for the creativemidfielder and as a midfielder you needas much control on the ball as you canpossibly get and to do this Nike haveequip the Flyknit upper with these realcables that create this honeycomb blackpattern and that is one to give you morestability but also two to give you morefriction on the ball and we know thatmore friction needs more grip and moregrip means a bit more control but thequestion is how does it workand yeah it actually works pretty welland the touching the magista is quite aninteresting combination mostly becauseon one hand you get a pretty close tothe ball feel thanks to the thin Flyknitupper rim but then again on the otherhand it's also a bit soft and slightlypadded mostly thanks to this slightlycushioned inner lining so it's a bit ofa mix that's very very interesting nowit's not a total barefoot like feel buthaving said that you're still a lotcloser to the ball in the magista thanin other boots with similar amounts ofgripwhen it comes to shooting the magista ispretty no-nonsense there are no issuesgetting under the ball and because youhave no tongue you really get a niceclean striking surface all over theOpera but one of the best things whenstriking the ball to me is the innerlining because again it takes away a bitof this thing when you really strike theball hard and it makes it a ripepleasure because the padding is just theright combination or you can still feela lot but it doesn't hurt that muchwhen you really put your foot throughthe ball when it comes to the Briocables they're also going to give you abit of friction when you're striking theball whether you're striking it with theinside of your foot for the instep anddon't get me wrong it's not going toturn you into this world master butthere's still a nice little toolso the final verdict on the magistaobrah is that it's well it's reallyreally awesome and the fit is one of thebest I have ever tried in a footballboom similar because it fits your footso closely that is actually hard todescribe you have to try it and to putit into perspective when I went back toa conventional football team I reallymissed the closest ation off the planetand the dynamic bit color it's that goodwell what do you think about the magistaOprah and is it something for you wellleave your thoughts in the commentsection below and if you have questionswell that's the way to go swell becausethis was all I have to do for today I'llsee you later on and use the wet TVsigning off to yell so is it hard toclean the magista well for the part thathas Nike skin with a CC on it water anddirt will come right off when you wipeit with a cloth but the dynamic colorand the tongue pod is exposed the finiteis exposed so it tends to get a bit moredirty and you have to put a bit moreeffort into cleaning it off with a softbrush and the dirt is going to stay abit there so you can see it on the colorbut that's kind of the way it is I guess,17,UCs6wjiRgvnKlICGA2sDlE2A,Aaron Thompson,52,4,0,194,"['Track', 'Nike', 'Commercial', 'Bernard', 'Lagat']",Nike Commercial With Bernard Lagat,EcChqf5-KpM,127114

lines of sneakersthat we've ever covered in our videosthe first vapormax dropped only threeyears ago in march of 2017 for 190despite the shocking aesthetic of itssoul the first version was actuallypretty minimalone of the main goals of the vapormaxdesign was to do away withunnecessary aspects of the shoe cuttingdown on the weightand bringing the wear closer to the airtechnology the processof designing and testing the vapormaxsole was painstakinglegend has it that it took 15 tries toget the soul right and that the shoe hadto be tested on 350 different runnersnike also claims that the mold for thesole is composed of over 39000 different components the exhaustivetesting and reworking of the vapormaxsoleresulted in its designers completelyeliminating the need for a couple

despite the initialpushback on the idea of the visible airunit and air max 1the shoe was a monumental success andthough we might be able to drawparallels between the air max 1 and thevapormaxnot every sneaker that includes boldrisky new technologyis successful in its leap of faith ifyou watched our video on the history ofnike shocksyou know that shocks was one of thosenike releases that took that leap offaithand ended up failing short of nike'sother endeavorsthe hype was relatively short-lived andshocks just never found the acceptanceand long-term mainstream success thatthe jordan or air max lines enjoyed andgrew fromis vapormax doomed to a similar fate asnike shocksseems to me that if vapormax cushioningtech doesn't end up being the future ofrunning shoe designvapormax is likely going to have tosurvive off the strength of itsaesthetic appeal alonewhich honestly at this point i could seeworking out vapormax has already seenso many hybrids and collabs in the merethree years since its

andthe country was sitting on the couchwatching the bill clinton and monicalewinsky scandal unfoldnike on the other hand was focused onkeeping its customers excitedthey had just released the air max 97with a nearly full360 visible air bubble and expectationswere high for what they would do nextthis is where footwear designer sergiolozano came into playsergio lozano is a designer responsiblefor one of nike's greatest shoes of alltimeactually my favorite nike shoe ever theair max 95the air max 95 was groundbreakingbecause it featured an air unit in theforefoot of the chute and was inspiredby human anatomynow in 1998 three years after the launchof the air max 95lozano wanted to play on the 95shortcomings and design a new shootbut drastic changes had already beenmade on the air max line since lozanolast workedon it the air max 96 which also featuredairin both the heel and the forefoot of theshoe was a huge departure from his workon the air max 95and the air max 97's futuristic silverbullet aestheticalong with its debut of a fully visibleair unit made it tough for lozano tofollow upby the way i know a lot of you guys haveprobably never seen the air max 96beforeit's a pretty crazy looking shoe rightthe air max 98featured a synthetic leather and meshupper that was quite bulkyfor an air max shoe sergio lozano addedvertically ripped side walls which weresimilar to the 95 but these rib sidewalls were a little thinner thesilhouette used the same exact fulllength air unit from the air max 97and the air max 98 complex lacing systemwas informed by lozano's time working onnike'sacg program all conditions gear if youdidn't know what that stands for the airmax 98 released in early 1998in several launch colorways but the onethat we refer to as the og colorwaythese daysis the red white and varsity blue pairalso known as the air max 98 gundamlegend has it the colorway was inspiredby the widely popular japanese anime ofthe 70s and 80s calledgundam a military science fiction animethat features giant robot suitsone of which was named the rx-782 whichlozano tookinspiration from but there's no officialcollaboration between gundam and nikeas the year went on nike would releaseseveral colorways of the 98including kids versions which featuredthe air max 95 soul instead of the airmax 97 soulunfortunately the price point was one ofthe many factors that contributed to theair max 98's failureretailing at 150 dollars making it themost expensive shoe in nike's catalogat the time for context 150 is about 225dollars todayanother factor that played into itsdownfall was the fact that the airmax 98 had to compete with the newlyreleased and incredibly successful airmax plus which came out the same yearthe air max plus also known as the airmax plus tnofficially debuted tuned air nike'spremium cushioning technology at thetimethe air max 98 featured tuned air aswell but it wasn't necessarily a sellingpoint for its releasearound the same time nike also releaseda variation of the shoe that's worthnotingthe air max 98 tl which featured amodified air unit with additionalsegmentationand a redesigned upper it was justanother silhouette that drew attentionaway from the air max 98 that sergiolozano originally designedbefore the year could even end the airmax 98was already appearing on sale racks andretailers across the countrybut even at the reduced price peoplestill weren't buying the 98and it was quickly forgotten asconsumers moved on to the next thingor in some cases they just opted forbuying new colorways of the air max 95and air max 97 and who could blame themit wouldn't be until march 201416 years after its debut that we wouldsee the first ever retroof the air max 98 the first retrorelease was the white total orange andmetallic pairbut throughout the rest of 2014 nikeretroed other colorways of the 98and in 2016 with supreme hype at anall-time highnike and supreme partnered up to do apack of four air max 98sinspired by

"[Music]fell pretty good welcome home great tobe home but I couldn't help but bereally pleased to see the Dean wearing abusiness suit and Nike shoes you knowbut I think we can all be and we can allbe glad that basically I was not thefounder of jockey underwear well we'lltry and make that a permanent change inthe Elevens wardrobe now I felt we knowyou don't do too many public speakingevents and a question a lot of peoplehave asked is what does it take to getPhil Knight up on stage so I thoughtmaybe we should share the story of whatgot you here todaynow you probably remember that we firstcrossed paths a couple of months agojust over theremake a McDonald Hall you were enteringthe building when I very politelyinterrupted you introduce myself weexchanged a couple of pleasantries andthen you went on inside about your daynow what you're probably less aware ofPhil is that I decided to camp outsideMcDonald Hall for the next 40 minuteswatching every possible human exit tothe building so that I could find youand you know casually bump into you asecond time to pitch you this interviewit's creepy I know yeah that that's howit happened I'll be honest I was prettynervous when you did come at that secondtime it was fight or flight I verynearly walked the other way but therewas this voice in my head it just keptsaying we'll just do itbut really Phil we are so thrilled andexcited to have you back on campus and Ithink I speak for every student herewhen I say how grateful we are for thisincredible business school well thankyou but you know having stalked me forat least 40 minutes I feel that thereshould be some payback oh I know thatmost of you know that Will's mother magshas come all the way from Ireland to behere today and having come such a longway I think you should reveal somethingabout yourself that she doesn't know soI don't know what you're trying tosuggest I was a perfect child well didyou make your bed this morning I didn'teven sleep in my own bed this morningcuz I gave it to my mom that wasn't whatit sounded likeall right now Phil Phil we don't want tomake you feel old huh this is payback bythe way yeah this could go back andforth a long time that's rightbut it's been almost 60 years yep sinceyou were here in our shoes an incomingMBA class of 1962 what kind of personwas Phil Knight back at the GSB howwould you have described yourself yeah Iwill but I wanted to tell you firstabout coming back to campus after beinggone for a whilethat you go out 20 years or so and youhaven't been back for a while and youcome back and it's more about justsharing a moment with family and friendsit's for a moment you step back inhistory and remember when you had allthe worldwide laying out before you andyou decided the things that you weregoing to find important and it wasreally the start of you becoming what heultimately became when I come back forjust a moment I always hear the voice ofFrank Shallenberger Bob Davis Jimporterfieldand I know that sounds sort of corny toeducated group but I promise you thatover halfthe people in this room when they comeback here 20 years from now will havethose same feelings you know for me youknow it was well yeah that I was the guythat thought an extrovert was the personthat stared at other people's shoes thatthe the it was a time for me to kind ofgrow and and chase what I was reallygoing to become and so it was really abig transitional period for me in mylife and as I say to this day when Icome back I still get inspired andlifted up do you've any favoritememories from your days back at Stanfordoh that no it was just a turning pointin general for me that you know my if Iwas honest I'd say that my undergraduatecareer was really focused on track andit got to be when I got to be a graduatestudent that has really focused on whatit was I wanted to be and this was justthe right school at the right time withthe right inspirational professors andit really doesn't get any better thanthatmm-hmm so you do graduate the GSB in1962 yep it's the time when SiliconValley isn't even a phrase yet right andyou had what you call this crazy ideawhat was the crazy idea and where did itcome about well I took theentrepreneurship class from FrankShallenberger and basically the projecthe had a term project where youbasically either attached yourself to acompany in the area or for the purposeof the paper made up a company and andhow it would succeed and even in thosedays a lot of my classmates were writingabout electronics which was certainlybeyond me since when I turn on a lightbulb when I turn on the electric switchthe light bulb comes on it's magic forme but my old track coach was alwaysworking with shoes and that felt thatyou know a light lightweight and shoeswas something that was neglected by themajor manufacturers Adidas and Puma andindeed my senior year Otis Davis won thePacific Coast Conference championshipand a pair of homemade Bowerman shoeswhich were ounce elated lighter than theother shoes so I kind of put thosethings togetherand and said if you were starting a shoefactory would you stillin Germany and I said it's such alabor-intensive business it makes moresense to start it in Japan Japan beingthe country that took German camerasdidn't and dominated the camera marketsays could they do the same thing insports use now it's really the thesis ofthe paper which ultimately I got caughtup in and here we are now you got an Ain that paper right I did okay but thatmattered if he ridiculed the paper Idon't know where we do today well thiswas a time when entrepreneurship postGSB was not just a last travel path itwas probably a less celebrated path whatgave you the confidence to push aheadwell if I didn't know I was gonna haveto be an accountant and now that'sthat's a scary thought no it was no butit was a it was when I wrote the paperit it just stayed in my head and at thetime I think the the ratio was the 26out of 12 27 new companies failed so Iknew the odds weren't high but I reallybegan to feel if I could do this thatwould really be meaningful to me andsomething that I would really have a lotof passion for and about and so that'swhere it started and away we wentnow two years in many of your classmateshave gone dan more traditional careerpaths you're back in Oregon you'reliving in your old room in the familyhouse and you're selling shoes out ofthe trunk of your car did you ever havedates in those moments and what was itthat kept you going well obviously therewere a lot of doubts but that I enjoyedwhat I was doing and I really thoughtthat I was bringing a product to theworld that was better than the otherproduct and and so I believed and and ifyou read the book wasn't too long beforeI had a bunch of other people thatbelieved as well and we just through allthe ups and downs and there were plentyof downs that we never stopped believingandso a lot of people say why did you staywith it there were a lot of negativemoments and a lot of downturns and and Ilook back on those days the most fun Iever had in business it was it was thatevery day every Monday you went to workand you knew it mattered what you didincluding whether you're gonna meetpayroll on Friday but it was an excitingtime and that that Frank Shallenbergerhad done a wonderful job of preparing usfor you know being an entrepreneur BobDavis a marketing professor said ifyou're gonna be an entrepreneur he saidevery day is a crisis in every Fridaysat Jesus crisis it was kind of the wayit wasnow you also talk in your book Sherdogabout those early trips to Asia mm-hmmso you're 24 years old traveling aloneto Japan it's a culture you don't know alanguage you don't speak to try andbroker that first shoe import deal sothis was a time before Stanford's globalstudy trip Sergey mixes where did thatability to embrace hustle anduncertainty come from in you well by thetime I got there I believed and so thatI believed that it was a good idea Ibelieve that if we can I get acooperative Japanese factory that Icould make the idea of work and so yeahthat overcame you know when you'rebidding I'm an entrepreneurand introvert why you basically have toyou have to believe you have to overcomethe shyness to to take certain chancesand I was willing to do that and youknow there were a lot of ups and downsbut ultimate worked and you know I thinkat the end of the day you got to believeand and that's what I did have maybeabove everything else mm-hmm no as yousaid the team grew and you weren't alonein this endeavor and I think there's nostory of Nike with that of coursementioning Bill Bowerman your formertrack coach at Oregon later US Olympicstrack coach and of course yourco-founder what became Nike you'vedescribed yourself as a person who'salways needed heroeswhy was bill a hero to you and what isit you learn from him well he was a veryunique person that that he was probablythe best track and field coach in worldfor one thing but he was also at acertain command presence and a certainbelief in certain leadership things thatthe leaders did you know he he said I'mnot a I'm not a track coach he says I'ma professor of competitive response andhe he had a way of having sayings thatgot your attention and really focusedyou on attitude his strategy for runningthe mile was start out and run the firsttwo laps at a very fast pace run thethird lap as fast as you canon the fourth lap triple your speed andand they said that you know the OregonTrail he says the the Cour the thecowards never started in the week diedalong the way that leaves you and me andthat's once again him getting it kind ofkind of your attitude and is his bestone for me it was always do right andfear no man and so he had a biginfluence on my life certainly thebiggest influence other than my parentsand if you go back through this sayingsand who he was he was always working onattitude this is a man that had seencombat in World War twoyou know fired a gun and been fired atand he had seen competition that it'sits most extreme level and he thought hecould his job as a confessor professorof competitive response was to get kidsready for young men and young womenultimately to be ready for the thetoughest competition they can face soyou know he brought to me you know acertain attitude which you can be anintrovert and have attitude and so thatwas sort of me and he had a hugeinfluence on that and and he was a heroof mine in those days and to this daymm-hmm when you first met him youdescribed it as love and fear at firstsight right and then there was a littlehate that came after that he really kindof believed in hazythat and you had to prove that youwanted to be there and so he would makeyou go through hoops which I didsomewhat reluctantly now beyond bill ofcourse you talk with a lot of affectionabout that core early Nike team and Ithink you had a name for each otherright well yeah we did oh I see you'replaying that game now that the firstfour or five people in the company wewound up calling each other but faceswhich we don't do that anymore were moreprofessional group now you know our viewfrom the top team we've a similar namefor each other actually it's good it'shealthy but what was it about that earlyteam and that culture that made it sosuccessful well I think first of allthey were a bizarre group to say theleast each of them in his own way butthey were and I hope this showed in abook that they were able very ablepeople that really kind of didn't getalong with society in general so it waskind of a perfect fit and theycomplemented each other in terms oftheir abilities and then lastly all ofthem believed it was they they just whenwe would hit a down period nobodythought this is in okay okay we got toget together and find their way out ofthis one and so it was fun being afoxhole with those guys and andbasically it's corny but we loved eachother and we were going to go throughthis come hell or high water and it wasa very exciting intense time and it as Isay I love those times mm-hmm you foughta lot of crises togetheryeah for sure in recent years Phil we'veseen many high-profile disruptivecompanies being pressured to rein inwhat we're seeing is aggressive machowin at all costs cultures cultures thathave brought these companies so muchearly success in their life just lastyear Nike faced some similar accusationsand the management team made some prettydecisive changes when you grow from astart-up to a 74,000 person teamhow do you preserve the best of thatwinning culture in a more complexdiverse global workforce yeah well hetouched on a lot of things there that Imean I do think that Becky's culture isa big part of its reasons for successand the culture really was formed in theearly days by the way the four peopleplus me and it still exists to this dayI'd say a lot of people say well if Philhad a dominant influence on that and hedidn'tI mean I've often said many times Nikeis young and irreverent and I'm neitherthat but it did it did to use barman'sword addict they came within a certainattitude and and it was sort of usthat's who we were and the culture hasbeen modified some and which is a goodthing and but it's still kind ofbasically there and I think it's a bigpart of its strength that yeah so I Ihope that that culture is is basicallyin place you know twenty years from nowit and and it's one thing it fits withsort of our view then and now about whata brand is you know it doesn't matterhow many people hate your brand as longas enough people love it and as long asyou have that out you can't be afraid ofoffending people you can't try and godown in the middle of the road you haveto take a stand on something which isultimately I think why the Kapernick hadworked mm-hmm well that's let's jumpinto those athletes so I want to takeyou back to 1978 Phil you stumble acrossa shy timid retiring Stanford tennisplayer by the name of John McEnroe timidI wouldn't say[Laughter]well we got to see a little bit of Johnin that video but for anyone who doesn'tknow tennis John is a young fantastictennis player who's as well known forbreaking racquets as he is breakingserve he is everything that the tennisestablishment at the time the majormajority of the market was not so whatmade him the right ambassador for Nikewell the the the story basically we hadan agreement with Jimmy Mac JimmyConnors agent for him to were in highcase shoes and he did he warm that willMelton and the agent said as soon as hegets back from Wilmington we'll get itsigned well they won one Milton and soonhe got back from Europe boy he hadsummer matches and then came the US Openand he said as soon as we get done withthe US Open we'll get this contractsigned well they won the US Open andthen we got down to sign the contractsays I don't remember it this way thatwas Jimmy Connors agent not JimmyConnorsbut that was the end of our endorsementwith Jimmy Connors and so the next yearI think it was that well I went toWilmington you know looking for the nextgreat hope and there were a bunch ofreally good American young Americans 18and under I was looking at the 18 andunders and they had Brian Godfrey who isa great player in Elliot Telstra was agreat player and the head of USA tenniswas saying those are really greatendorsements stay away from that kidMcEnroe he's too much of a hothead he'splaying over on court 14 I went right toFort 14 and basically that week he wasplaying the number 16 player in theworld filled int and he's 18 years oldand hits his first serve in and thechalk flies up and the line judge goesout McEnroe jumps over the net puts hisnose this far from the official he saysare you sure that call are you very surethat call Wow and I turned to the guyswith his this kids not afraid and youknow I kind of became a fan of hisintensity and his competitiveness andhis attitude he did lose controlsometimes but that well I alwaysremember Frank Deford rightof Hindman and Sports Illustrated whenhe said a big picture of mechanist whyisn't this man smilingBeethoven didn't smile much eitherthat's faira few years later actually several yearslater you decided to name the executivebuilding at your headquarters in Oregonafter John McEnroe what is it you weretrying to say to the team at Nike indoing that well we named all thebuildings after our heroes at the timeand you know he was one of them and thatjust that was where my office was fairenough you're glad to see him backplaying well and I that makes me feelingbetter now let's fast-forward to 1984you come across another decentbasketball players name is MichaelMichael Jordan Jordan Michael Jordanthat's it now Nike were actuallycriticized at the time for overpayingfor Jordan's signature but of coursewith hindsight he became more than anathlete he became a two and a halfbillion dollar revenue brand for Nikebeyond MJ's greatness what was it thatmade that brand so successful and sodominant yeah it's it isn't somethingyou can bottle it's been you know trulyone of the unique experiences really inall of marketing that obviously he hadit all and and we pretty much knew thatcoming in I mean he was Player of theYear he was handsome he could jumpingand that he won the nationalchampionship with a winning shot yeah atall but and yeah when we signed him wesigned him for more than any rookie hadbeen paid before was signing for$250,000 a year and fortune magazine rana little insert another article saysthere's no greater indication that Nikehas lost its way than the fact that theypaid Michael Jordan $250,000 and butthat it's but we can't combined it withwhat we thought was a really good shoe areally distinctive shoe was red andblack it wasn't just white or black andof course he wore to great and greatperformances and then we had the addedbenefit of David Stern banned it in theNBA so he immediatelymind what became a good ad says bannedin the NBA and every kid in the worldone of that and that and it's it hasn'tbeen straight uphill it had a one yearwhere sales actually went down butoverall that was the what we gottogether was really good advertisingwhich reflected his personality whichwas strong and it's been an unbelievablesuccess that when he quit playing salesof Jordan Brand product over 750 milliondollars and this last fiscal year theytopped three billion dollars and longafter he quit planned so as I said tomany people imagine how much we'd sellif he'd never played we can only dreamPhil its Nikes 55th anniversary nextweek I believe yeah the company's atrecord revenue levels and just last yearNike was voted alongside Apple as thefavored brand of Millennials and I thinkthere's a few of us in here who mightattest to that how does a brand stay sorelevant to so many people for so longwell it's it's hard work but you have towork at it all the time but I think youknow our thing obviously it starts withthe product the the product is by farmost marketing our most importantmarketing tool and so we're constantlyworking to improve product and so thekind of the recent upturn is becausewe've had a really good product pipelineprobably the react running shoe isnumber one on the list but there's beena lot of others and that so that'sthat's been really important and thenyou know good advertising is critical toit that you know that the Wieden andKennedy experience has been is in manyways as dramatic as Nikes and it'sreally been kind of a long slide eachother when I first met Dan Wyden Iwalked into the door of his quote officehe had three people besides himselfsitting around a card table and he saidwelcome to widen Kennedy and I just wantyou to know one thing I hate advertisingand he looked at me says well this wouldbe interestingand it has been but it is interestingthat you know obviously if I would havesaid that Procter & Gamble I'd have beenon they take your 25 million take your$25 advertising budget and go on at thedoor but they were a small advertisingfirm and he grew to understand that whatI didn't mean was that I hatedadvertising what I meant was I hatetraditional advertising and he foundways to find out who Nike is or whoMichael Jordan was and project that tothe consumer and not only the Nike youknow succeed Wieden and Kennedy now hasoffices all over the world you know overa thousand employees it has coca-cola asa client as Honda's a client has a lotof the world's most famous brands itsclients they've been an enormous successand to this day they work really hard attrying to find out you know who it isand who the athlete is and how toproject them I know we had Boris Beckerthe great tennis players and we weretrying to get him as an endorsement andDan Wyden was making the pitch and hesays we will find out who you are andproject that to the world and Morrissays how in the world can you know who Iam when I don't know who I amand just said well we'll find outwell we didn't we didn't make the salehe didn't we didn't get this we didn'tsell him but but that is one of thethings they've done so the advertisingand the product are two of the two thereally important things and then keepingthe product for us and keeping theadvertising fresh and it's an ongoingchallenge and we don't always hit it youknow a couple years ago we took a littledip and it's a very very competitivebusiness and in every six months is kindof a new life and everybody has to beaware that mmm Phil this is a school anda speaker series dedicated to leadershipso we want to make sure we we touch onthat topic something the MBA one classis challenged with each year is whywould someone follow you I think therecan be a stereotype of what a CEO shouldbe sometimes we think of them as anatural extrovert around the valleysometimes they can be hero likecharacters you described yourself as shyintroverted someone who identifies withthe Bournehowever those that's why that's why weget on that but but how if those traitshelped you as you built Nike well Ithink you know I mean obviouslyintroverted introverted people have atendency to listen which I think goodleaders do but when I was in school thatyou know they talked about two differenttypes of leadership they talked aboutautocratic leadership and Democraticleadership and you know it was only 15years after World War two and you knowthey had two of the great autocraticleaders everyone Douglas MacArthur andGeorge Patton and they at the timelooked on as being very successful thatthen you have a democratic styleleadership which is you know the thingis getting people involved and talkingto people and that so I think for it'sprobably almost impossible for an introto be an autocratic leader but Internetcan be a Democratic leader and the ideaof democratic leadership progressed thisis the this started to talk use the termcollaborative leadership which is reallyin my view the ultimate and only kind ofleadership to this day that in this dayand age autocratic leader doesn't workit can work for temporarily but it won'twork long run and I hope that the peoplein this in this auditorium today don'tget the idea that hero leadership meansbeing autocratic and you know that Imean obviously I think Steve Jobs haslooked at is really kind of in this areaof one whole world really has been oneof the great leaders which I believe hewas but I do believe at the end of hiscareer he was beginning to modify hisyou know natural autocratic style whichif you will got him fired his first touraround Apple and as he got to go throughApple the second time there was a changein Steve Jobs and you notice that fromthe commencement speech he gave to toStanford University and and he hired TimCook and he had a lot of give-and-takewith Tim Cook and Tim Cook who I knowquite well is very much a collaborativeleader and and I believe a greatcollaborative leader so I think that youit justdon't equate hero leadership withautocratic leadership the only Thaistyle of leadership that will work inthis day and age is collaborativeleadership mm-hmm I fell another thingyou may know about this group is thatwe're pretty touchy-feely bunch thesedays of course in your book you describebusiness as war without bullets yeah soas you look back in those early days andI keep dealing with those criseswe're solve skills tools an entrepreneurlike you could really afford back thenwhat type of what type of skills aretalking about the softer skills thetouchy-feely well I think yeah I meanyeah I think that looks you dogobviously I don't come across as atouchy-feely type and neither were anyof those top five but there's lots ofdifferent ways of communicating and Ione of the things I don't like about thepolitically correct movement is that tome it politically correct has beenfounded by people that couldn'tcommunicate and they don't want you tocommunicate very well eitherbecause communications really is a kindof an individual thing everybody's alittle bit different it's like peoplehave different fingerprints they havedifferent personalities they havedifferent emotions and I think theleaders job is to know who his team isand there's different ways tocommunicate with that teamwe weren't touchy-feely in the sensethat we were always patting each otherback and say how we feel but you couldsay how you doing today son of adidn't mean the same thing and sothere's just different ways thedifferent ways to to do they like to dothat mm-hmm I think we need to bringthat into the chatter on campus thesedaysnow Phil we we also study a lot here hadleaders act in times of crisis Nike andyourself have dealt with several todaythe Nike brand is stronger than ever butof course in the late 90s Nike did forsome time become synonymous withsweatshops and slave wages as you lookback how do you feel you handle thatcrisis what would you do differently andwhat are you most proud ofwell the one of the things that that wedidn't talk about in Business Schoolwhen I was here was the media and so Ithink probably this group is probablymuch more aware of the media but it'sit's always there it's more prevalentthan it's ever been and they're notalways consumed by facts that and sowhen they when they first charges cameat Nike run sweatshops that you knowit's a it's a really seductive argumentto say this person only makes fourdollars a day and Michael Jordan makesyou know thirty million dollars a yearand Phil Knights worth two billiondollars and and isn't this awful and butour initial reaction was that we don'trun sweatshops and that you're wrong andI was the CEO at the time and that wasmy strategy and it was awful it didn'twork and so we kind of after about ayear that it became clear and so we tookanother tack which says yeah you can youcan criticize the ones but this is whatwe're going to be and this is how we'regoing to be a better company over thenext ten years and we're going to takethese steps each year and you come lookat any of our factories anywhere in theworld that you want and we've kind ofbeen on that path ever since and that'sbasically working and I do think youknow that we have had lots of goodcomments that don't get much publicityfrom the media and you know one of thegood ones was a memberthe United Nations says Nikes the goldstandard for all apparel companies andhow they run their run their factoriesand it's a constant battle oh becausewe're always kind of looking for newfactories or changing factories and wehave most of our shoe factories and ourgood apparel collectors have been withus for 20 or 25 years but economicschange at different times so you dochange some of them on the periphery soit's a constant battle to live up to thestandards we have but we have a wholeteam at Nike that does that all the timeand basically is talking to people onthe production line all the time and Ido think that our factories are the bestin the world right now for conditionsand and it's it's a basic truth thatgreat shoes are made by great factoriesyou don't want a you know you know a badfactory making your ear the best shoesin the world that feels something elsewe hear a lot from the media but alsooccasionally at Stanford is to find andfollow your passion and you are perhapsthe example of someone who built abusiness dedicated to something theylove which is sports and athletesthere's many of us in the room today whoI feel are struggling to maybe tie ourtrue passions to a viable business orcareer what would you say to people likeus well I think you know that one thingthat is left out is that you got to havea niche you got to have a reason tosucceed my reason that was that you knowJapan could make shoes economically andthat but then the rest of it you knowfit right and home base for me so and Ido think if you're gonna be anentrepreneur it has to be something thatyou really love because there will be alot of dark days and as I say we neverhesitated in those mark dark days so I Iwas fortunate enough to find what Ithought was a niche to go with mypassion and that's that's what you needto bring those two things together butwhen you do you're very very fortunateand take advantage of it mm-hmm allright well look Phil this has beenbrilliant thus far I know Nike say thereis no finish line we do need to finishin about 15 minutes Phil this has beenbrilliant we're almost

these are 180 dollar shoes this is notsponsored we have these awesome brandnew Nike joy issues these are the latestinnovation in the race to create themost comfortable running shoe or justwalking shoe you've seen adidas boostthat came out I don't know maybe likefive six years ago and we did the easiesthey are crazy comfortable we'vepurchased so many pairs and we've alsotried the Nike epic react is that whatthey're called the epic yak shoes andthose ones are pretty good too they'repretty soft but supposedly these are 35%softer or cushier 35% then yeah35% a whole Kevin Durant softer than theepic reactoh my I get it it took me a minute yeahthat's okay sometimes there's beenchoosing the past that have come outthat we're like you know what if wedon't cut them open because what'sreally inside it is it really thatinteresting self-lacing shoes how's itfeel those are pretty cool Easy's let'slook at the inside of these guys thoseare pretty cool is there a prettyhigh-end these ones are 100% shoes thatwe should be cutting open becauseapparently there are thousands of littledippin dots like rubbery bouncy ballsinside of the sole of these shoes allthe way up here there's a bunch of ballsinside of that it looks really cool Ilove the orange on the bottom and thislittle part right here and just likewhen you're walking around you can seethe little beads inside which is so coolso what did people say it's cool and youwear these to school did anybody noticethat there yeah a lot of people noticeand they're like what are those shoesI've never seen them before those arereally cool like like feel about they'recool okaywe got both of these pairs about a monthago these ones we haven't messed withbut Lincoln has been wearing these onesyeah you see the difference yeah let'ssee do you see the difference in thatone month of wearing them and they'repretty dirtythey look pretty messed up when I firstput them onit's kind of weird cuz you'd feel theballs inside of it but it's reallycomfortable like one of my favoriteshoes that's kind of what I felt like -it feels a little strange because itreally is pouches and you're walking onthem and they move almost every timethat you walk and now is probably myconcern like this you kind of think ofit as like I don't know a beanbag if yousit on it the same place over and overagain it's just gonna have that littlespot right there and thank you says ifthat doesn't happen so anyway enoughtalking about these I want to cut thesethings open see how many beats are inthese I was thinking we cut open oneshoe we put them inside of this and weliterally like one by one count and seehow many beads are what if I was like athousand do we have to count there'smore than a thousand I bet every singleone one by one all of these all of themin one shoe there are so many is thatthere's no way[Music]all right Nike joyrides we are going tocut you open these are 180 dollars shoesand these ones have never been wornthey are nice on that side but somethings have to happen for science[Music]whoa they're like bouncy balls oh mygosh nothing everywhere okay we gottacount them all they really did put likelittle squishy toys into little tinypieces and put them down in here you'renot styrofoam but they're kind of likestyrofoam it's just like a squishy toylike you can you can compress it all theway and then it pops right back upsquish it squish it doesn't it feel likea squishy toy oh like a stress ballshe's an expert when it comes to squishyso that's that's better the stress ballthere's so many in this and on thebottom you can see now that it's outit's just like soft but it's hard to getthat open because you can see the littlepillar system it's connected prettytightly let's cut that a little bit moreyeah the little pillars are made out offoam also yeah that's starting to wonderif they're just like be they're justthey like the same material so ballswhich is the same material as this greenpart right here that's really creativeto make this is a material really softbut then also make the rest of the shoeout of that same material look at thatthere's the inside of the system okaywe're getting closeryeah I'm not a good surgeon but we'regetting closerah there we go so that's that top partyou can see the oh the middle pocketokay there's one we got to separatethese um give me another cut Lincoln itlooks like there are four pockets insideof this of the balls one of the very fartoe part one in like what do you callthat part of your foot I don't know andthen there's one right here that's inlike the mid section of your foot andthen one on the heel so four sectionsboom boom boom and they're bulging withthese stress balls after hundreds ofmiles of people running how do they notturn into like a bean bag and get wayout of shape and let gets stuck in oneposition or does water affect thesethings I don't know I'm sure Nike testedit but there's a lot of potential testsyou could do with thisfour different pouches we are going toget these inhibitors nothing else on thetable and no other beads guys whoathere's so many more than there there'sball of your foot there's so many[Music]you have to tell every one of thesenobody's ever accounted these before onYouTube when you cut up the last onefind it is there's one that reallypastor that I found it got itwe've saved it okay the last one theheel which we've already seen has a lot[Music]still some in the bottom there's likestill some right in the bottom so thisis what it looks like when it's all cutopen there's the different sections onetwo three the third one is big it's allunderneath this really squishy area andthen the fourth section it's actuallythe biggest of all of them that goes allthe way down to the bottom this is thenike Joyride pretty comfortable shoespretty unique idea and I really likethat how many balls are inside of hereno we are gonna count themI made the decision I am going to countevery single one of these and I'm gonnacount it on a long video so you can seeexactly how many there are no cheatingthey're taking them out it's gonna beexactly how many are in here but I wantyou guys to guess how many do you thinkthere's going to be and then after fourdays whoever gets it right or gets itclosest to the actual number we willcontact you and send you a brand newpair of these you only get one guess ifI look and you commented like five orsix different times or even two timesyou dishcloth just qualified you get onechance put it on there no editing howmany do you think is in here you sawlike complain with it get remote yes thevideo no no no no you can't sway themyou can't sway them they just need todecide based off of this okay say it andwe'll bleep it out and I'll put it inthe next video[Music]okay there's our guesses thanks forwatching

hi Jacoba unisport webtv and on today's menu wehave our review of the Nike magistaOprah now the magista has build up quitesome busts so today we're going to takea look at if this boot can actuallyrevolutionize the way we think aboutfootball boots so if you want to knowhow the magista Oprah performs on thepitch then you better stay right herewith me so let's look at the fit side ofthe boot because herenow you wanted to eliminate all thedistractions on the magista and sointroduced the Flyknit upper and thedynamic fit collar now because of thisnew construction some of you might beworried that the magista is tough to puton but luckily it's not as hard as itseems because basically you just gottaloosen the laces up a bit and then pullthe boot on like a regular socket andokay you got to pull a bit harder butyou get the deal and once you get theboot on you really feel that the fit issomething else now because of this reeflining material and the dynamic fitcolor you get a pretty close tight areally personal fit in the magista andit's basically like it's made to followthe shape of your foot and also nikehave applied a black inner lining whichis slightly padded so you get a verycomfortable feeling wrapping around yourfoot while also making the magista feela little bit more solid that you wouldactually think I need to boot X now theawesome thing about flying it is that itallows Nike to actually remove thetongue on the Medusa which makes theboot really hawk your foot uber tightall over basically wrapping it like asock wood and further enhancing thisfeeling are the Brio cables that go fromthe soleplate into the eye state andwhen you're pulling the laces tight youcan really feel that the beat iswrapping your foot like a sock andproviding lockdown and the cool thingwith the fact that there is laseron the magista they didn't need to bebecause the upper would still fit youwell but because of the laces you canreally pull the boot tight and adjustyourself how tight you want it to be noweven though the Brio cables work reallywell in keeping your foot on the plate Iwas looking for just a tiny bit morelockdownin the magista simply because my foottended to move just a little bit whenchanging directions with a lot of forceand I mean it's no big deal but it'sjust something I know it size wise I'dsay the magista is true to size I wasn'twith my usual size 40 and the fit ispretty much perfect both length andwidth wise but the coolest thing aboutthe magista is that the gr13 lasts thebooties bill on will accommodate both aslim and a wide foot especially becausethe fly net material will stretch to fitthe white footed playersnow the thing that really sets themagista apart from any other boot I'veever tried is the dynamic fit color andbasically it makes the magista feel morelike a part of your foot than any otherfootball boot out there but to be honestI don't think that physically it makesyour lower leg and your foot move morein unison than in say any other footpoking the thing is it feels like thatand you get that sensation mainlybecause of the closed seamless fit likethere basically are no distractionsbetween these parts of your leg and yourfoot because the magista is made to helpyou move in tight spacesit's equipped with a pee bags an islandsoleplate with mostly conical studs andalso a few bladed studs now you canactually feel that the nylon frame ispretty stiff and responsive making themagista feel like it's reacting verywell to your little bursts of speed andcombining that with the fact that nikeremoves the insole board you're reallyclose to the ground and can transferenergy from your foot to the soleplateand then ultimately the ground themagista also made me feel a bit morefree in my movements and after thinkingabout it I came to the conclusion thatit's because 19the soleplate without the mechanicalflex which basically means that my footis not forced to bend in the same areain the same way every time and when youcombine this with the stiffness and thestability from the nylon frame youactually get a very nice combinationwhere you feel you can basically burstinto any direction you want at any timegrip wise the magista just what it'ssupposed to which is help you turn ontight spaces mainly thanks to theconical studs that really give you aseamless motion through the ground whenyou're turning on the spot and I reallylike it in that aspect now as we knowmagista is made for the creativemidfielder and as a midfielder you needas much control on the ball as you canpossibly get and to do this Nike haveequip the Flyknit upper with these realcables that create this honeycomb blackpattern and that is one to give you morestability but also two to give you morefriction on the ball and we know thatmore friction needs more grip and moregrip means a bit more control but thequestion is how does it workand yeah it actually works pretty welland the touching the magista is quite aninteresting combination mostly becauseon one hand you get a pretty close tothe ball feel thanks to the thin Flyknitupper rim but then again on the otherhand it's also a bit soft and slightlypadded mostly thanks to this slightlycushioned inner lining so it's a bit ofa mix that's very very interesting nowit's not a total barefoot like feel buthaving said that you're still a lotcloser to the ball in the magista thanin other boots with similar amounts ofgripwhen it comes to shooting the magista ispretty no-nonsense there are no issuesgetting under the ball and because youhave no tongue you really get a niceclean striking surface all over theOpera but one of the best things whenstriking the ball to me is the innerlining because again it takes away a bitof this thing when you really strike theball hard and it makes it a ripepleasure because the padding is just theright combination or you can still feela lot but it doesn't hurt that muchwhen you really put your foot throughthe ball when it comes to the Briocables they're also going to give you abit of friction when you're striking theball whether you're striking it with theinside of your foot for the instep anddon't get me wrong it's not going toturn you into this world master butthere's still a nice little toolso the final verdict on the magistaobrah is that it's well it's reallyreally awesome and the fit is one of thebest I have ever tried in a footballboom similar because it fits your footso closely that is actually hard todescribe you have to try it and to putit into perspective when I went back toa conventional football team I reallymissed the closest ation off the planetand the dynamic bit color it's that goodwell what do you think about the magistaOprah and is it something for you wellleave your thoughts in the commentsection below and if you have questionswell that's the way to go swell becausethis was all I have to do for today I'llsee you later on and use the wet TVsigning off to yell so is it hard toclean the magista well for the part thathas Nike skin with a CC on it water anddirt will come right off when you wipeit with a cloth but the dynamic colorand the tongue pod is exposed the finiteis exposed so it tends to get a bit moredirty and you have to put a bit moreeffort into cleaning it off with a softbrush and the dirt is going to stay abit there so you can see it on the colorbut that's kind of the way it is I guess,17,UC8Ti6v6ZGDaOXvT4DLCQccQ,Gab Taraboulsy,41,38,0,1214,"['nike', 'nike+', 'niketown', 'believe in the run', 'racing', 'track', 'track & field', 'running', 'jogging',

you look at the history of professionalbasketball in Philadelphia Philadelphia76er went to the championship in 1977and lost to the Portland Trailblazerswent to the championship in 1980 andlost to the Los Angeles Lakers and theygot Moses Malone for 1982-1983 seasonand prior to that season Moses Malonewas wearing the franchise white Nike redswoosh perfect almost perfect 1982 who'sKilgore came up with the Nike Air ForceOne and blessed Moses Malone with thatshoe and in turn he blessed the citywith the championship in 1983so that shoe means a lot to this citybecause most Malone was that one playerPhiladelphia Sixers for one player awayand then it was Moses Moses came and hedelivered two Philadelphians to thepromised landit's called pho pho phone you say thatanywhere in the city you're 25 or olderand you like basketball you know whatthat meansfo fo-fo that's the Air Force one andthat is what Moses Malone proclaimswould be the record for 76 it was sweetfour zero four is the number and theyswept to Los Angeles Laker four games tozero the rest is historyat the time that the Air Force one hitPhiladelphia Philly was all about ballPhilly we played hard and we know how toplay and I'm not hating on the othercity cuz there's great players all overthe world but fully we do it big hereand it reflects the sneaker of the timeNike Air Force One and I say forcebecause that's what you got on the courtthe major innovation with Air Force oneis obviously in the title of the shoeitself you know the air technology Imean when we first heard there was airshoes I mean it was kind of incredible Idon't think any of us really believedthat there was air inside there and Iremember the one advertisement the AirForce One and the sole of the shoe wascutaway and did the diagram and you canactually see inside of it and they saidit was air you got to understand brosneakers made in the 70s or early 80s Imean we're really really hard on yourfeet I mean a more important thingreally at that point what used to besocks you know you look at old picturesyou see a lot of brothers with threefour sometimes five pairs of socksbecause that's what gave you yourcushioning on the concrete but when theAir Force one came out all of a suddenyou could wear one pair sock basketballshoes before 1982 we're not in modernterms comfortable they didn't offer thatcomfort or that that support thatplayers need you took a player in 2006put them in a shoe saying 80 80 81 shoethey'd be lucky if they lasted a quarterand you knowa quarter and a shoe like that theendurance and the stamina of the shoeall of a sudden changed that was therock him that's that was like what youknow raised the bar of what sneakerscould be the unique thing about Nike AirForce one is they went from being abasketball specific shoe with air a newshoe with air to issue that nowculturally is accepted worldwide peopleon other planets where Air Force OnesMartians wear Air Force one we startedselling Air Force Ones 1982 sold prettygood the guys like the soles they likejust a look of it I think what wouldreally made it was the thickness of thesole the strap they like the word air onitjust the beefiness that's the the lookthat they wanted there's a nice basiclooking shoe not too many colors if youhave the Air Force Oneyou were the Shi take back then eightytwo shoes had what they call it a runshoes will come out be out for a certainamount of time and they go awaykids in Baltimore in particular at thatpoint in time after the Air Force onehad its initial run was still coming tothe stores like you always you know canI get them once gotta get those AirForce One three retailers known as thethree amigos picked up on that havemeetings with Nike as I look why don'tyou bring back this shoot you hadCharlie Rudo sports downtown locker roomand Cinderella shoes it was Harold brutoand myself who came up with this idea ofresurrecting the Air Force one visitmeeting and I told him I wanted to bringin the Air Force Ones who would take todo it they thought we were crazythey said you guys but I believed in youguys you guys are crazy enough to askweren't were crazy enough to make it wewere forced to take twelve hundred pairof each color a white royal blue and awhite chocolate brown we took them wesold them right out the Air Force Onewas reborn this was unprecedentedwe started doing a program with Nike adifferent color each month that's whatthe shoe that my thing came fromBaltimore kids were feeling for thisshoe every month come in they're buyingevery different color where they can getthey would come up to me a paw you thinkyou can make a sky blue yeah we havethat already in the works that took itto another level this is something thatnever been done beforeback then you had almost an internetbetween New York Philadelphia Baltimoreyou had the i-95 corridor I 95 freewayexpressway link these three cities nextthing you know cats in Philadelphia inNew York getting a form oh what's goingon Baltimore and vice versa when wefound out where they were we went ohyeah people were coming down from NewYork buying shoes people were comingfrom DC buying shoes from us so the wordgot around pretty quick and it wouldhave 15 colors like Air Force Ones inWindows one all of those three timesthat's what it was we knew it wasworking we were rocking he just spreadlike wildfire this is withoutadvertising this is without nike makinga big push this is by word of mouth thisis through that internet connection thatthat preceded the digital technology byyou know decades that's where thegenesis of this whole rebirth of the AirForce one came from yeah you never knowyou sometimes you just can't figure itout it's it's like being in Las Vegasand you have the dice in your hand andyou're rolling it you just don't knowI remember I'll never forget that momentI walked into the store and I saw thesesneakers and I picked them up off thewall and I was like yo what the what artis itI was I was intrigued I wasn't sold onthem right off the bat until I waterit was the ball-playing community thatwore those sneakers off the back to playball and then it started spilling oncourt could I remember a time when wewore basketball clothes all day longlike anonyme gym shorts and everywherewe went and we had sneakers on gymshorts and a Jersey or a tank topbecause we played ball that's that's howwe live let me let me make a connectionfor you like basketball and hip-hop theythere's so intertwined it's not evenfunny like before hip-hop came along itwas nothing but basketball when we wereplaying ball like we were listening toto rap music you know and the guys thatwere involved in hip-hop you know theylove basketball a lot and play ball sothe relationship between hip-hop and andand sports period but mainly basketballis really tight into rolling meatparticularly in my life and I hadn'tgone hip-hop I'd have been a ball playerjust do it baby you know so there'salways been that connection of likehip-hop basketball New Yorkand the Styles mesh you know walkinghere is a very functional part of livingin New York you know so if you're gonnawalk you know say what do you want to beseen in the New York kid

nike has always been a brand synonymouswith innovationthink of sneaker technologies like nikeair or nike freerunor how about nike shocks technology foryears now nike has maintained this themeof matchmaking their cutting edgesneaker technologieswith elite athletes in the mid 90s thatelite athlete was none other than pennyhardaway and the sneaker technology togo along with such a talentwas none other than the beautiful odditythat is nike foamposite hello andwelcome backeveryone thank you guys so much fortuning in if you're new here my name isbrian and my brother nacho and i makevideos on sneaker historyand all things related to sneakerculture so if you're into sneakersthen you might want to considersubscribing to this channel because wemake content like this all the timeand you're not going to want to miss anupload all alright guys with that out ofthe waylet's get into the video the mid-90swere some of nike's best years as far asbasketball shoe technology is concernedmichael jordan had already had himselfan incredible career and had cementedhimself a legendthanks to this nike air or air jordanrather had become a leading world-classsneaker technology but nike wasn't goingto stop therethey wanted to innovate they needed toinnovate after all it's in the brand'sdnathis is eric avar the designerresponsible for kobe bryant's iconicsneaker lineback in the mid-90s avar was chosen tolead nike's advanced project engineeringgroupon an experimental project a project atthe time was so far-fetched that evenfellow nike designers were skepticalbut avar and his team believed that theycould pull it off there was this notionof what if you literally just dippedyour foot in this liquid bath ofmaterialand it just sucked around your foot andwhat if you could go play basketball onthat eric avar and his teamset out on a four year long journey tofulfill this vision the new technologythat they invented was what we wouldlater come to know as foam posit apolyurethane liquid that is heated andmolded to create a glove-like fit on ashoea design concept unheard of and one thatwas thought to be impossible tomanufacture at a commercial level youhave to understandthat during this era most shoes wereprimarily made of leather nubuck suedeand rubber compound it was highlyunlikely to find hard plastics on thesneakernowadays plastic can be seen on a ton ofnike's shoes but that just wasn't thecase back thenbecause of the complexity in creating amold for the shoot manufacturers wereapprehensive at working with nikebecause they thought it wouldn't bepossible to produce at scaleeric avar and his team shot the ideaaround to many manufacturers around theworld but were unsuccessfuluntil they finally found a partner andperhaps the most unlikely candidate forthe job the korean car manufacturerdaewoodaewoo solved the problem by pouring aspecial polyurethane liquid into acustom mold made for nikethis mold allegedly cost nike's 750 000to make you can imagine how this wouldreflect the price of the shoe when itreleasedbut more on that later the hard part wasover now that nike figured out how tomanufacture the shoeit was time to move on to finalizing thedesign the technology would beimplemented into two silhouettesthe foamposite one and the foampositepro both shoes were basically the sameaside from some minor aesthetic detailsthe foamposite pro featured a large nikeswoosh on the side and a swoosh at theheel tabin place of the penny one set logo andthe foamposite one had a blank upperwith the crazy phone positive designon full display how do you guys feelabout the penny hardaway one cent logo ithink it's one of the greatest logos ofall time for a basketball playerleave your thoughts below okay so we allknow that nba legend penny hardaway issynonymous with foam posits but did youknow that the shoes were originallyintended for scottie pippenlike most people scottie pippen thoughtthe shoes were ugly and turned down nikewhen they pitched it to him butas the story goes eric avar met withpenny hardaway to show himsamples for his next model at the timehardaway was just coming off theincredible success from his first twosignature shoes the nike air max pennyalso known as the penny ones and thepenny twos in preparation for his thirdshootnike brought a number of silhouettes topitch to penny but he wasn't satisfiedwith any of themuntil he saw a bag with the airfoamposite 1 prototype insidei almost hesitated to take it out but idid and he grabbed it and just goes whatis thisi said it's this concept we're workingon he just stopped me right there andsaid that's iti want that to be my next shoe now oddlyenough the shoes didn't actually releasewith their signature athlete pennyhardawayfor whatever reason nike decided it bestto debut the composites to the world onthe feet of an up-and-coming collegebasketball star by the name of mikebibbybibby wore them when he along with therest of the arizona wildcats that yearwon the ncaa 1997 championshipseveral months after penny hardawayfinally debuted the royal blue foamposits on the nba courtthe shoes actually caused a small issuewith the nba's uniform policyaccording to the league they didn'tmatch his orlando magic uniformwhile there was plenty of blue on theshoe it lacked enough black to passpenny hardaway famously colored theridges on the shoe with a black sharpiein order to be able to use them for thatdebut game nike released a foamposite 1sharpiemany years later to pay tribute to thissneaker story upon its releasenike struggled to sell the phone pauseat once this was because of a variety ofreasonsfor one the shoe was simply priced toodamn high a hundred and eighty dollarsat retail in the mid-90s was an absurdamount of moneyequally absurd was the shoe's design thefuturistic and shiny blue upper didn'tresonate with the marketit was too bizarre for most peopledespite this failed releasenike pushed ahead and continued toevolve phone positive technologyover the next several years we saw therelease of foam posit equippedbasketball sneakers like the total airfoamposite maxthe nike air flight posits 1 and 2 andit even found its way into the lebronsignature line with the zoom lebron 6and the lebron 4 modelsit wasn't until 2007 that we would seethe first ever retro for the ogfoamposite 1 in that royal blue colorwaythat we all loveeven back in 07 it still didn't hit wellwith consumers and if you really wanteda pairyou could have easily found them atdiscount retailers like nike outlet orrossyo if you picked up your phone pauses atross or at the nike outlet back in thedayi'd love to hear your story leave us acomment below as we approach the 2010sphone posits finally started to get theattention they deserve 2010 saw therelease of the coppers in other famouscolorways like the pearls and the coughdropsand over the next decade nike wouldrelease a plethora of foam posits witheach release raising the profile of thesilhouette more and moresome of my personal favorites are theeggplants the pewters the pearlized pinkcolorwayor how about the highly covetedparanorman foam positsthe supreme foams have become some ofthe most hyped releases of all time iknow there's a bunch of iconic colorwaysthat we're leaving out here buti can't go through every single one ofthem what i will not do though is skipover the holy grail of foam positsthe galaxies the galaxy foams brought alevel of hype to sneaker culture thatwas unprecedented the shoes featured agalaxy printed upperand the soles glue in the dark sneakerheads and resellers camped out for daysfor this shoeand some dude even posted his car oncraigslist saying he was willing totrade it for a pair of size 10 galaxyfoamscrazy regardless of how you feel aboutthe shoe it marked a turning

mordom trainee acts foggy little morningout there just past that fog it is thetrack this is gonna be the first outdoortrack workout I've done and we are goingto run it in the shoes that you have alljust been like Tara Tarrant Aaron arethey for real those are the Nike Flyknitfor percents yes they are for real butthere's a lot that you need to knowabout them because they are mad cheddarkind of pricey so many snow bags how amI gonna get to the track before youspend that kind of dough watch thisreview[Music]Wowtraining axe that was not a pile ofquality work before I get to talkingabout the Nike Flyknit look at what Iwas trying to knock out hard efforts inthink I'm about a week too early onInstagram I'll put up a video with thedescription for that entire speedworkout is like 35 minutes but if thereweren't snow it'd be a good quality 35minutes that you could do all rightthese babies all right trainee axe let'stalk about the Nike Vapor fly fly knit4% that's not easy to say all right sowe've got to talk about the twoelephants in the room number one theseare taking over the running world andthere is a ton of hype there probablyhasn't been a more hyped shoe and aslong as I can think and the second thingis they're expensive they are twohundred and fifty dollars u.s. probablythe most expensive shoe and there'ssomething I'm gonna explain thatprobably makes them an even moreexpensive shoe when you consider itregarding the hype for this there havebeen races that over half the field hadthis shoe lined up in transition when Iwas talking to cam Werth in LA he wastalking about the fact where as long asyou don't have a competing shoe sponsorhe was like why would anyone wearanything but this the science just goesto support this I'll get into a lot ofthat so the specs this is a road racingshoe from Nike it is 6.9 ounces in aimsize 9 that is also a woman's shoebecause these are unisex shoes it is abig heel to toe drop with a 31millimetre heel and a 21 millimeterforefoot so if you are somebody who hastraditionally run on a flat shoe this isgonna feel a little bit weird but stillworks explain why so as far as claims ofthe speed the name of it is the Nike 4%and then it's claiming that it's goingto make you 4% faster or 4% moreefficient what I heard from people thatwere testing this before it came out isthat actually at Nike it was more like3.1 percent and that's what everyone washearing was 3.1 percent and then it cameout and they were like oh they roundedup from three point one to four that'snot how rounding works Nike but there'sstill a lot of science to back this upand one study that was published in theJournal of Sports Medicine 18 runnerswere tested at anywhere from about 5:21per mile to he was 653 per mile andtheir efficiency in this shoe versus twoother popular shoes was measured andthat efficiency in every single one ofthe runners regardless of whether theywere a heel striker or a forefootstriker increased anywhere from about1.6 percent to about six point threepercent clustering around four percentmore efficient now the mechanism thatcreates that efficiency is one theenergy return and that is a function ofhow much energy comes into the shoe fromlanding and instead of dissipating outthe side of the shoe with heat itactually gets returned to moving youforward now most shoes out there on themarket are somewhere in between about 50and 65 percent energy return going intopushing you forward the previous leadingshoe was the adidas boost which measuredin the high 70s this measured anall-time high of 80 efficiency though isreally just a measurehow much workload does it take for youto move yourself forward and energyreturn it's not a perfect science we'remore energy return means that you gofaster so in testing practicallyspeaking what does this actually do wehad a guy that is here locally that heis a complete data junkie and he didtesting against this versus all of hisother favorite shoes and he found thatthis was four seconds faster perkilometer or six and a half secondsfaster per mile and I basically foundthat same thing that at the sameperceived effort somewhere around fourto eight seconds faster feels the samesecret is two things one is that zoomxfoam by Nike at the bottom that isdesigned to be a cushy so it takes aload off your body and it's still nicetowards the end of a half marathon or amarathon but B also is very springy soit shoots you forward there's also acarbon plate that goes through theentire shoe and as you can see it's areally stiff shoe so that carbon plateis designed to load up tension and snapyou forward shooting you forward in thedirection that you want to go instead ofhaving all that energy dissipate out theside love you back all the science asidemy experience with them has been reallygood I use them for a few training runsleading into Half Ironman Puerto Ricoand then in half ironman Puerto Rico Ifound that they certainly helped so theywere faster in those training runs Iwasn't necessarily very fast in PuertoRico but if you look at the data from mystride running foot pod what you can seeis that my form didn't really break downI've never had a half marathon in a HalfIronman where I stayed with the sameform throughout the entire course of therace so I think that's a function ofbeing more efficient and this foamtaking a little bit of load off my bodyI found that the best feeling that I gotfrom this shoe is around say 10k racepace or up to marathon race pace Ididn't really like it for like thatsuperfast 200-meter effort or a onekilometer like twitchy fast whereeverything's flailing because it's likethis was too stiff to really let my bodyfunction naturally so it was like thatthat difficult tempo pace that I reallyliked also the sole on this is reallyreally basic it is not designed forreally anything besides the track orroad running don't be using this ongravel off-road trails not what it's foras far as durability it's not gonna be avery durable shoe this is a race shoethis has been stated by Nike to besomewhere around a hundred mile shoe andif you look at forums online everyone'ssaying that around mile 80 hundred onehundred and fifteen but it starts losingits springiness now when you combinethat with the fact that it's a $250 shoeit's probably the most expensive dollarper mile shoe out there and that's justfact like it's made with this zoomx foamis actually pee backs foam pee backsPemex foam which is known for being veryforgiving very springybut degrading fairly quickly and thelast thing with regards to sizing if youdo end up choosing to get these go atleast one half size up with a thin sockone half size is perfect for me with athick sock it's starting to even stillget a little bit tight now the questionis should you buy this now going back wehaven't done this in a few weeks on thetrainee ak heads scale of zero to fivewhere zero is I don't really recommendanyone buy this at all but five is everysingle athlete should buy this I wouldactually give this a 2 out of 5 and theonly reason that I'm giving it such alow number is because it is so stinkinexpensive now that's not to say thatit's not a good shoe it's legit it doesexactly what it's supposed to do Ireally likeI'm probably going to run in it but noteveryone needs this shoe so that tonumber is an indication of it being agreat product but it's for a very niceit's for somebody who not only hasmultiple shoes somebody who wants a veryfast shoe for certain periods of timebut somebody who wants the best possibleshoe that they can get and somebodythat's moving fairly quickly if you'resomebody that's doing a race that youare slower than call it eight minutemiles eight thirty miles I don't know ifyou're gonna get the bang for the buckout of this so this is a very me sheshoe but for the right person it's agreat shoe I'm probably gonna be buyinga few of these over the next few years Ilike it a lot it's just damn expensivethere you go trainee acts that is theNike Vapor fly fly net four percent it'slegit and if you got the Chetta for itand the speed and the desire to get thebest shoe out there go for it I like itit looks slick it feels good just feellike I'm holding a precious item that isdisintegrating every single time I puther course later trainee axe hit thesubscribe button

hi so how do you tell the differencebetween an authentic 4-port opportunityor a fake one so today I'm going to showyou an authentic Barcelona 2015 2016Jersey that I bought online from areputable place versus a fake one that Ibought in laughs now one of the keydifferences obviously is going to beprice so that looks too good to be trueit probably isfor example this Jersey cost 150 USdollars online and the fake one was wasless than 10 US dollars at a store inLaos the other thing is going to be thefit of it so Mike actually makes twodifferent versions themselves it'salmost like they rip themselves off theymake what they call the the match orperformance or player shoe which isbasically the same Jersey that theplayers wear on the pitch and then theymake one that they call Stadium which isfor the fans it's cheaper it's alsobigger so this the match one is atighter fit for athletic bodies I preferthat being a fairly fit person the Ifind that the size small in theirstadium version is is too big in a bitbaggy whereas this is so small in the inthe match version as you can see it fitsquite snug and tightly you know I'll putthe Y over on to show you the differenceokay so this is the fake the knockoffversion of the of the Barcelona awayJersey obviously the one I was wearingwas their their home jersey and this isa knockoff of the authentic or or asMike calls it the match Jersey and asyou can see it's a lot more baggy that'snot quite as quite a fit it's probablyit probably is still a tighter tighterfit than the Mike official stadiumversion cuz I mean they're even biggerstill but I'm going to show you a fewmore detail differences as well okay sothe main differences between thesequality andpurely used and if you had a littletricks that I'll show you as welland it's also going to pen on the thequality of the paper this is a prettygood quality fake but it's actually Isuppose more similar to like stone ripoff the stadium version then the actualauthentic version on the 2015 version ofthe night soccer or football jerseysthey have these ventilation holes in theback seal is now on the real stadium orhome sorry the real match version youcan see that these five holes at theback of all got a lining to reinforceand strengthen them and the same withthe holes on the sleeve the other thingyou'll notice is that there's differentmaterial so if you hold hold this up tothe light you can see see through thismaterial here on the inside it's a bitof quite hollow weave for aeration andit's actually going to a differentmaterial at the top here at the back ofthe neck so it still has the holes butas you can see there's no noreinforcement around those holes on theinside there's the holes and also thethe fabric is pretty much the samefabric at the top here as it is downhere it's not you can't see through itas easily how does a lot of aerated onthe authentic match version you can seethey've got an extra layer of it's likea film here that goes over the seam soit's like a heat press seam it's notstitched this is on the inside of thecollar where is on on the knockoff youknow you've just got stitching thereas you can see the difference betweenthe the yellow knockoff here and theauthentic mic one here also if you lookat the stitching on the band down theside so the originals or the authenticmic one has got it doubled overstitching it's quite neat and tidywhereas the fete completely differentit's a much cheaper type of teaching nowthe other thing is the type of materialits use down this side on the fakeversion it's the same material all theway down all the way to the sleevewhereas on the the real like oneit starts with similar sort of materialbut then the holes get bigger as youmake your way to the sleeve then they'requite large holes there and again hereyou can see that material on the sleevesis slightly different to the material onthe shirt itself another thing is thestitching just around the whole outsideso this is the the bottom of the Jerseyso you can see it's got two two rows ofstitching their particular style but thefabric is just being cut and thestitching put across whereas on theauthentic one the to do it's only onerow of stitching but the fabrics beingfolded under and stitched along so itleaves a lot smoother and it's not gonnafray and that's along the bottom andalso the same thing around the sleevesit's being folded under there's on thesleeves of the fake again it's justbeing cut off so you can see that littleflap there another good point is thetags so on this tag you'll see this isthe authentic one the numbers on herethe style the color number andnow if you look at the tag on the insideof the jersey so it's got that same samenumber they're the six five eight sevennine zero and the four two two and it'sgot the s up there for small inside someof the ones I've seen do it's just gotthese larger tags yes another feature isthese authentic tags that night puts onhere so on the match versions then likeauthentic tags are gold on the stadiumversions they're actually silver now oneof the key differences you can see hereis that the fake ones actually stitchedon whereas the authentic ones actuallyheat pressed on the numbers are similarthis is sort of like a realistic numberso it looks like it could be real if thenumbers are too low then it could be afake as well the other thing I noticedwas that when I was in the store Ipicked up this Jersey I compared thisnumber on here against some otherjerseys that they had there there was aParis Milan Jersey and actually had theexact same number so that you know theforgers are going to make one of thesetags with the exact same number butprint heaps of them and put them on allthe tracks so if you if you're gettingonline you can't necessarily look at allwe have the jerseys there but if they'vegot photographs of the tags then youmight get a tell if they're all the samenumber across different clubs then thatobviously means they're fake now thematerial that's used in this fake is isprobably similar in feel to thematerials used in Mike's stadium versionso don't get confused between this andthe and the official mack stadiumversion because the night stadiumversion is the same material down theinside here as well rather than havingthe changes on on the match version okayso if we go to the logo itself noticethey both look very similar in this casethe I think the yellow here on the onthe fake is a bit off it's a bitbrighter than it is on the authenticMike one other thing is that it's it'squite soft and thin it's really easy tofold hasn't got a lot of stiffness to itwhereas the authentic ones got quite abit of stiffness and bulk to it otherthing is the the printing on the shirtso this is the Qatar Airways logono it's it's quite thin as well and itdoesn't have any little plastic coatingover it it's quite easy to fold whereasthe on the authentic one if you lookclosely it's got a little clear plasticcoating around the edge and it's quitestiff so that it's not folding as easilyit's quite thick and that's the same onthe sleeves so the logo on the sleevethe same sort of thing look at thatclosely you can see the the clear bitover the top is a quite smooth and yeahthe UNICEF logo on the backso it's the stiffer feel I'm comparisonto the the fake it's quite soft okay soanother thing to note is the quality ofour stitching inside the neck so insideyeah you can see that inside the neck atthe front this is the authentic versiondoes it's got the stitching around thetop here but the folded Euler piece offabric is actually glued or heat bondedtogether there you can see a little bitof some sort of plastic in material overthe edge there whereas on the fake youknow it's different stitching up herebut this is just folded over it's reallynot a poor quality in comparisonstitching the fake you know thestitching there is quite thick and solidbut there's not much of a gap betweenthe letters whereas the the authenticit's actually a finer stitched in thereit's thicker and it's got a bit of aspace between it so it's see the twoside-by-side you can see that theauthentic blue one there it's a bit of athinner stitching as far as the boldnessof the the letters themselves and a bitmore of a gap between the letters okayso another thing on the authentic one onthe sleeve here sorryfrom so then on the inside snow putthere well so you've got the dots acrosson the sleeve and on this one youactually got a hole this one thatactually got a whole panel stitched onhere whereas with the authentic one it'sthe same piece of fabric let's just gotthe darts in there on the peg on thesleeve it's a separate panel just inthere so yeah those are the maindifferences don't get confused betweenthe knife match and the knife stadiumbut this is a official knife matchplayer issue and this is a knockoff Mikematch issue so those are the sorts ofthings to look for when you're trying tospot a fake like soccer or footballjersey so I hope this video has beenhelpful to you thanks for watching,1,UCBivXjZjBg-E7dwK1euP_Zg,Needhi Parekh,1,23,0,74,['iMovie'],Nike Commercial 30

have a BAE not right nowbut after she tastes it she will be gayyou feel me how long have you been awareof nutrition as far as functionality hestarted playing golf at 4 I know it foryou weren't thinking about nutrition andno I mean carbs no like 20 years agothere's nothing there wasn't much aboutnutritiongrowing up I was quite the chunky kidfast food was my main source oh that'sbecause parents didn't know we didn'tknow we thought you know it's all it'sall good for you and then I got injuredI was 17 I broke you know three bones inmy left hand and end up taking you knowa lot of you know painkillers to playthe doctor prescribed me but I was likeyoung and I end up getting an ulcer hmmso since then I've been very aware aboutwhat I put into my body that created allthese like food sensitivities just morethan digesting things the same way andthen I started realizing I need to eatbetter I need to actually pay attentionwhat I put into my body I was soinflamed I need to do things to decreaseinflammationI'm just why I started to eat like thisand then I got really really strict Ialmost got like too strict Mo's writingthings down everything I ate almost gotlike a little bit too obsessed with itby writing what the fat in the car yeahcalories a little journal exactly it'sjust too much so now I'm like trying tofind like a good balance of just beingaware you can get stuck in a you know aphase where you eat bad and your bodyfeels bad but then you're like ignoringthe signs they're ignoring your bodycommunicating whereas if you listen toit then you can kind of get your back ontrack and if you are on track you feelgreat this one is specifically for youwhy you saw and what looks ten hands onhips dobeing a sports person being in the gameis all about how can you make it betterfor the next generation and to go offhas such a stigma but the way I knowit's such a cool sport and having itbeing the Olympics was a big step justbecause it opens a game up to so manycountries I haven't even been in thegame before and because if you thinkabout it people that just start golfwhere do they even start so I want toyou know inform people a fun place sothere's golf courses where my friendsbrings our dogs to or you know like canbring their kids to so if we could makethat a little bit easier and moreaccessible hmm I think that we can get alot more people into the game you saw mecooking I just like feel it you know andthen oh how I play golf as well too Imean you know you know if you have theright club in your hand like you knowyeah and you have to make a consciousdecision to do things that make youhappy and cooking's definitely one ofthem for me I love food I love eating itI love making as well as I feel moreinto the process and once I eat it it'smore fulfilling and that's something Ireally didn't you know hone into a lot Ithink a lot of people don't reallyrealize that as much as it is about thenumbers and articles and all theinformation you have to trust your gutyeah exactlyall right don't test that plate that'smine what is a chunk what is a chunkthat's when you fart and it comes with alittle some extra everybody's had achunk my godno one's undefeatedclick

today we're going to be going over theconcepts mallard turdunken whatever youmay call itnike sb dunk high set to release laterthis weekthis is the one from concepts so it hasthe special packagingand i wanted to make sure that you guysgot a special look at this one inparticularjust because of this dope packaging[Music]welcome back to the channel what's upwith you guys how you doing how you beenif you did not know by nowmy name is dj and this is the dna shownow if you haven't already make sure youhit the subscribe button hit the bellnotification for every time i upload anew videodon't forget to smash the like buttonbecause that helps the algorithm oh somuch so i was able to get my hands onthese early to give you guys a reviewcourtesy of my bro jmac so make sure yougo check out his podcastand don't forget to follow him on ig aswell tell him dj sent you solet's go ahead and get into this becausewe have a lot to go over starting withthe box this is the shipping box thatyou will receivein the mail if you were able to orderthis from conceptsnow this was available last week he gotthis from the concepts websiteretail was roughly around 250 bucks andas you know that's a lot more than youwould typically pay for a pair ofsbs but at the same time you are payingfor the experience and the packagingand everything that comes with this pairin particular compared to the 120 dollarprice point that you would see onsneakers app so looking at the box righthere it has all the same stuffall around the box and on the box itreads concepts oven on fireroast your friends in front of theirfriends and then it has a bunch ofdifferent random stuff on herehigh quality h2o just and it's earlydon't smoke crack don't you can coldcereali think who's okay so there's a bunch alot of random words right here i don'tknow if this is some like puzzle orsomething that they've createdto make i don't know this is likesomething that they got going on but yesthis has a lot of weird words on it soenough of that let's go ahead and crackthis box open and see what's insideso first thing right here we have theovenvibes of the box so looking at the boxright here it looks like an oven whichis crazy like the concept behind thisaloneand i know the place is called conceptso i'm gonna say concept a lotbut this is just honestly a dope conceptandif you look back here on this side it'sjust like smoking and everythingbut if you look on the front side of itright here it has all the sizes andeverything right here in the frontso we are looking at a size 10 and ahalfand it says concepts x nike sb dunk hightur duncanokay now opening this up right here bruhquality is there for sure it's like it'sallis there like a magnet on here orsomething i don't know but the materialeverything the qualityeverything behind that alone a1 for surefirst thing that we have on top righthereyou have your nerf packaging you gotyour uhpie you got some corn with butter yougot yourmashed potatoes and gravy and then yougot the turkey football right hereon the inside so it's got the nerf withthe concepts on the back right hereand then you got the nerf whistle ballso as you know it's got the thanksgivingvibes and typically on thanksgiving youplay in a turkey bowl so they had toincorporate the footballand me personally i really love thattouch so the next thing right here wehave a piece of paper which is supposedto represent the turkeyand on that it has a concept logo and itsays concepts as wellas you can see right here and then afterthat we got the shoe so i'm thinkingthis might be a special boxjust for this specific release as weknow typically on sb's when they have aspecial releasethey typically do the rainbow box andthen when they have the regular releaseto the publicthey do just a regular sb box i hopethey do the rainbow box for the regularrelease as wellwe shall see so on the inside of thisbox right here it's kind of dope becauseyou got the burnerbut it also could look like the c forthe concepts logo which is super dopeyou got the fire everything going insideright here where the turkey cooks sothe presentation alone just a1 like theydid a great joband typically on sneakers you get youknow a couple pair of laces or somethingmay go with it or the box may look alittle bit cool butthis is an experience you're literallypurchasing an experienceand this is something that you couldshow all your friends when they comeover and like bro check this out andthey gotta do this andi think when there's so many steps toopening just to get to a pair of shoesi think that's always dope i knowsometimes it can get a little tediousbut at the same timei think you're paying for thatexperience and for the 250 buckssaying that the shoe is worth so muchwhich we'll talk about later on theresale valuei think it's worth it okay so we haveseen the packaging and now it's time tolook at the shoes so like i said beforewe have the all-over rainbow print boxand then on the tag right here reads thesame thing nike sb dunk high proquick strike size 10 and a half retail120 bucksnow that's for the regular pair withoutall the packagingbut this dunk is still a regular sb dunkwhich retails at 120 bucksnow opening up the box you have an extrapair of socks right hereokay with the concept stitch right herei'm assuming this is supposed to be likea bird's leg you got the bird's legright here with the claw down here atthe end of the socksretail on these is dollars i think thisall comes in the same packagingand let's go ahead and get into thisshoe oh we got the shoeokay so first impressions of this shoehonestly i was more excited aboutthe packaging than i am the actual shoejust becauseit's just not for me i appreciateall of the work that went into this shoetrust mei appreciate the materials they lookamazingwhich we will get into a second but formei just don't see myself rocking theseand i wouldn't mind if i did or didn'tget them or not soas i i know i know it's not the popularopinion so let's go ahead and startbreaking down this shoe let's talk aboutthe styles cuts and materials the thingsthat i do appreciate about the shoeand then we'll see what you guys thinkat the end of the video with the polestarting with the outsole you have yourclassic nike sboutsole you got kind of like a two-tonewith a little light tan and kind of likethat salmon kind of color right there toitand then working our way up to themidsole you got a lighter kind of pinkcolorway on the midsole with the pinkcolored stitchand then going to the upper now theupper is mixed with a bunch of differentmaterialsand i appreciate everything about theshoe again i am not knocking this shoeat all so these are supposed torepresent a mallard duck if you don'tknow what it looks like here's a picturefor you to check it out but basicallythat's the kind of concept and vibe thatthey're going behind itto create this shoe and i understand andi appreciateall of the execution and everythingabout these bruh like honestlythey did a great job and when i seenfirst images of the shoei think that's what really made me notlike it as much because even if you lookat the image on sneakers appthey don't look nearly good as they doin person materialseverything quality a1 presentation a1they did a great job on this shoelooking at the toe cap right here youkind of got like a shaggy materialaround the front you got a light tansuede toe cap here on the toplooking at the mid foot on the sidepanels you kind of got that ductmaterial kind of looking like it's aduck featheron the sides right here on both sidesand then you have a navy blue swoosh onthe inside of the foot it's kind of gotthat green iridescent vibe compared tothe blue on the outside the swooshesalmost look like they're 3m but they'reactually not going to the back of thefoot right here you got a softer vibe onthe materialkind of feels like a little teddy bearor something like that you got a nicelittle suede on the back end of the hillright hereand then you got a white sock liner andon the inside you got images of duckstrees and the logos concept right hereon the inside of the sock linerthe white leather bruh this is nicegoing to the tongue you have anall green tongue similar to the swooshon the inside of the footyou got a yellow leather nike sb logotab right heresays duck high pro instead of dunk highproi think that's pretty dope you have tanlaces that come equipped with the shoesalreadyyou have an additional pair of yellowlaces and a pair of burgundy laces to gowith these as welllet me know what color laces you wererocking these down below in the commentsection so here's the questiondj if you like all these things aboutthe shoe and the presentation and allthat stuffwhy are you still hating on it why don'tyou like it honestly like i saidit's just a very i don't know likemaybe a collector's piece but it's justnot hitting home for mei don't like hunting ducks you know it'sjust i don't know it's just not for meandi could respect a lot of shoes out inthis world that's just not for me soi think there's a lot of hype behind theresale price and that's why there's ademand for this sneakerand causing people want to have it andhonestly for 120 dollarswith the materials and everything thatthey did to this shoe if i could buythese for retaili could see myself hanging on to themjust because i got them for 120 bucksjust based off of the materials and howwell they did on the shoebut i would never ever ever pay resalefor a sneaker like thisjust to say that i had it i think that'skind of where it divides the line on thefence for meyeah i wouldn't mind grabbing it forretail just for the story and theconcept and everything behind it and thematerials and the presentationbut i would just never want to no i justcouldn't do it likethere's certain shoes that i'm down todo that and this is not one honestly ifeel like there's no right or wronganswer it's all based on everybody'sopinion how they feel and what they wantyou got to spend your money i got tospend mineand i'm just telling you right now i'mwilling to spend 120 but i'm never goingto pay resale for something like this sonow let's see what the people aretalking about typically i post on mystory if you haven't already make sureyou follow me on ig but i post on mystoryis the shoe fire or trash and i see whatthe people say and then i'll post theresults on hereso this is what the people say well itlooks like they got a perfect score69 to 31.the majority of the people ended upgoing with these and i completelyunderstand there's a lot of things toappreciate about this shoeand it makes a lot of sense but there'sa lot of people that are like they wantsomething simple they don't want toomuch and this may be just a little bittoo much for themor maybe it's hard for them to rock andmaybe it's just a collector piece idon't knowi like sb's i really do but again youknow what i'm saying i don't knowmaybe type of thing so so what i justsaid right there in that last twoseconds i don't know if any of that madesense but that was my explanation abouthow i felt about these so i hope youguys
