plus dollarbrandwhich is like out of this world becauseit was only eightyears ago pretty much the day i was likehand sewing and hand making and handprinting products andhand packaging them and sticking it intoa bag and carrying it down to the postoffice andstanding there whilst each one wasstamped and sent out across the worldandto go from thatto a billion dollar brand or more than abillion dollar brand it's justinsane and like it's a this is a reallyweirdmoment i'm really not realizing rightnowjust how far we've come we've literallycome from hand stitching product tobeing a billion dollar brandi'm so happy with how far we've come buti'm somuch more excited about how much furtherwe've got to go[Music]today i wanted to be completelytransparent with you guys and i wantedto record a full video talking throughwhat's been going on over the last fewmonths what the shareholding looks likenowand what our future plans are here atgymshark to make sure that this isone of the biggest and ultimately thebest fitness brand in the entire worldso this process gymshark is bringing oninvestors ultimately and i know what alot of you guys will thinkis ben selling out is this going tochange the businessabsolutely not all we're doing here iswe're just formalizing the sort of sharestructure of the businessthere's been a reorganization which i'lltalk you guys through in a minute whichis brilliant for the businessso if anything you'll see jim shark evenmore agile than everi'm going to have even more input andcontrol over the future of the businessand ultimately it's all about makingsure that jim sharp continues on itsrocket ship growth trajectorycontinues to build out what we believethe future of brands and fitnesscommunities look likeand end up becoming a truly truly globalbrandif i go back to when i founded thisbusiness right i was very youngi didn't really know what i was doing inthis world all i knewis that i had a dream of being involvedin fitness and i had a vision in termsof how i believe thatbrands particularly in the space shouldinteract with people how communitiesworkand i ultimately had all thedifficulties of going to the gym thefirst timefeeling like everyone's staring at younot really knowing what to doi felt like the clothes just weren'tright for me and ultimately that's whenwe ended upgoing off and making our own clothesright and that's how gymshark startedwe realized very quickly that we're onto something brilliant and it was atthis point that jim sharp startedbecoming a lot more of a business rightwe started to hire staff and we startedto build out a more formal processand it was at this point at 21 years oldi think it wasi realized that i was really good atcertain thingsand really really bad at others and itwas at this pointthat we brought on paul and steve whohavecompletely and utterly revolutionizedthe business andalbeit looking back that seems a veryobvious decision to make and to be fairi'vereceived a lot of credit in terms ofbringing those people on in terms ofremoving myself from the chief exec roleand steve coming in and really managingthe day-to-day of the business and iremember in terms of albeit the verysmall amount of people that were workingat gymshark at the timethere was a lot of people that werequestioning that decision and ultimatelymy gut instinct told me it was the rightthing to do because it would helpdevelop and grow the business and thebrand it would allow me to focus on whati'm really good at but also allow me tolearn in the areas that i'm not good atgive me a little bit of a safety blanketwhich would allow me to fail in theareas that i'm weak at because paul andsteve would cover those gapsand ultimately the decision was aboutcontinuing to grow and build thebusiness in the right wayso since those guys have joined it'sbeen about five or six years and it'sbeen an amazing five or six yearsyou know there's been ups there's beendowns about five years ago lewis leftthe business whoi co-founded the business with it justwasn't right for him it wasn't workingso he sort of left which i'll come backto in a momentso yeah it's been a huge learning curveand just albeitbelieve me it's incredible and igenuinely think i have the best job inthe worldthere's been some incredibly difficultmoments on that journey as welland i have to thank both my friends myfamily and all the people around me hereat gymshark that have helped me getthrough thatso i think at that point at the point oflewis leaving i think we were in therevenues of about 10 to 12 millionpoundsnow we're well into the 300 plus milliondollars 250 260 million pounds lastyear so the growth has just beenabsolutelyhuge and i've always said to you guysthati always want to take every single leappossible to take this into being one ofthe biggest and best brands in the worldand i think it would be remiss of me tonot continue to bring in the rightpeople that will helpelevate us to that next level ultimatelywe want to keep pushing forwardand creating and building what webelieve the future of what brands looklikeso a year ago we made the decision tobring on an investor and this has been areally longconsidered and steady process we haven'trushed it whatsoeverbecause we know that this is one of themost important decisions that we'regoing to makeas we move forward so going into this weweren't looking necessarily the highestvalue obviously we wantedfair value but ultimately we needed theright cultural fitand we needed the company that we feltwould really and truly helpgrow jim shark in the right way into atruly global brandand i say in the right way because theold playbook for successin in brands was you create as muchproduct as you canto put into as many stores as you can toplease as many people as you canand that was really good for fast growthbut ultimately that led to big slowclunky businessesthat didn't truly understand theirconsumer and had no control over theconsumer experienceor their data but we needed someone thatreally truly understood and aligned withour vision of how we want to growgymsharkbecause we don't necessarily want togrow gymshark in the quickest way wewant to grow it in a way that we feel isrightboth given out morals our values butultimately where the the market is goingand where we think the future of brandsshould be so i'm absolutely buzzing totell youthat we are signing with a companycalled general atlantic andwe saw a lot of companies and there wasa brilliant three companies at the endthat we were working with and they wereabsolutely brilliant but generalatlantic particularlygabe and melis the first time we metthemthey just got this brand they completelyunderstand where we want to get toand just culturally they were just deadon like it was one of those momentsright it's like when you knowyou know and we 100 new with these guysandthese people this company will trulyhelp us grow that will help us developin the right wayso one of the questions that i am boundto get the mostis going to be around shareholding whatdoes this look like benny you sellingoutare you reducing your shareholding allthis sort of stuff andthe the short answer is no and i'llexplainhow and why in a minute right sopreviously jim shark shareholding as ofseveral weeks ago and it's been this wayover the last five or six yearsi own 67 of the business lewis who ico-founded the business with owned 20of the business and the rest was splitbetween paul and steve essentiallybetween six and seven percent and thatwas the structure of the business andthat was great for me because i hadmajority shareholdingi could really push forward with the waythat the brand was movingbut like i said ultimately lewis leftthe business years ago so as we wentinto this process i gave lewis call andi said listenwe're looking at doing this and he cameback to me and he said i want to crackon i want to move on i want to deal withthe thingsand the result with that i'd like tosell all of my shareholding sofortunately which is you know it's greatfor everyone if we're buzzing becausenow thatsort of frees up that extra shareholderthan we've got in the business sothe new shareholding will look somethingroughly like thisso general atlantic will have a bit over20 so it's gonna be around 21of the business i will have 70 so i'mactually increasing my shareholding herefrom 67to 70 which i'm really really excitedabout so general atlantic will be our21 i'll be a little over 70 and mybrother joeis also going to have about one percentshareholding in the business as he wasemployed number one and he's just anintegral part of this business and thenthe rest of it is split betweenall the leadership team noel nirenperrinsgemma dave philip and obviously paul andsteve as well will still holdshareholdings in this business goingforward so that's the utterly completelytransparent viewculturally will the business changeabsolutely not if anything it will justget better and bettergeneral atlantic will continue toamplify the culture in this business andthat's what i'm so excited about rightisamplifying this culture making sure thatwe maintain it as we continue to growbecause we really are in unknownterritory here rightgymshark is a 1.45 billion dollar brandwe're doing 300 plus 400 million revenuein the next sort of 12 monthsthis is a rapidly growing brand peoplehaven't been in this situation beforethe old playbook has been thrown out thewindowand we're going on this grove journey ina completely different way to whatanyone else has ever done it beforeand you know who knows where it willtake us what you'll often see inbusinesses especially when they get tothis sort of sizeis business growth or business sizeincreases and transparency decreaseswhereas the important thing for meleading this business having foundedthis businessis that as the business gets biggertransparency almost increasesi want to be completely transparent withyou guys andi've had a lot of feedback in terms ofhow great it is that we are being sotransparentpreviously but i know that no one is astransparent as what we arenow certainly for the size that we're atbut ultimately to summarize we've got anincredible partner they're a greatcultural fit they're going to helpamplify the gymshark brand and help usto continue to grow the shareholder ismuch top more tidy nowwhich i'm really really happy about andit gives me more control in thisbusiness and its direction than i thinki've ever hadin terms of our growth going forwardnorth america north americanorth

we wentinto this process i gave lewis call andi said listenwe're looking at doing this and he cameback to me and he said i want to crackon i want to move on i want to deal withthe thingsand the result with that i'd like tosell all of my shareholding sofortunately which is you know it's greatfor everyone if we're buzzing becausenow thatsort of frees up that extra shareholderthan we've got in the business sothe new shareholding will look somethingroughly like thisso general atlantic will have a bit over20 so it's gonna be around 21of the business i will have 70 so i'mactually increasing my shareholding herefrom 67to 70 which i'm really really excitedabout so general atlantic will be our21 i'll be a little over 70 and mybrother joeis also going to have about one percentshareholding in the business as he wasemployed number one and he's just anintegral part of this business and thenthe rest of it is split betweenall the leadership team noel nirenperrinsgemma dave philip and obviously paul andsteve as well will still holdshareholdings in this business goingforward so that's the utterly completelytransparent viewculturally will the business changeabsolutely not if anything it will justget better and bettergeneral atlantic will continue toamplify the culture in this business andthat's what i'm so excited about rightisamplifying this culture making sure thatwe maintain it as we continue to growbecause we really are in unknownterritory here rightgymshark is a 1.45 billion dollar brandwe're doing 300 plus 400 million revenuein the next sort of 12 monthsthis is a rapidly growing brand peoplehaven't been in this situation beforethe old playbook has been thrown out thewindowand we're going on this grove journey ina completely different way to whatanyone else has ever done it beforeand you know who knows where it willtake us what you'll often see inbusinesses especially when they get tothis sort of sizeis business growth or business sizeincreases and transparency decreaseswhereas the important thing for meleading this business having foundedthis businessis that as the business gets biggertransparency almost increasesi want to be completely transparent withyou guys andi've had a lot of feedback in terms ofhow great it is that we are being sotransparentpreviously but i know that no one is astransparent as what we arenow certainly for the size that we're atbut ultimately to summarize we've got anincredible partner they're a greatcultural fit they're going to helpamplify the gymshark brand and help usto continue to grow the shareholder ismuch top more tidy nowwhich i'm really really happy about andit gives me more control in thisbusiness and its direction than i thinki've ever hadin terms of our growth going forwardnorth america north americanorth america that is a huge opportunityfor us and aboutthree weeks ago i was supposed to get aone-way flight to denver coloradome and robin were going to move outthere i was going to head up the u.sofficebut then kobe got in the way and that'sbeenessentially delayed until further noticeso yeah we're opening the denver officewe've got two distribution centersopening in america as well we've alreadyopened our canadian one in torontothere are two in the us will be in ohioand in californiain terms of europe as soon as we openthat u.s office that means thateveryone here in headquarters can focusin 100 on the european propositionfinally where i think ga really willhelp us as well is in our apac expansionso we're currently looking into that howthat looks so that's a project thatwe're currently working on as well whichi'm absolutely buzzing about sothere it is that's everything that'sgone on gymshark in the last few monthsit's beenpossibly the most difficult experienceof my entire

super superconfident in i often like use the wordsjiggle proofthey hold you in so when you're doingsome of those crazy moves that i makeyou do they're like they're theredo you know what i mean like they'rereally holding you in place and they aresoflattering on the butt honestly if youare gonna snaganything from this sale please be readyfor the ombre because i justlove them this is the crop that it comeswith i'm just gonna do a little u-turnwith thisyou have that scrunch at the back whichagain is just soflattering it adds like a little bitcute a little bit sexy but also sportyat the same time another thing that ilove about these and you can see it moresowhat i'm wearing right here they coveryou but they also have just likea little bit of skin on show so againit's likesexy sporty shows a bit of skinnot too much skin i love the ombre somuch so just take a little note of thatombretick secure the camo seamless guys ijust found out that this is50 freaking percent off this is one ofmy absolutefavorites for those of you who follow myworkouts you'll know that i wear thisprobably once a week and alex getsreally annoyed with me because he's likelil you have so many outfits will youplease mix it up this is a go-to this isa staple i can relyon this baby it's just so flattering itholds you in place it is socardio proof and it's also a little bitsexy the back of itis so freaking cute the front of it islike a little bit of cleavage not toomuch cleavage i love it so much can youtell50 off likeand you also have the obsidian green sothis is the black 50off the obsidian green leggings are 20off so guys these are absolute steel theaqua green isalso in the sail which again you wouldhave seen on me so many times and i'mgoing to show you the back of thisbecause it is so freaking cutelook at that i just love itthe top has like this little scrunch bitat the front which is just so flatteringso thisis 30 off and these babiesare 50 off let's go a little bit deeperthe reason why iabsolutely love these babies is becausethey have that thick waistband again sothey're pulling into the waistthey're helping to create that illusionof the hourglass shapeand their cardio proof i don't know whatit isabout this material but it like sucksyou inand holds you in place but it's alsobreathablei can't work it out because it'sbreathableit's movable but it also holds you inplace they're justthey're phenomenal and then the backlook at thisyou have this cute little scratch bar ifyou haven't tried one of the scrunchbums it'sso amazing for shaping into the butt bythe way you guys i wear a size small inall gym shark and it literally fitsperfectly i'd say these are very verytrue to sizeand they're nice and long obviouslythey're super stretchy so depending onhow tall you are i'm pretty tall andthey nearly come down to my ankle whichis like quite unusual for meonto the sports bra i love it i wouldsay this is probably a medium supportit's gotrelatively thick straps which gives youthat nice amount of support howeverit is quite low-cut but those are mygirls who have bigger boobs than meyou're very lucky number one number twoyou might not like this very muchbecause it can getquite like pow in your face if you knowwhat i mean but if you're kind of moremore humble in this area you might likethat little bit of cleavage i think thisgives you like a nice amount of cleavagebut not too much 50 off you guys likei love this bra so much just look at thebackthat is so sexy oh my goshlook at it it's got like the odd littlehole the crossoverit just looks so good on the back and ilove and istrap you back i couldn't think of whati was saying but you know whatever thesebabies have 30 off and i already knowthat you girls wentabsolutely crazy for this when i firstwore it in a youtube video was it likethree months ago maybe longer ilove it i think it's the contrast to behonest like that bright pinkwith the gray and also the waistband thewaistband on the leggingscoupled with the waistband on the croptop is so freakingflattering again it's pulling into thewaist it's like creating that illusionof the hourglass shape let's just popthem there like that like to be honesti would mix match that i think they gotogether i'm hoping you can seethey are silky soft the one thing iwould say about these is you're notgoing to want to do crazy amounts ofcardio in them certainly not my likecardio hit sessions because they arebrutali wear them for pilates i wear them forweights the sports braisn't as supportive in my opinionas the other sports bra that i justshowed you i think it's because it'sjustit's not as tight it's not like ascompressive this for me is likereally really beautiful lounging aroundthe house attempting to look like a cutelittle sports girlor like your lower impact workouts thefitfrom a style point of view is like oneof my absolutefavorites and i know you guys love ittoo because i just got so many messageswhen i wore it last time i'm inabsolute shock the new high-waistedflecksare in the sale these for me they werelike a game changer i think it's thecolorsalso combined with the contour alsocombined with the thick waistband alsocombined with the designi love them and i think you already knowthat because i wear them in so many ofmy videos but all of theseleggings are 20 off this isn't on yourwish listi think you're a little bit crazybecause theythey are phenomenal this actually comesas a set the charcoalruby pink leggings and the strappysports bra this is the only one thatcomes as a set at 20off otherwise it's just the leggings ontheir own i would be ready for thisthis is in my opinion one of the mostsexybeautiful gym shark outfits there arethe gray you already knowis so flattering on the booty iabsolutely love that contouring underthe bum it's likeso so flattering the ruby pink contrastof the writing on the gray i just thinklooks so cute the strappy sports bra isi would say like low to medium supportactually more medium because it comespretty high but obviously the strapsmean that it's not like super supersupportiveit's adjustable and it's got removablepads most of the gym chalk bras do haveremovablepractice pads this is my favorite colorthe navy gray and if you look from thefront you can actually see that it hasthat darker contouringdown the side which creates that shapeinto the hipsthese leggings are one of the mostflattering gym shark leggings you've gotthat really high waist which is kind oflike it's it's quite tight it's not tootight but it really does pull you in i'mwearing a size smallthey're nice and long as well andthey're like super supportivea hundred percent for cardio i would bewearing these so thesefor me are an absolute steal mark itdown and don't miss out i just literallycan't believe they're 20off of these well i got you on flexthese are the flex high-waisted leggingswhich are30 off these are two of my absolutefavorite colorsthe ones that i just showed you were thenew high-waisted flexthese are the flex high-waisted leggingsand this is i think lamered claret sorry guys flavor cooli'm losing it just beautifulness andthis isthe gray black and to be honest reallysimilarjust so flattering the contouring thecolorsi love this you already know i love abright color it's justso cute how many times can a girl saycute in a clothing haulthe last collection i'm showing you isthe vital seamless in my opinion thevital seamless is a classic it's like alittle black dress it's something thatevery girlshould have in their wardrobe i love thesimplicity of iti love that it just fits like a gloveand there's nothing overly complex aboutit there's no like crazy contours theseare just classic so i've picked out someof my favorites there's a sports bra incherry brown and that's 20 off also thesports brain black and then you've got the longsleeve cropwhich is also 20 off in black and theni've got twoof the vital seamless leggings herewhich are in redheat and black what i love about theleggings is that they're compressive butthey're alsobreathable they're stretchy and they'renot overly thick they're nowhere near asthick as like the flexbut they're still compressive they'resuper super flatteringif you're gonna buy just one from thiscollection i'd recommend the black justbecause it goes with absolutelyeverythingand then you can mix and match a littlebit again you've got that super thickwaistband which helps to pull into thehourglass shape into the waistnice and tight i wear a size small andit fits absolutely perfectlythey're full length they got a nicestretch to them they are in my opinionsquat proofand then if you want a nice pop of colorthis actually goesreally really nice with the black i tendto mix and match the matchheat red i personally think it lookslike orange so each time i go to look itup i'm like theheat red looks really really nice withthe black crop what ilove about the crop is that it's reallythinso it's so much more breathable than sayfor example the ombreif you are someone who gets reallypretty sweaty and you want to wear thisthroughout your workout this is way morebreathable it's a lot thinner materialyou've also gotthis cute little thumb section which forsomeone like mei don't wear all the time because i haveexcessively longarms you can actually just fold themback but this one actually fits me andthen the crop topabsolute classic i would saymedium to potentially high support ifind these come up a tiny bitbig actually that's just my opinion soi'd recommend if you're kind of inbetween sizes sizing downyou've got the thick straps again soreally nice and supportive particularlywhen you're doing cardioremovable pads and they're reallycomfortable because it's really reallystretchy around the waistband so it'snot like super compressive where youfeel like you can't breatheyou've got loads and loads of room and ithink that's probably whyi tend to size down and then it's justgot a really nice simple like racerbackon the back on the back of course it'seraser i keep saying last thing and ipromise this is now the last thing butthere's so much more i could show youguys because there's so much in the saleand i really don't want you missing outi couldn't miss this offyou know how much i love this crop topit's called the fraction crop top i'venow completed my collection i've got itin every single colorthis is the powder blue the burgundythere's also thei think it's called the light gray andthe black and the light gray and theblack i wearabsolutely all the time they are so cutethey kind of lift into the waistand like when you lift your arms up itkind of shows a little bit of the waistjust likesuper super flattering and then withthese wide shouldersit like creates that wider shoulder lookwhich then againpulls into that hourglass shape they'rekind of like a little boyfriend t-shirtbut cropped and you can play around withthem a little bit how far you wear themback on your shoulders or more soforward if you want a little bit morewaist or a little bit less waste if youwear them with areally high-waisted pair of leggingsthey're like that little bit of skin youknowand it's like not too much skin but it'slike oh i completely forgot to mention20 off all of the colors put that onyour listokay fam we made it through my firstclothing haul in a year i hope youenjoyed it

so let me get this straight now jimshark doesn't just promoteunrealistic expectations for skinny guysbut they do it for plus size athletes aswellhey what's up guys welcome back to thechannel so today i'm gonna be talkingabout a few recent posts from gymsharknow one of them the majority of youalready know aboutand this post was done last week itfeatured a girl named nelly londonshe's a lingerie model from the unitedkingdom and she posted a photo ofherselfon her page where she was wearing hergym shack clothingand she had the waistband up on onephoto and down on the othershowing that she does not have theperfect body or one that you would thinka lingerie model just might have rightand the postwent viral it exploded and it looks likejim shock basically reached out to herto see if they couldput the photo on their page and this wason like september 7thand the post went crazy i mean it hasover 600 000 likesuh like 23 000 comments i mean peoplejust wentnuts over the photo and a lot of peoplewere basically sayinglike it looks like gymshark is finallygoing to pull awayfrom all these unrealistic body typesthat they've been promoting since dayoneand they might actually be promotingsome normal peoplei mean jim shack's been around for awhile they've been around since 2012they're like 131 countries the businessis worthlike over a billion dollars i meanobviously the companyis successful and a lot of people feelthat the marketing side of thingsweren't really too honest a lot of theathletes that they hadclaimed natural weren't really naturalthat's not what the video is about nowit seems like they've pretty muchcapped the market on the fitness side ofthingsand they want to start branching offinto other directions and one of theonly ways you can do thatis by taking advantage of something likethe body positive movementlet's market our clothing in such a waywhere people who aren't super hugeripped and shreddedor have super tiny waists still feellike they can be a part of the brand andthat brings up the mostrecent post which is this one right hereand as you scroll through the images thefirst two imagesare the only ones that really promotethat body positive message that they'retrying to sendthen as you go through the other imagesthere's some other models therethat look like they work out there's aguy that's in great shape there's a girlthat's relatively skinny maybe she doeszumba i don't knowbut you get the gist of what i'm tryingto say but when you really doa deep dive into both postsyou come out on totally different endsof the spectrumand that's what we're going to talkabout today and i don't really thinka lot of you guys even have a clue aboutanything i'm about to say right nowwhich is why i'm going to dive inbecausei saw the post last week and i saw a lotof people making a videoum about the nelly london post and afterreading a lot of the commentsi decided to wait and the reason why iwaited is becausejim shack responded to a lot of peoplein thosecomments saying things like expect toseemore of this more like this is coming weplan on doing more like this like thingsalongthose lines and so in my head i saidokay welli want to wait to see how long it takesbefore we start to see more like thisand lo and behold a week later we havethis post so we're going to dissect thetwobut real quick before we jump in i justwant tosay something about the nelly londonpost i wanted to read a couple commentsfrom here becausei did like the things that i saw i meanthese comments are from real peopleand based on how many likes the commentshasthere's a lot of people that feel thesame way this is important sowe got this post from pedro if you getmad at this postthink of it this way gym shock isbasically sayingyou don't have to look a certain way togo to the gymeveryone starts from somewhere and ithink that's what everyone is missingfromthis over 14 000 likeson this post and what's so incredible tome about that post isthis is something that i think needs tobe preached more ofteni've had several clients that were a bitoverweight that didn't want to go to thegym they wanted to train at home becausei thought as soon as they stepped in thegymthey were going to be ridiculed andstared at for not lookingas in shape as everybody else when infact it's the opposite because guys likeme who've been in the gym my entire lifei've seen all kinds of people comethrough the door and i know what it'sliketo start out maybe not on the heavy sideof things but i was super skinny when ifirst started and i felt intimidatedbut what i noticed is that as i walkedthrough the door and i started workinghardthe other people in the gym the veteranswe'll call them they always wanted toshow me stuff and they always wanted toteach me stuff because as soon as youwalk through that doorwhether you're overweight or skinnyyou've already made a conscious decisionto change your body and everyone in thegym seesthat when you walk through the door andthat's why people like me will come upto you if you're new in the gym andoffer to help younot just because of a personal trainernot just because i have a youtubechannelbecause we see the effort and we want toembrace itand help you and let's read a few moreposts we have one fromthis woman meek zazone ithink how you say her name coming fromsomeone who used to look at yourclothing and know that i didn't looklike any of the athletes you had on yourinstagram and websitethis means a lot representation mattersthank you 14 000 likesuh maddie boom bla blatti i'm here forthis kind of content we need more ofthisso it goes on and on you see all thesesupportive comments which i think isgreat and if we take a look at nelly shehas areally inspirational story i'm going topost a link for you guys isuggest you go over and read it to learnmore about her but basicallyshe grew up and she hated her body shehated itand she talks about how she had multipleeating disordersshe says from as young as i can rememberi hated my bodyand at my worst stage of disorderedeating i was suffering fromthree eating disorders anorexia bulimiaand binge eatingand she was also periodically abusinglaxativessomething that has unfortunately causedpermanent damage to her digestive systemand she also talks about how for yearsshe couldn't get the help she neededbecause doctors told her that she waswithin the correct amount of weightfor her height and her age and it wasn'tuntil she really opened up to herparentsthat they took her to see a eatingdisorder specialist where she finallygot the help she needed then she talksabout howwhen she was in her teens she neverthought she'd be a lingerie model todayi mean her storyis incredible and this is the kind ofthing that i thinkjim shock should promote and she is thekind of person that i thinkthey should bring on as an athlete fortheir marketing campaignsbecause she's relatable and she has anamazing storyand she doesn't have that perfect lookthat jim shaq usually posts i mean ifyou look at her photosshe looks great but she clearly did somedamage to her body and she's holdingbody fat in certain areas she hasstretch marksbut she embraces all of that and nellyif you're watching this video i mean myhat goes out to youyou're inspirational to anyone whetheryou're a girl or a guy in shape out ofshapeit's an inspirational story and it'samazing but the difference betweenher post and the most recent one by jimshock is thather post is something that they probablyasked her if they could put on theirpage they even took her caption that shewrote on her original post on herprofileand they reposted it now if you look atthe mostrecent post they did this is more of amarketing campaign this was doneinternally by jim shock with modelsthat they hired well i guess nellie's amodel too but you understand what i'msaying these are people they flew inand they did a photo shoot because theywere launching some new clothing andthey wanted to get the marketingcampaign donenow if we scroll through the first twopeoplethey look like some people who you wouldthink were you knowaverage people who worked out that'skind of the messaging they're trying tosendthese are your everyday average peoplewho work out and still wear our clothingthen i just scroll through some moreyou've got some other guys and someother girls thatyou know they're they're they'redefinitely not average they look likethey work out but they're notsuper ripped either like unrealisticthey're allobtainable body types which is greatmessagingif we take a look at the post itselfthey actually tag all of the models thatthey had in the campaign and so ithought to myselfthe first two people are supposed to bethe relatable guy and the relatable girlsoi wanted to click on their social mediahandles and see what they diddo they take fitness seriously do theygo to the gym do they post workoutfootagewhy were they picked to be a part ofthis campaign that's supposed to bepolitically correct or bring about morebrand awareness to people that maybearen't necessarily trying to getultra huge and ripped but just enjoycasually going to the gym andmaintaining their health and sothe first person his name is benny itook a look at his profile page oninstagram at the very top it says thathe's a big and tall modeli don't think he models that muchbecause he doesn't have too many postson his page and if you scroll down tothe bottomit looks like one of his original postsis from a gym shock photo shoot that hedid in 2019and if you compare that photo to thephoto nownot to be mean but it doesn't look likehe got much talabut he certainly got a little biggerwhich raises the questionwhy are you reaching out to people to bein a campaignfor a gym shack which is a fitness brandif they don't take their fitnessseriously because that's stillnot relatable maybe not they're nottrying to go after people that aretrying to get huge and ripped in the gymbut they're still trying to be relatableto people who still work out and try toeat consistently to be healthy i mean atthe end of the day if you start at pointaand you're trying to get to point b evenif you don't have the best diet or thebest workout programif you are consistent you should seesome level of gains you will start tosee a little bit of weight loss you willstart to seea little bit of toneage in the arms andthe legs and that's not happening heresofail number one number two is this girlsunny she was a bit more difficult todecipherand it's tricky because she's a plussize model now i don't know how much youguys know about the modeling industry iused to model back in the day full of alot of shady peopleand they really want you to look aspecific way and according to sunnyin a interview that she gave back inmarch of 2019 you guys can google iti'll post the link down belowshe even talks about how even thoughshe's a plus sizemodel there is still a specific lookthat youneed to have to be successful and thatlookis the hour glass look big ontop big on the bottom skinny in themiddleand she also goes on to talk about howwhen she first started modeling shewasn't quite plus size and she wasn'tquite regular sizeand so she was having a hard timefitting in she said that they actuallyput some specialpadding on her to make her look morelike that plus size look they want tohave and sowhenever we hear plus size modeling topeople who don't really dive into it toomuch we associate that with bodypositivity and body acceptance when inrealitythey don't even have body positivity andbody acceptance within their own spacein their own plus size modeling industryif you want to be competitive you haveto look likethis is what they tell you just like ifyou want to be a runway model if youwant to be competitive in runway youhave to look like thisso both sides of the spectrum areterrible it's a terrible industry it'swhy i don't do it anymore i did it forlike a yearand that was it so then i started kindof scrolling through her photos and ifound myself at the very bottom of herpage when she was about 18 years old andshe was actually quite thinand then as time progressed she startedgaining weight she started having somebody problemsi saw a video on her youtube channel shetalked about you know going through bodydysmorphia and things like thatum and then her body started doing thisweird transformation where it's likethroughout 2018she started packing on body fat and shewas holding a lot of it in her torsoarea and she still kind of had a buttonthighs but if you compare her photosfrom 2018to her photos now it's like her body didthis weirdhourglass transformation and i'm sittinghere wondering how the hell did thishappenbecause i know you can't spot reduce fatand i also know you can't spotgain fat and i also know in the plussize modeling industry these womenwill do crazy things to their bodies inorder to stay competitiveif you do a simple google search some ofthe things that they do is they try todo umthis injection in their neck in order toreduce the fat there to get rid of thedouble chinbut still remain plus size a lot ofthese women will get liposuction thatway they can have the hourglasslook suck the fat out of the torso toplooks bigbottom looks big and you're good to goand then you can also do things like abrazilian butt lift where if you wantyour button thighs to look biggerthey'll take some of that fat theysucked out and they'll squish it rightback in your butt and thighsnow i'm not saying i know for certainthat she did any of these things i don'tknow at the end of the dayi'm just looking at photos and photoscan be very deceivingbut these ones just to me they look alittle too deceivingand if she's remaining competitive inthe industry starting out here whenshe's 18 and looking like this nowthe transformation it just it doesn'tmake sense to me againi just don't think that this person isrealistic or a relatable personto the average person you're trying toreach out toif you're trying to be a bit morepolitically correct if anythingi think nelly is that person and i saidit in the beginning of the videonellie went through a really traumaticchildhood dealing with her eatingdisordersshe learned how to overcome them andabove everything else she's a lingeriemodel and she'sproud of her body and how she looks andit looks very clear to methat she hasn't done any type of surgeryto try to fix anything she trulyloves herself and that is the ultimatebody positivityand based on just the likes and commentsalone i think they should be reachingout to herin fact they should have seen that postand then realized they had this campaignthey were going to launchthey should have scrapped it hired herpaid her as an athleteand did a campaign

so let me get this straight now jimshark doesn't just promoteunrealistic expectations for skinny guysbut they do it for plus size athletes aswellhey what's up guys welcome back to thechannel so today i'm gonna be talkingabout a few recent posts from gymsharknow one of them the majority of youalready know aboutand this post was done last week itfeatured a girl named nelly londonshe's a lingerie model from the unitedkingdom and she posted a photo ofherselfon her page where she was wearing hergym shack clothingand she had the waistband up on onephoto and down on the othershowing that she does not have theperfect body or one that you would thinka lingerie model just might have rightand the postwent viral it exploded and it looks likejim shock basically reached out to herto see if they couldput the photo on their page and this wason like september 7thand the post went crazy i mean it hasover 600 000 likesuh like 23 000 comments i mean peoplejust wentnuts over the photo and a lot of peoplewere basically sayinglike it looks like gymshark is finallygoing to pull awayfrom all these unrealistic body typesthat they've been promoting since dayoneand they might actually be promotingsome normal peoplei mean jim shack's been around for awhile they've been around since 2012they're like 131 countries the businessis worthlike over a billion dollars i meanobviously the companyis successful and a lot of people feelthat the marketing side of thingsweren't really too honest a lot of theathletes that they hadclaimed natural weren't really naturalthat's not what the video is about nowit seems like they've pretty muchcapped the market on the fitness side ofthingsand they want to start branching offinto other directions and one of theonly ways you can do thatis by taking advantage of something likethe body positive movementlet's market our clothing in such a waywhere people who aren't super hugeripped and shreddedor have super tiny waists still feellike they can be a part of the brand andthat brings up the mostrecent post which is this one right hereand as you scroll through the images thefirst two imagesare the only ones that really promotethat body positive message that they'retrying to sendthen as you go through the other imagesthere's some other models therethat look like they work out there's aguy that's in great shape there's a girlthat's relatively skinny maybe she doeszumba i don't knowbut you get the gist of what i'm tryingto say but when you really doa deep dive into both postsyou come out on totally different endsof the spectrumand that's what we're going to talkabout today and i don't really thinka lot of you guys even have a clue aboutanything i'm about to say right nowwhich is why i'm going to dive inbecausei saw the post last week and i saw a lotof people making a videoum about the nelly london post and afterreading a lot of the commentsi decided to wait and the reason why iwaited is becausejim shack responded to a lot of peoplein thosecomments saying things like expect toseemore of this more like this is coming weplan on doing more like this like thingsalongthose lines and so in my head i saidokay welli want to wait to see how long it takesbefore we start to see more like thisand lo and behold a week later we havethis post so we're going to dissect thetwobut real quick before we jump in i justwant tosay something about the nelly londonpost i wanted to read a couple commentsfrom here becausei did like the things that i saw i meanthese comments are from real peopleand based on how many likes the commentshasthere's a lot of people that feel thesame way this is important sowe got this post from pedro if you getmad at this postthink of it this way gym shock isbasically sayingyou don't have to look a certain way togo to the gymeveryone starts from somewhere and ithink that's what everyone is missingfromthis over 14 000 likeson this post and what's so incredible tome about that post isthis is something that i think needs tobe preached more ofteni've had several clients that were a bitoverweight that didn't want to go to thegym they wanted to train at home becausei thought as soon as they stepped in thegymthey were going to be ridiculed andstared at for not lookingas in shape as everybody else when infact it's the opposite because guys likeme who've been in the gym my entire lifei've seen all kinds of people comethrough the door and i know what it'sliketo start out maybe not on the heavy sideof things but i was super skinny when ifirst started and i felt intimidatedbut what i noticed is that as i walkedthrough the door and i started workinghardthe other people in the gym the veteranswe'll call them they always wanted toshow me stuff and they always wanted toteach me stuff because as soon as youwalk through that doorwhether you're overweight or skinnyyou've already made a conscious decisionto change your body and everyone in thegym seesthat when you walk through the door andthat's why people like me will come upto you if you're new in the gym andoffer to help younot just because of a personal trainernot just because i have a youtubechannelbecause we see the effort and we want toembrace itand help you and let's read a few moreposts we have one fromthis woman meek zazone ithink how you say her name coming fromsomeone who used to look at yourclothing and know that i didn't looklike any of the athletes you had on yourinstagram and websitethis means a lot representation mattersthank you 14 000 likesuh maddie boom bla blatti i'm here forthis kind of content we need more

[Music]hey guys and welcome back to my channelif you are new here my name is Catherineand I talked a lot about leggings likedupes affordable gym wear etc so ifthat's interesting to you go ahead andsubscribe down below so you don't miss avideo I have some good ones coming up bythe way and some dupes for this actuallyso today we're talking about the gymshark high-waisted flex set so this wasa very hyped up thing for Jim sharktheir flex leggings are mighty liketheir most famous leggings like I feellike they're like 10 feel like originalJim shark leggings and they made them ina high-waisted form which is a lot moreflattering because the Flex crew neverthe regular flex forever in my favoriteleggings just because I felt like theywere really like the waistband couldreally give you a little muffin topwhich isn't cuteso these definitely help with that butyeah we're gonna talk about how they fitif they are squat proof because therewas some tea on that honestly so we'regonna explore if these are as sheer assome may have thought and just abouteverything else you need to knowstarting out with the price these are$50 for the leggings and $35 for thesports bra so 35 is like a decent pricefor a sports bra this is kind of likefirst workout this level of structure Iwould I would say it's probably like onthat like upper to middle end so theoriginal flex leggings were 38 dollarsso 50 is definitely a step up from thatand I know that Jim shark has kind ofbeen raising their prices recentlyeveryone you know who Shops at Jim sharkknows about that and also I know thatlike at least for Canadian in Canadiandollars I think these leggings are likedollars I have some people on Instagrammessage me about gym stuff and likethey're like oh this was $90 I havefriends all around the world who aresaying like how expensive these are inother countries so justify the cheapestyou can get them it's probably in the USthe UK and in the US they're 50 USdollars the collection has a sports brain the leggings and it comes in thekhaki color a charcoal Morrow and blackI do have to say I wish that they cameout with the top because they almostalways come out with a top with theircollection it's kind of weird for themjust to come out with the sports brownleggings because some people do like tobe more covered up than just a sportsbra but yeah so in this collectionyou'll only be getting sports groundleggings but you can always wear I guessthey do have like tops from the originalFlex collection then you can pair withthese but they won't be seamless that'swhere the material the leggings are madeout of they're made out of I'm justgonna read it because numbers 56 percentnylon 39 percent polyester and 5%elastane and compared to the originalflex the original flex are 56 percentnylon 41 percent polyester and 5 3percent a lot of stain so basicallythey're almost the exact samecomposition as the original flexleggings except slightly more lastingand how I feel about them is I feel likethey feel really close to the Flexleggings in the material they have thesame marl texture feels like the samethickness but they do feel a little bitmore compressing than the original flexI don't know if that's just studentssizing the original flex ran a little alittle bigthese run creatures true to size /slightly small I wouldn't recommendgoing down a whole size but just knowyou are going to get kind of a snug fitwith your normal size of these leggingsso compared to the original gym sharkflex I would definitely say that theseare these are a little flimsy ER andthere's definitely more structure to thehigh-waisted flex so it's going to offermore compression and also yeah it justfeels it just feels thicker like I thinkthat that look even like you can kind oftell it's pretty close but this thehigh-waisted flex is definitely slightlythicker but they both have the marledtexture andit's very similar so I mean obviously ifyou had to compare to a fabric I wouldcompare it to the Flex their originalflex but you're getting less like Idon't know I had some like bagginess andthese even though they were at the rightsize so you're getting a lot lessbagginess and more compression with thehigh-waisted flex continuing to talkabout sizing this comes in the leggingsand the sports bra both come in extrasmall to large and they fit like I saidbasically true decides if not a teenybit small the waistband is nice andribbed it's a decent height thewaistband definitely offers compressionwhich I love but I definitely think thatthey've upgraded their waist bands fromlike the bio seamless and ombre seamlesswith those waistbands they stretched outlook really easily but with the camoseamless and this flex the waist bandsaren't stretching out they're holdingtheir shape much better which i think isexcellent because who likes evaluatesman you know so it'll hold you in andthe leggings Bullockstay up and just it's just that they'rethe waistband on this is very very goodit's also very thick if you're lookingif you're looking for a waistband heightcomparison it is definitely shorter thanthe vital seamless waistband yeah sodefinitely if you don't like how highthe waistband is in the vital seamlessthe high-waisted flex definitely has ashorter waistband but it also has awaistband it's it's thicker than thevital seamless as you can tell it's athicker material and it's also morestructured and it's not going to stretchout as much so some of the details thewaistband is ribbed as you can tell it'svery thick and compressing and the backyou have this little widow's peakdetailing a little seam bootie contourwith the mesh material and here's thelogo it's slightly raised if you cantell like the little these are slightlyraised and it's all ribbed and flushwith the waistband so I really like thatactually one difference with thehigh-waisted flex is that they don'thave the mesh that comes down to the legwhich can kind of cut off the length ofyour leg honestly so these are theoriginal flex youthat the side mesh paneling comes downand kind of like goes over your calf butit just continues on the side of thehighway suplex so that's going to work -like elongate your legs a bit and it'snot going to cut off your leg line likethe original flex so I definitely likethat feature so now to the leggings Ireally love the waistband as you can seeit hits like right where your waistshould come in it's not too long it'snot it doesn't really look like totallya separate waistband from the leggingsit kind of blends very seamlessly whichI like except for the side hereobviously people were kind of going onabout the Sheerness of these leggings sothis part is a mesh part like you cansee my hand there I don't even know ifyou can see my nail color but like I'mwearing like a light pink underwearmaybe I'll try out like a darker pair tosee if we can see that but in terms ofsquad crudeness and it's like taupe it'svery sloppy[Music]like I did the test I checked I'm a ringlight in front of you it's squat proofso I know that that that looks like itcontroversy for some people I don't knowabout the other shades I know the blackspecifically it was not supposed to besquat proof but the khaki is it isactually squat proof even though theseare tiny bit tight the waistband itfeels a lot like the camo so you mustwaistband so I doesn't feel like it'sgoing to stretch out it feels like it'sgoing to hold its shape very well whichis important to me cuz a lot of germshark things start out very easily umyeah the booty contours they didn't needa pretty good place this hits slightlybelow my butt so it's just like acentimeter higher there'll be better butmaybe find a bigger butt that whathappened and has this little peakdetailing of course the logo itdefinitely feels like there's sometightness in the crotch sometimes doshark sometimes do sharp like seamsaren't the most flexible seems like ifthey could use like a like stretchy orstringing that would probably be nicebut I definitely do have that tightnessin the crotch actually think I alreadysee there's already a little like oh doyou see this there's already a littlestring coming off so I don't I don't Idon't love that I think I've done abetter job there but that's all honestlythe same as that regular original flexin terms of length the original flexwere too long on me and I'm five ninedis measurements in the descriptionbelow and these fit like just perfectlylike they go right to make oh they'refull length not seven eighths ifanything there's actually a teeny bit ofextra room there's like a lot more roomfor me on the regular flex so I talkedabout squat goodness for me these weredefinitely squawk roof I can't speak tothe other colors but I know that theblack had some controversy but I meanthis is the lightest color and thesewere squat proof so that's pretty good Idid get a- cameltoe you can kind of tell from thetry on it was like cringing a little bitwatching it but it's not awful becauseit doesn't have a front seam so it's notlike you know it's not doing the totaldouble candle dividing it you know whatI'm sayingbut there's definitely a little cameltoe just because of how seamless thefabric is I feel like but I kind of geta teeny bit of control and all of Jimshark stuff and you just kind of learnto live with it so I think thateveryone's kind of over the you knowclickbait camel toe Jim shark videoslike we expect a little bit at thispoint yeah and as I was saying in thetry on the the seams here they just feelvery stiff and I definitely felt this inthe original flex as well part of thereason why I don't love the flex and Ihaven't even like this is before workingout in them guys and do you see there'salready like a little bit of where to gothere's already like a little piece oflike the string coming off and I tend tolike if your thighs touch at all whichlike I do this like string will rubtogether and it'll kind of fray let meshow you my regular flex yeah you cantell them the regular flex that theseams have kind of just like they're alittle bit a little bit stringy you knowthey're they've gotten a littlefuzziness kind of they're just rubbingtogether so much these aren't the kindof leggings that I would like I guessI'm a dancer these aren't the kind ofleggings I would dance in because I knowthat it's very restricting to try tostretch in like in the fabric like thisif I'm trying to do the splits I reallycan't because the crotch just won'treally give me that room that I need butif you're just like going to the gymworking out not doing any crazystretching which you probably shouldstretch so I don't know I'm just sayingnot the most room in crotch but overallI would give these leggings I think thatJim shark is definitely improving theirquality but I still give these leggingslike an 8 out of 10 just because thereare some things wrong with them Idefinitely prefer the camo seamless theywere just those leggings I really didn'thave any complaints really didn't forthe sports bra that it's the samematerial as the leggings adjustablestraps cute bag detailing and as someonewho haschess this is a medium support I'm verysurprised very full coverage no spillingor anything I definitely was very blownaway by the sports bra I really thoughtI didn't like it but the fabric is justso it's so compressing in the top andlike it just it actually does providesome support which is pretty good forjuncture sports for us usually there'sreally no support going on I did takeout there moveable paths though becauseyou could like see their little circlesthat's not cute thank youokay so first things first you can seethe little pads don't really have a nicespot so those it is gonna come right outI always take the pads out of doingshark things because they're just so soflimsy like they really didn't thinkvery hard about these pads I wasexpecting like absolutely zero supportgiven how open this back is and thespaghetti straps and just like just abusiness it's actually like you can tellthere's not too much jiggling going onwhich is like actually pretty good likeI totally thought this sportswear I wasgoing to be like nothing for me but Iactually would give this a mediumsupport which I've ranted about gymtrack sports gross before so that's abig that's a big move um so obviouslythis is the khaki color these twomaterials are different but this is it'slike the material that's like a mesh onthe Viking but it's a double layer soit's thicker um I know a lot of peoplelike this tiny logo but I just kind oflike it's like the back is like Jewishare the pros like ginger you know very Idon't know but I'm really noticeable Ithink it'd be cuter if they just put oneof the little sharks I kind of like thelittle sharks and but I think that theycould or just done without this I justthink it's kind of nothing a lot ofpeople also don't like the big letteringon the back but I do like it I so firstof all this isn't like a blush shade andI think it goes really nicely with thecolor with the khaki color but yeah alot of people don't really likeI see what they were trying to do let megrab the original plugs what's theoriginal flex they're so branded likethat's the big thing about theseleggings is how grand as they are Ithink oh well than that in the boutiqueon turn so I think they were trying torecreate that branding in like aseamless way and I think that this is ano this it's a better a better way to doit if you ask me I think it's reallycute it's in the back it goes the topand bottom go together I know I'm a fanI'm a fan of the branding for sure thetops the straps are also adjustable onthe top which is nice if you don't wantto go up its high you could do that butalso this is like a like full-coveragesports bra I'm not spilling out of thesidesit's covering me completely on the topso and I've got the band on the bottomso I'm actually really happy with thetop so faryeah the sports bra I would also givethis board four one nine out of ten ifyou're looking for a medium supportsports bra I do think it's really cuteand I like the back a lot but the ninebecause I don't like the little germshark logo I just think it's kind ofpointless I can't really even see itnot my favorite so yeah I hope you guysenjoyed this video I hope it was helpfulif you're interested in getting the FlexI do have to flex I wasted flex

let's be real I feel pretty cheap likethis the production quality go downactually pretty nice I definitely havemixed feelings about them they actuallyhaving fun a stretch to them we so likethese are definitely gonna besee-through hey guys and welcome back tomy channelit has not only been while since Ifilmed a video because I just finishedwith finals but it's been a long timesince I filmed one of my really honestgym shark reviews like literally soundslike the Geo seamless in the fall I havenot filmed a brutally honest gym shockreview so that's what we're doing todayand now we're not trying out the camowe're not trying out I knew they'resuper popular stuff I'm trying out someof their kind of underhyped collectionscollections that might seem like theycould be good but I feel like I haven'tseen their athletes really promotingthese a whole lot I have some of thetraining collection I have theseilluminations seamless leggings whichlook kind of interesting I have thetraining leggings which I think aboutthe training leggings is Jim Kirk hasgotten a lot of external people topromote the training leggings likenon-actual Jim shark athletes but thenthere's Jim shark athletes themselvesdon't wear the training leggings so likeWhitney Simmons not once seen her in thetraining leggings so that's kind ofinteresting so I'll be interested to seehow they are they're also $30 which is awhole nother question of mine howthey're able to do that and lastly thesestudio leggings which I've alwaysthought were pretty cute but I feel likeI've heard some mixed things about theseso we're gonna get down to it and see ifany of these are worth it before wecontinue on please make sure to thumbsup and subscribe for more honest reviewskind of what I do in this channel andalthough I've been slow in the gym sharkreviews they're honestly so fun to do soI'm gonna do some more in the futureincluding their new like kind of likeadapt seamless or animal seamlesswhatever they call it I'm gonna be doinga review on that soon so pleasesubscribe and thumbs up so first thing Ihave the training leggings in thetraining 7/8 leggings and I'm actuallygonna measure the inseam for you guysbecause I feel like I see people wearingthese 7/8 leggings and they look likecapris and I don't know how long theactual like full-length leggings are sowhat we're gonna do that we're gonna seeI am pretty tall measurements in thedescription below so we'll see ifthey're full-length on me but these havegotten quite a bit of hype because theyare $30 which normal Jim sharp leggingsare usually 50 to $60 so we're gonna seeif these are really worth it it kind ofmakes me question why these are cheaperlike I don't know how Jim sharp justdecides that some of their leggings aregonna be 60 and so I'm gonna be 30 likedoes the productquality go down and if the productionquality doesn't go down and then arethere other leggings overpriced like letme know what you guys think in thecomments below because I'm a littleconfused on this but my firstimpressions are that they're actuallysuper super soft I have the WhitneySimmons leggings here because I know alot of you guys have been comparingthese fabrics and they do actually feelpretty similar I have washed my whitneysimmons leggings a few times i thinkthey've lost a little bit of their brushmiss so the training leggings actuallyfeel a little bit softer than thewhitney onesokay the lighter blue is the trainingleggings and the darker more bright blueis the Whitney Simmons leggings so youcan see they're both very thin fabricsand slightly brushed and they're bothactually very very soft you might haverisk for some pilling or some lintcollection in these just kind of thenature of a brushed fabric so these aremeant to be a high rise legging they dohave a little press-on logo right here Idon't love these kinds of logos becauseI kind of peel off they do have a seamat the top of the waistband but itdoesn't look horrible like we'll see ifit cuts in they are seamless in thefront which I personally always lovesomething that seamless on the friendthat reminds me of the Whitney Simmonsleggings again also my favorite newpoachin rhythm leggings so no camel toehere they have a slightly extendedgusset crotch they have another gymshark logo in the back here again thepress-on logo and the seams kind ofcurve around the booties so I will beinterested to see how these are so farthey actually feel okay and the greenones I have in these are d 7/8 lengththese 7/8 leggings or a 22 inch in sayin which I feel like is a normal lengthor a cropped legging not a 7/8 a normal7/8 and like a Lululemon is actually 25inches so which now makes sense becausethis is the full-length legging and theyare only about 25 26 inches which is anormal length for a 7/8 legging so Idon't know how they got thesemeasurements but alright so here are thetraining leggings first of all these arethe full length training leggings andthey're like literally shorter than someseven-eighths leggings on me so I meanthat's if you care about them beingfull-length or not but I do I definitelyhave mixed feelings about them there'ssome things I like and there's somethings I don't so I did feel like theywere a little bit tight to get on mythighs and I don't feel like the waistband is offering me much compression atall and I feel like this is definitelygonna saw it down I'm just likealready walking around the apartmenthaving to kind of pull these up to whereI want them the band at the top of thewaist isn't cutting into me at all thisthat's not an issue and I woulddefinitely say they are high-rise theydo go up right to my bellybuttonno camel because there's no front seamso I definitely appreciate that theydefinitely do feel like the WhitneySimmons liking so if you are in lovewith the witness of its fabric Idefinitely feel like these are similarbut I personally felt like the WhitneySimmons leggings the waist beyond was alittle more flattering they actuallystayed up really well on me because Ihad like a pretty tight the end at thetop this one I'm just not feeling likedoing the same fabric is very thin Iwould say light to medium compressionwaistband light compression the back isactually not bad on the booty I don'tfeel like I could pull these up my buttvery much but I would say a solid mediummaybe medium to high on the booty scalethey do have the curved seams that aregoing over my butt so it's not anythingtoo bad going on hereI wouldn't expect these to have a lot ofcellulite coverage because they are verylight and not compressive they're supersuper thin like very very thin leggingsgood for summer I guess these are trueto size I would definitely stick withyour normal size I'm wearing size smallthat's basically what I always get andbesides the fact that the legs are teenybit tight in the waist means a littlebit loose I think sizing down I wouldhave had an issue with getting them onmy legs and potentially with a SheernessI'm not sure how these are gonna be withthe squad test also our little kitten ismeowing across that door and peach ischecking them out yeah I don't thinkthey're gonna be totally sweat proof sofor $30 I think they're okaythe falling down is bothering me alittle bit I personally think that ifyou're gonna go for a legging like thiswith no front seem kind of like butterysoft I'd go for the de poche of rhythmleggings instead because they still arecheaper these aren't bad like I wouldn'tsay I don't recommend them but they'rejust okay for me still okay so these arethe 7/8 length and these are a croppedlegging they're also like really cuttinginto my calves so definitely not a fanbut the fact that they say these are 7/8and they have a Capri as an option theseare definitely not a 7/8 length so Idon't know how they got thereinseam measurements but I got they'reoff[Music]next we have these studio leggings andthese are more of a regular gym shirtprice that are $50these are seamless legging they're not agrass material they're more of a thickknit material kind of like the camo butnot quite as much maybe like in-betweenthe camo and the ombre seamless they dohave a sewn on ribbed waistband and thewhole legging is kind of like a washedlook as you can see the seams are alittle bit darker than the leggings andwhen you stretch the leggings they get abit of a darker look here is thewaistband as you can see it's veryribbed and they do have one of thoselittle seams that separates the booty inthe back which is always nice at theseamless legging so you don't get toomuch Yuna but something that's coolabout these is they do have like kind oflike a floral under booty contour detailwhich is super subtle and I can I reallylike that and these are a full seamlesslegging no seam in the front or back andthey do have a gusset crotch so we willsee you how these are okay so I heardsome negative reviews of these and interms of like Jim shark seamlessleggings these are actually pretty niceI like that they have the logo like sewninto the fabric kind of in a differentlike shade I feel like they're prettythick they have a solid mediumcompression the waistband also has amedium compression these feel likethey're gonna stay up a little betterthan the last ones and they've no seeyou at the top of the waistband oranything there's a tiny bit of gatheringhere but no actual camel I was able topull them up my butt a little bit sothey're actually pretty decent on thebooty scale I feel like I might havelost some booty mask because I have thatdone hip thrusts really in like a monthsince we're in quarantine but I think Igive them a solid medium to high on thebooty scale maybe just a medium theseams do go above the butt and there isa very slight booty contour and theyhave little line between the booty soshe's not upset these are a little bitthicker so they'll probably have morecellulite coverage than the trainingleggings I'm not sure how I feel aboutthe bottom of these they do have like alittle ribbed detail and they're kind oflike I don't know they have this littleangled cuff thing is this okay for me Ican do without it but I guess it addslike a little bit of a touch and theyare more of a 7/8 length on me as wellprobably not entirely sweat proof eitherbut I would probably expect them to be[ __ ] proof they're pretty thick andwhen I squatted in the mirrorokay this fabric really should becollect any lint or pill a lot so itshould be pretty good for performance Ialso think that these are true to sizeI'm wearing size small and if it's justlike any other gym short size smallso yeah I don't mind these I thinkthey're actually pretty cute next wehave the Pippa training joggers which Ithought it looked super cute they havelike a cute little jogger set was like alittle top and the joggers themselvesthese are also $30 so super affordablealready I'm noticing that the fabric issuper super thin it's also very soft butI could see this kind of fabric likesnagging and pilling very easily so itjust doesn't seem like the most durablefabric it's also just like super superthin like you can see my hand throughall of this and I can kind of see thesunlight through so like these aredefinitely gonna be see-through helloyou can see me hi these are see-throughbut anyway so I guess we'll squat testthese even though I don't normally squattest joggers but you do have adrawstring elastic waistband two frontpockets the little lines in the back dokind of taper into a V this is similarto the balance of political joggers andthen there's no real details all the wayto the bottom you have a little anklecuff okay so here are the joggers Idefinitely would say true to size onthese I got a size small and theydefinitely are a relaxed fit like Itightened up the waistband and there'sstill like some room as you can see sodefinitely true to size maybe even sizedown if you like a tighter jogger thesedefinitely are super super thin like I'dlike don't get these if you're expectingto keep warm with the home or anythingbut I mean they're nice light weightjogger I guess I just don't feel likethis is a durable jogger fabric ifyou've ever had both bunny or alpha Lijoggers these are nowhere near thethickness like they're literallypaper-thin that being said I wouldexpect them to be pretty seen through inthe back so not looking forward to thatthey do have some nice curb scenes onthe booty this that's pretty flatteringthere also above the but they're alsobasically a full length on me they gojust about to my ankles just like mostjoggers do so that's pretty good I thinkthey're comfy not gonna lie I justusually prefer my joggers to be a littlemore I don't know durable I justI feel like these are they did they feelcheap let's be real I feel pretty cheapI just don't think they're my favoritejoggers that Jim sharks made I actuallyhaven't tried a lot of Jim shark joggersbeen and we have the illuminationseamless leggings which are $60 so theseto me they don't really feel like aperformance legging they kind of hadthat towel like feeling like the whatare they called what they call like thepower-down leggings but I'd never reallyloved they do have a thicker seamlesswaistband oh it's kind of cool do alittle like things come apart when yousqueeze them pull them here's a close-upof the fabric it's not very soft so I'llbe interested to see I feel like thiswill be kind of itchy but yeah you cancan see they're not rushed or anythingthey're not shiny performance but theydo have a decent amount of stretch theydo have the logo actually sewn into thefabric so I love to see that I love whenwe put in a little more effort into thelogos they do have a standard gussetcrotch here and yeah they're basicallyjust playing all the way down and thenthey have this Jim shark logo at thebottom which is also sewn in so I loveto see it okay so I'm still not sure I'min love with these but they did impressme a lot they actually have a ton ofstretch to them like a lot of stretchand they are really compressive so I dofeel nice and I hold you in a lot Iwould say these are saw a medium to highcompression and they definitely shouldhide cellulite and everything toobecause they not only have texture butthey have a little bit of a pattern so Ido think they'd be fine for that I feellike you can kind of see sometimes agusset crotch like on the front whichI'm not always a fan of it also feelsactually it's decently stretchy in likea squat like this probably cuz it'sdrawn to the fabric I feel like theseseams are definitely a little lessstretchy and I feel like they're verytight and true to size for the most partcos are stretchy but I think there's ateeny bit of room in the waistbandsometimes their waistband like this onethat's similar to the ombre in the vinylseamless tends to stretch out so Iwouldn't be surprised if this onestretched out as well the fabric isn'tas as I thought but it's definitely notlike super super softto say if you're looking for like areally soft legging definitely wouldn'tgo for these the studio leggings weren'tlike super soft either honestly but theyshouldn't tell our collective lint sothat is a bonus of this fabric againthey are not fun when you fund methey're more of a 7/8 so if you like gymshark is just kind of catering to theshort people today they actually do havea slight seam on the booty area so it'sactually pretty flattering on the bootyand I feel like it's really like I don'tknow hugging every area like it'ssqueezing down here kind of coming in inthe middle so I actually think thatthey're pretty nice on the booty andthey just feel good with the compressionno camel going on and also not really alot of crotch gatherings that's good Iwould give them a solid mediumpotentially medium to high on the bootyscale maybe just a medium you're notgonna have to sweat showing in thiscolorI forget what other colors comes in butdark colors you're gonna be a few ofsweat and yeah I would definitely gotrue to size while the waistband itmight stretch out the rest of thelegging is a very snug on me so no Idoubt that I could size down so yeahthese kind of feel like the power-downleggings but definitely a lot morestretch like they definitely have a lotof stretch to them so that's goodthere's a few little notes I had aboutthese but I think that they're betterthan I originally expectedso look is he doneso that is it for this honest room jerkreview I didn't think any of theleggings were like totally taking mybreath away but they were better than Ithought this wouldn't be a video withouta crapper feature of peach so she justwanted to see hi if you like my honestreviews please give this video a thumbsup and subscribe for more let me knowdown in the comments what you

de poche of rhythmleggings instead because they still arecheaper these aren't bad like I wouldn'tsay I don't recommend them but they'rejust okay for me still okay so these arethe 7/8 length and these are a croppedlegging they're also like really cuttinginto my calves so definitely not a fanbut the fact that they say these are 7/8and they have a Capri as an option theseare definitely not a 7/8 length so Idon't know how they got thereinseam measurements but I got they'reoff[Music]next we have these studio leggings andthese are more of a regular gym shirtprice that are $50these are seamless legging they're not agrass material they're more of a thickknit material kind of like the camo butnot quite as much maybe like in-betweenthe camo and the ombre seamless they dohave a sewn on ribbed waistband and thewhole legging is kind of like a washedlook as you can see the seams are alittle bit darker than the leggings andwhen you stretch the leggings they get abit of a darker look here is thewaistband as you can see it's veryribbed and they do have one of thoselittle seams that separates the booty inthe back which is always nice at theseamless legging so you don't get toomuch Yuna but something that's coolabout these is they do have like kind oflike a floral under booty contour detailwhich is super subtle and I can I reallylike that and these are a full seamlesslegging no seam in the front or back andthey do have a gusset crotch so we willsee you how these are okay so I heardsome negative reviews of these and interms of like Jim shark seamlessleggings these are actually pretty niceI like that they have the logo like sewninto the fabric kind of in a differentlike shade I feel like they're prettythick they have a solid mediumcompression the waistband also has amedium compression these feel likethey're gonna stay up a little betterthan the last ones and they've no seeyou at the top of the waistband oranything there's a tiny bit of gatheringhere but no actual camel I was able topull them up my butt a little bit sothey're actually pretty decent on thebooty scale I feel like I might havelost some booty mask because I have thatdone hip thrusts really in like a monthsince we're in quarantine but I think Igive them a solid medium to high on thebooty scale maybe just a medium theseams do go above the butt and there isa very slight booty contour and theyhave little line between the booty soshe's not upset these are a little bitthicker so they'll probably have morecellulite coverage than the trainingleggings I'm not sure how I feel aboutthe bottom of these they do have like alittle ribbed detail and they're kind oflike I don't know they have this littleangled cuff thing is this okay for me Ican do without it but I guess it addslike a little bit of a touch and theyare more of a 7/8 length on me as wellprobably not entirely sweat proof eitherbut I would probably expect them to be[ __ ] proof they're pretty thick andwhen I squatted in the mirrorokay this fabric really should becollect any lint or pill a lot so itshould be pretty good for performance Ialso think that these are true to sizeI'm wearing size small and if it's justlike any other gym short size smallso yeah I don't mind these I thinkthey're actually pretty cute next wehave the Pippa training joggers which Ithought it looked super cute they havelike a cute little jogger set was like alittle top and the joggers themselvesthese are also $30 so super affordablealready I'm noticing that the fabric issuper super thin it's also very soft butI could see this kind of fabric likesnagging and pilling very easily so itjust doesn't seem like the most durablefabric it's also just like super superthin like you can see my hand throughall of this and I can kind of see thesunlight through so like these aredefinitely gonna be see-through helloyou can see me hi these are see-throughbut anyway so I guess we'll squat testthese even though I don't normally squattest joggers but you do have adrawstring elastic waistband two frontpockets the little lines in the back dokind of taper into a V this is similarto the balance of political joggers andthen there's no real details all the wayto the bottom you have a little anklecuff okay so here are the joggers Idefinitely would say true to size onthese I got a size small and theydefinitely are a relaxed fit like Itightened up the waistband and there'sstill like some room as you can see sodefinitely true to size maybe even sizedown if you like a tighter jogger thesedefinitely are super super thin like I'dlike don't get these if you're expectingto keep warm with the home or anythingbut I mean they're nice light weightjogger I guess I just don't feel likethis is a durable jogger fabric ifyou've ever had both bunny or alpha Lijoggers these are nowhere near thethickness like they're literallypaper-thin that being said I wouldexpect them to be pretty seen through inthe back so not looking forward to thatthey do have some nice curb scenes onthe booty this that's pretty flatteringthere also above the but they're alsobasically a full length on me they gojust about to my ankles just like mostjoggers do so that's pretty good I thinkthey're comfy not gonna lie I justusually prefer my joggers to be a littlemore I don't know durable I justI feel like these are they did they feelcheap let's be real I feel pretty cheapI just don't think they're my favoritejoggers that Jim sharks made I actuallyhaven't tried a lot of Jim shark joggersbeen and we have the illuminationseamless leggings which are $60 so theseto me they don't really feel like aperformance legging they kind of hadthat towel like feeling like the whatare they called what they call like thepower-down leggings but I'd never reallyloved they do have a thicker seamlesswaistband oh it's kind of cool do alittle like things come apart when yousqueeze them pull them here's a close-upof the fabric it's not very soft so I'llbe interested to see I feel like thiswill be kind of itchy but yeah you cancan see they're not rushed or anythingthey're not shiny performance but theydo have a decent amount of stretch theydo have the logo actually sewn into thefabric so I love to see that I love whenwe put in a little more effort into thelogos they do have a standard gussetcrotch here and yeah they're basicallyjust playing all the way down and thenthey have this Jim shark logo at thebottom which is also sewn in so I loveto see it okay so I'm still not sure I'min love with these but they did impressme a lot they actually have a ton ofstretch to them like a lot of stretchand they are really compressive so I dofeel nice and I hold you in a lot Iwould say these are saw a medium to highcompression and they definitely shouldhide cellulite and everything toobecause they not only have texture butthey have a little bit of a pattern so Ido think they'd be fine for that I feellike you can kind of see sometimes agusset crotch like on the front whichI'm not always a fan of it also feelsactually it's decently stretchy in likea squat like this probably cuz it'sdrawn to the fabric I feel like theseseams are definitely a little lessstretchy and I feel like they're verytight and true to size for the most partcos are stretchy but I think there's ateeny bit of room in the waistbandsometimes their waistband like this onethat's similar to the ombre in the vinylseamless tends to stretch out so Iwouldn't be surprised if this onestretched out as well the fabric isn'tas as I thought but it's definitely notlike super super softto say if you're looking for like areally soft legging definitely wouldn'tgo for these the studio leggings weren'tlike super soft either honestly but theyshouldn't tell our collective lint sothat is a bonus of this fabric againthey are not fun when you fund methey're more of a 7/8 so if you like gymshark is just kind of catering to theshort people today they actually do havea slight seam on the booty area so it'sactually pretty flattering on the bootyand I feel like it's really like I don'tknow hugging every area like it'ssqueezing down here kind of coming in inthe middle so I actually think thatthey're pretty nice on the booty andthey just feel good with the compressionno camel going on and also not really alot of crotch gatherings that's good Iwould give them a solid mediumpotentially medium to high on the bootyscale maybe just a medium you're notgonna have to sweat showing in thiscolorI forget what other colors comes in butdark colors you're gonna be a few ofsweat and yeah I would definitely gotrue to size while the waistband itmight stretch out the rest of thelegging is a very snug on me so no Idoubt that I could size down so yeahthese kind of feel like the power-downleggings but definitely a lot morestretch like they definitely have a lotof stretch to them so that's goodthere's a few little notes I had aboutthese but I think that they're betterthan I originally expectedso look is he doneso that is it for this honest room jerkreview I didn't think any of theleggings were like totally taking mybreath away but they were better than Ithought this wouldn't be a video

let's be real I feel pretty cheap likethis the production quality go downactually pretty nice I definitely havemixed feelings about them they actuallyhaving fun a stretch to them we so likethese are definitely gonna besee-through hey guys and welcome back tomy channelit has not only been while since Ifilmed a video because I just finishedwith finals but it's been a long timesince I filmed one of my really honestgym shark reviews like literally soundslike the Geo seamless in the fall I havenot filmed a brutally honest gym shockreview so that's what we're doing todayand now we're not trying out the camowe're not trying out I knew they'resuper popular stuff I'm trying out someof their kind of underhyped collectionscollections that might seem like theycould be good but I feel like I haven'tseen their athletes really promotingthese a whole lot I have some of thetraining collection I have theseilluminations seamless leggings whichlook kind of interesting I have thetraining leggings which I think aboutthe training leggings is Jim Kirk hasgotten a lot of external people topromote the training leggings likenon-actual Jim shark athletes but thenthere's Jim shark athletes themselvesdon't wear the training leggings so likeWhitney Simmons not once seen her in thetraining leggings so that's kind ofinteresting so I'll be interested to seehow they are they're also $30 which is awhole nother question of mine howthey're able to do that and lastly thesestudio leggings which I've alwaysthought were pretty cute but I feel likeI've heard some mixed things about theseso we're gonna get down to it and see ifany of these are worth it before wecontinue on please make sure to thumbsup and subscribe for more honest reviewskind of what I do in this channel andalthough I've been slow in the gym sharkreviews they're honestly so fun to do soI'm gonna do some more in the futureincluding their new like kind of likeadapt seamless or animal seamlesswhatever they call it I'm gonna be doinga review on that soon so pleasesubscribe and thumbs up so first thing Ihave the training leggings in thetraining 7/8 leggings and I'm actuallygonna measure the inseam for you guysbecause I feel like I see people wearingthese 7/8 leggings and they look likecapris and I don't know how long theactual like full-length leggings are sowhat we're gonna do that we're gonna seeI am pretty tall measurements in thedescription below so we'll see ifthey're full-length on me but these havegotten quite a bit of hype because theyare $30 which normal Jim sharp leggingsare usually 50 to $60 so we're gonna seeif these are really worth it it kind ofmakes me question why these are cheaperlike I don't know how Jim sharp justdecides that some of their leggings aregonna be 60 and so I'm gonna be 30 likedoes the productquality go down and if the productionquality doesn't go down and then arethere other leggings overpriced like letme know what you guys think in thecomments below because I'm a littleconfused on this but my firstimpressions are that they're actuallysuper super soft I have the WhitneySimmons leggings here because I know alot of you guys have been comparingthese fabrics and they do actually feelpretty similar I have washed my whitneysimmons leggings a few times i thinkthey've lost a little bit of their brushmiss so the training leggings actuallyfeel a little bit softer than thewhitney onesokay the lighter blue is the trainingleggings and the darker more bright blueis the Whitney Simmons leggings so youcan see they're both very thin fabricsand slightly brushed and they're bothactually very very soft you might haverisk for some pilling or some lintcollection in these just kind of thenature of a brushed fabric so these aremeant to be a high rise legging they dohave a little press-on logo right here Idon't love these kinds of logos becauseI kind of peel off they do have a seamat the top of the waistband but itdoesn't look horrible like we'll see ifit cuts in they are seamless in thefront which I personally always lovesomething that seamless on the friendthat reminds me of the Whitney Simmonsleggings again also my favorite newpoachin rhythm leggings so no camel toehere they have a slightly extendedgusset crotch they have another gymshark logo in the back here again thepress-on logo and the seams kind ofcurve around the booties so I will beinterested to see how these are so farthey actually feel okay and the greenones I have in these are d 7/8 lengththese 7/8 leggings or a 22 inch in sayin which I feel like is a normal lengthor a cropped legging not a 7/8 a normal7/8 and like a Lululemon is actually 25inches so which now makes sense becausethis is the full-length legging and theyare only about 25 26 inches which is anormal length for a 7/8 legging so Idon't know how they got thesemeasurements but alright so here are thetraining leggings first of all these arethe full length training leggings andthey're like literally shorter than someseven-eighths leggings on me so I meanthat's if you care about them beingfull-length or not but I do I definitelyhave mixed feelings about them there'ssome things I like and there's somethings I don't so I did feel like theywere a little bit tight to get on mythighs and I don't feel like the waistband is offering me much compression atall and I feel like this is definitelygonna saw it down I'm just likealready walking around the apartmenthaving to kind of pull these up to whereI want them the band at the top of thewaist isn't cutting into me at all thisthat's not an issue and I woulddefinitely say they are high-rise theydo go up right to my bellybuttonno camel because there's no front seamso I definitely appreciate that theydefinitely do feel like the WhitneySimmons liking so if you are in lovewith the witness of its fabric Idefinitely feel like these are similarbut I personally felt like the WhitneySimmons leggings the waist beyond was alittle more flattering they actuallystayed up really well on me because Ihad like a pretty tight the end at thetop this one I'm just not feeling likedoing the same fabric is very thin Iwould say light to medium compressionwaistband light compression the back isactually not bad on the booty I don'tfeel like I could pull these up my buttvery much but I would say a solid mediummaybe medium to high on the booty scalethey do have the curved seams that aregoing over my butt so it's not anythingtoo bad going on hereI wouldn't expect these to have a lot ofcellulite coverage because they are verylight and not compressive they're supersuper thin like very very thin leggingsgood for summer I guess these are trueto size I would definitely stick withyour normal size I'm wearing size smallthat's basically what I always get andbesides the fact that the legs are teenybit tight in the waist means a littlebit loose I think sizing down I wouldhave had an issue with getting them onmy legs and potentially with a SheernessI'm not sure how these are gonna be withthe squad test also our little kitten ismeowing across that door and peach ischecking them out yeah I don't thinkthey're gonna be totally sweat proof sofor $30 I think they're okaythe falling down is bothering me alittle bit I personally think that ifyou're gonna go for a legging like thiswith no front seem kind of like butterysoft I'd go for the

hey guys it's Sierra welcome back to mychannel today we are gonna be doing abrutally honest review of Jim shark butsince this is Jim where I'm gonna add alittle bit of a twist from my normalreviews I'm gonna wear each of theseoutfits to work out in this week to letyou guys know how it actually holds upwhen you're moving and sweating anddoing all the things if you're new to mychannel make sure to subscribe join thefamily I post new videos every Tuesdayand Friday all about like fashionreviews everything in that realm nowlet's get in to this Jim shark review soI have been getting a ton of requests toreview Jim shark because their clothesare super popular but pretty mucheveryone who promotes their clothes iskind of like the same size in the samebody type so I'm obviously going to begiving a different perspective adifferent opinion a different body typeso on Jim sharks website based on mymeasurements it says I would be a sizeextra-largeso that's what I'm gonna be orderingeverything in so outfit number one is amatching set we have the asymmetricalleggings in dusty pink and dark Rubythese are fifty dollars and I orderedthem in an extra large and then thematching asymmetrical vest in the samecolors it is $30 and I also got this inan extra large these are the leggingsquality feels really nice feels reallystretchy and comfortable and then hereis the matching top also feels reallynice my first impressions are prettypositive but let's see how it actuallylooks on[Music][Applause]Jim shark dududud it to hear Jim sharkdue to this today I hate myself okayokay so this might be like the cutestgoogle workout set I've ever like seenor worn I mean we'll talk more about thedesign later but I just feel like thislooks really really cute together so interms of fit I'm definitely glad Ilooked at the sizing chart and size upfor the extra-large because it fits melike perfectly these likings don't haveas much stretch to them as otherleggings I've worn from like fableticsor Lululemon they are a little bit morestructured so you definitely have to becareful that you don't go too small onthe sizing the top especially I think Ireally really like I think the cut issuper flattering and the material is solightweight this would be so comfortableto workout in but we'll see about thatlater in the week and the leggings alsofit really nicely they're high-waistedyou can see they hit like above my bellybutton and have that little crossover sofor my first impression I would givethis up honestly like a nine and a halfout of ten it is really nice but we'llhave to see how my rating holds up whenI wear this for a workout[Music]okay in my car just finished my workoutlet's talk about how this gem sharkoutfit held up during my workout solet's start with a big positive Iabsolutely love this top this isdefinitely gonna be one of my go-toworkout tops from here on out it's verylightweight it's just cropped enoughthat I have plenty of movement but itisn't like showing my stomach oranything like that at the top barelyshowed any sweat but as you can see inthis clip the leggings I mean it's it'sreally just the light color I think anybrand of leggings in this light of acolor is gonna show sweat and this mightbe TMI but you know what this is anin-depth review but we gotta talk aboutit you could see all the butt sweat allthe thigh sweat all the tummy sweat likeI sweat a lot when I workout I reallylike to push myself hard and uh yeah youcould see all of those little sweatmarks which I wasn't the biggest fan ofbut like I said I think that's just thecolor more thin the material the qualityof these leggings definitely holds upfrom my first impression they are squatproof you could not see my underwear atall two things I didn't like about theseleggings though and I am very picky onlegging so keep in mind the overallthese are good leggings these are justthings that bothered me these pants hitreally high which I usually like but thewaistband part of the pants that's meantto kind of like hold everything in isreally small it's not that high so Ifelt like my stomach was not as likeheld together as I usually like it tofeel when I'm working out and movingaround also the pocket location was alittle bit weird on these leggings Ilove that they have pockets because Ilike to just put my phone in there whenI'm working out but in the two otherbrands of leggings that I wear myfabletics ones and my Lululemon ones thepocket is like further down on the thighwhereas this one was up on my hip whichmade it a little bit more difficult tomove around so after my workout I wouldgive this set a seven and a half out often I think this is a really goodworkout set there were definitely somepros and cons the top on its ownhonestly is like a 10 out of 10 I loveit the leggings had some issues butoverall I think it's a pretty good setso I really wanted to do like a varietyof items from gym shark so I kind of getthe full picture so I was looking for apair of shorts so I wanted to go for apair of those really keylike looser-fitting gym shorts that tapeher up at the sides but literally everysingle one of them was sold out so eventhough the sizing chart said I was anextra-large I decided to just order onepair like that in a large just to seebecause they did look more loose-fittingand then I also ordered a pair of themore straight cut boy shirts that aren'tas much my style but did come in anextra-large so first we have the heatherdual band shorts these are the ones thatI got in a large they are $35 and theyare in the color black marl and then inthe extra large I got the archigh-waisted shorts in black and theseare $30 and then I wanted to get asports bra to wear with this outfit butalso to wear with the other outfits thatdidn't come with a sports bra like thefirst one so I ordered the embody sportsbra in dark Ruby and this is in anextra-largeit is $35 which I feel like is prettyfair for a sports bra I have paid a lotof money for a good sports bra because Ineed some support during my workout okso here we have the sports bra andshorts these are not a set these areseparate so let's start with the sportsbra because I really like this it's hardto know when I'm just standing here likeI'm not jumping up and down I'm notrunning I'm not doing jumping jacksI don't know how everything's gonna likestay in place when I'm actually movingbut for right now for just like standingand posing it is really reallycomfortable it also has adjustablestraps on the side which I feel like alot of sports bras don't have and I wasable to actually make it fit me well andit's also longer usually I don't likejust wearing like a sports bra andbottoms I like to have some sort of topbut I feel like this is long enough thatit's almost just like a crop top sosports bra for my first impression I'veI'm gonna give this like a 9 out of 10we'll see how it holds up in the workoutbut let's talk about these shorts cuzI'm not as fond of the shortsinterestingly enough they actually fitme pretty well the shorts legs are superloose so that's on the issue and mythighs are usually the problem with fitand the waistband is really high-qualitylike it's super thick which I feel likewould be comfortable if it was the rightsize but because it's a little bit smallit does feel like a little bit too tighton me and I feel like I youlove when shorts taper up on the sidescuz it's really flattering but theytaper up so much I feel like I'm wearinglike a sumo diaper like say you knowwhat I mean like it's just it goes up sohigh for my first impression I wouldgive these shorts six out of ten and youdo have to keep in mind that these arenot in my proper size so that rating isa little bit skewed but it's my personalrating let's try on the black shorts[Music][Applause][Music]to fit on these black shorts in theactual large is much better like thewaistband is still really thick andhigh-quality but it's not like squeezingme at all and the legs are like longenough and loose enough but I justpersonally like for my tasteI feel like these shorts aren't superflattering or supervise style they kindof remind me of like boxing shortsespecially being in like just a sportsbar on these like I feel like I'm readyto like bite someone so I don't know anyshorts feel really nice like they havethe little zip pockets which I feel likeis super nice for working out becauseyou can just like throw your phone inhere or your keys I do like that they'rehigh-waisted though especially pairingwith a sports bra I feel like I'm notshowing too much skin I would becomfortable working out in this thematerial is super thick though like theyfeel like sweatpants like pajama pants Idon't know how great that would be forlike working out and staying not crazyoverheated Oh am i reading firstimpression on these shorts I will givethem a 6 out of 10 I feel like the fitis really comfortable the length is alittle bit awkward on the shorts thematerial isn't my favorite but they dofeel high-quality so let's go work out[Music]okay so I'm home from the gym let's talkabout how this little gym shark ensembleheld up so my little kind of likeroutine at the gym is I start up on thebike and then I do a my weight trainingcircuits and then I do some time on thetreadmill and that's kind of the flow ofthings so on the bike and doing myweight training these shorts wereperfectly comfortable and I was honestlyreally surprised I don't like reallyworking out in shorts in general andthese ones especially I was worried thatthe material was gonna be too heavy andI wasn't gonna like the cut but it wastotally fine actually during those partsnow the problem came when I startedrunning and he's short started to rideup like crazy and I was having to pullthem down and readjust them a lot itwasn't the most comfortable thing towear while running it definitely kind oftook away from the experience a littlebit but I will say during my bike and mycircuit training I did not notice anyproblems with the shorts it was reallyonly when I was running and the materialof these shorts did not bother me theway I expected them to they werehonestly really comfortable they weren'ttoo heavy I think they look a little bitthicker than they actually are thematerial was totally fine and thissports bra is actually really great andI'm super picky with sports bras so Ithink the big thing that I love aboutthis is the adjustable straps it made itso that it actually can fit me the onlything I will say is that band because itis like a little bit longer you have allthis it would start to ride up kind oflike that and I would have to pull itdown but that only happened a few timesit wasn't a big deal that was literallythe only negative about the sports brait was relatively supportive I'd put itout like a medium impact support felttotally fineduring my bike and my weight circuit andwhat I was walking on the treadmill itwas fine when I was running on thetreadmill it was okay I would need alittle bit more support to be totallycomfortable I think I'll wear both ofthese again for sure the sports braprobably more than the shorts but Idon't really have a lot of shorts I liketo workout in becauseI just prefer Lighting's a lot so myrating on the shorts is definitely gonnabe skewed because I'm a leggings girlbut these shorts were pretty good forshort salting the shorts a 7 out of 10and the sports bra I'm gonna give it a 9out of 10 I thought it was really reallygood the only thing that could beimproved on this would be a little bitmore support for my third outfit Iwanted to do one of their matching setsthey have these really cute sets wherethe sports bra and the leggings match soI ordered the matching sports bra andleggings but then I also ordered apurple top to go over it if I don't feelcomfortable just working out in thesports bra so these are the floortexture leggings in charcoal marl andthese are $55 which is definitely priceyfor leggings but like the other onesthey feel really nice and then thesports bra is in the same like patternand color also in an extra large andthis one is $40 it also has like acrisscross in the background so I thatmight be kind of like difficult tofigure out but we'll seeand then the flouse Lounge let's notlike Sleepy lounge I don't know slouchedcinched tee in steel blue for $25 whichI feel like isn't a crazy price for aworkout t-shirt it's just kind of like anormal t-shirt but then in the back ithas this like like cinched part which Iguess is why it's called the cinchedteam so let's try this outfit on okay soI feel like I like the color and thetexture of this set better than the pinkone but the fit and the material isn'tnearly as good so this set is much morelike cotton and the first set was muchmore like spandex II kind of like slicktypical workout material the sports brait fits me well in the chest but it'sactually a little bit loose in like theband right here that kind of hits itright above my waist and the straps onthis one are not adjustableunlike the purple sports bra I love thehigh waist and fit of the pants you guysknow I'm all about high waist so theseones fit really well and the sizing isdefinitely on point with the pants thematerial like I said it's I don't knowit's kind of like a weird workoutmaterial Iknow how I'm gonna like working out andlike cottony pants that might beinteresting but the material definitelyfeels like thick enough that it's notgoing to be see-through if I'm likesquatting or doing stretching oranything like thatlet's give it a 7 out of 10 I'm feelinggood about it I have some concerns butlet's try it on with the purple top andsee how that works so here is the topit's listed online as steel blue but inperson it's definitely more of like apurpley lavender but I like both colorsso I don't really mind at all the cinchin the back is kind of interesting I'venever worn something like this I don'tknow how comfortable that's gonna bewhat I'm working out usually I like likelow maintenance t-shirts when I'm at thegym I really like the cut of this thoughhow it goes up at the sides is reallycomfortable and flattering the v-neck isit too low I feel like I can move inthis and not be worried about like toomuch showing but I'm actually surprisedI feel like I would be comfortableworking out without this top like theamount of skin showing between thesports bra and the leggings isn't toomuch for me they're leggings are way wayway high-waisted like I expected them tohit like at my belly button high waistedbut clearly they're very very high to afirst impression of the purple top I'mgonna give it I'm gonna give it also a 7out of 10 I feel like this whole thingis just kind of giving me 7 out of 10vibes okay so I am wearing my gym sharkapparel I just got done with a SoulCyclepause so let's talk about how this heldup I've got the bra underneath and Iactually took this shirt off after thefirst look five minutes so I was in justthe bra and the leggings for most of thetime this shirt only for a little bitSoulCycle if you guys have never doneSoulCycle they keep the room reallyreally hot it's like 90 or 100 degreesin there and this material is notbreathable the leggings and the topespecially these leggings I felt so muchlike hotter and more uncomfortable inthis than I did in like the typical likespandex lycra workout material itdefinitely is not very breathable but itis comfortable I will say that like it'svery soft I felt totally great moving init just wasn't as breathable also theseleggings and the top are both a littlebit loose on me you can see the sportsbra doesn't fit quite properly and it'snot adjustable so it didn't give me thekind of support that I needed whichwasn't too bad for SoulCycle cuz you'renot like jumping or moving that much youknow you're on a bike so there's notthat much like up and downbut even when we were just doing littlemovements I didn't feel like I wassupported in us I can't imagine wearingthis to go like on a run or somethingthat would not be comfortable and theleggings also are a little bit loose inthe waist and I felt like I had to keeppulling them up and keep adjusting themwhich you know when it comes to workoutpants I like something I can just put onand not even think about it I will saythat this material repelled sweat prettywell even though it isn't as breathableit just kind of absorbed this one Iguess you can't really see it the purpletop is definitely breathable it's a nicematerial it's a nice cut it does look alittle bit like scrubs because of like Idon't know the structure of it at thecolor and then like the cinch in theback but I like the top I'll definitelybe wearing it after this video and thepants also don't have pockets whichagain for SoulCycle wasn't a big dealbecause I don't have my phone but likewearing this to the gym or on a run Iwould definitely want to have pockets onthe side and it has the same waistbandproblem as the first set of gym sharkleggings that I wore where it doesn'treally hold you in that much and eventhough it is high-waisted the thick partof the waistband is pretty small so I dolike the look of this outfit you knowwith or without the purple top I thinkit's cute so you know I think I'm gonnagive this outfit as a whole of five outof ten I wish it could be higher becauseI do think it's cute and the material iscomfortable the main issue for me reallyis just the looseness of the pants andespecially the sports bra I just didn'tfeel very supported through the workoutand then for my fourth and final outfitI went for a more like casual kind oflike hiked run type set less like in thegym look so we've got the everydayjogger and the everyday pullover both ofwhich are $45 so here is C joggers thematerial is pretty thick and I live inSouthern California where it gets prettyhot so I don't know how working out andthis would work but maybe I'll wear thissound like a hike or something this weekand then the sweatshirt I'm getting aworkout just opening all these packageshere is the cropped pullover hoodieI love cropped hoodies like this I thinkthey are so cute so I'm very veryexcited for this let's try it on okay weare not gonna do any cute posing shotsin this one because it is freakingboiling it is so hot I'm sweating I'vebeen in this for 30 seconds and I justwant to get out we dab my sweat it'sliterally like 65 degrees and I amstudies because that's how heavy and hotthis is so a stepping aside from that Ifeel like this is very like gym teacherfrom middle school who yells at you torun faster when you're doing the milelike the matching like top and bottomit's it's a lie I like the printing downthe side I feel like that's cute it kindof reminds me of the James Charles's orapparel review that I did but the JamesCharles clothes were much morebreathable and light this is very heavyI I'm just standing here and I'msweating I don't know how the heck I'mgonna workout in this I'm gonna be sohot so first impressions of this I'mreally trying not to focus too hard onthe fact that I am sweaty and miserablebecause that's not really fair but thematerial is heavy and that's not a goodthing so I guess I do kind of have totake it in mindfirst impressions I'm gonna give thisset a six out of ten I feel like that'spretty fair good morning it is 6:50 a.m.and it's about 46 degrees outside I amgonna go on an early morning hike andI'm wearing my little Jim sharks wetsuitI thought you know what if I'm gonnagive this very warm thing a fair shot Ishould wear it in weather that actuallycalls for it so yeah let's go on a hikeand hopefully this keeps me warm but nottoo warm[Music]okay I am just at the end of my hike andI figured this would be a nice littlequiet spot to tell you guys my thoughtson this Jim shark outfit after actuallywearing it for a day well not a day ohor cap you know what I mean okay so I'vetotally changed my tune on this littlejogger set after actually wearing it inweather that calls for something likethis so one of my favorite things aboutthis set is that the sweatshirt haselastic right here at the bottom so whenI was first starting my hiking I wasreally coldI had it pulled all the way down so thatno skin was exposed and then once Istarted moving and running a little bitand getting hot I could pull it up andthis is elastic so it actually stays upand give myself some like room for myskin to breathe right there so that wasreally nice I really liked that and theelastic just makes it more flatteringeven when it's pulled down it stillgives my body some definition andobviously I was miserable in somethinglike this indoors at like 70 degrees theoutside at 7:00 in the morning when it'slike 48 degrees this is perfect reallyreally perfect for this type of weatherif you like to do activity outdoors andyou live in a colder climate or you livein a climate like I do but you just liketo go outside early in the morning thisis a great outfit for this it's warm butthe material isn't too constricting Ifelt like totally comfortable moving andrunning it is interesting that they'dsell a set that is this warm from acompany called Jim shark because I wouldnever resist ooh the gymliterally anywhere that's likeclimate-controlled indoors this would bepretty miserable but for outside on anearly morning hike this is pretty greatthe only thing that would be a littlebit better if the material was a littlebit more breathable because now that Iam sweating a little bit I just kind ofstart to feel it on my back which isyuck so yeah I like this outfit way wayway more than I expected to so now thatI've tried the clothes and worn them fora workout what's the final verdict onJim shark so I'm pretty picky when itcomes to leggings and I wasn't superimpressed with the Jim shark leggings Idefinitely prefer my Lululemon leggingsand my fabletics likings both over thegym shark leggings the pink ones showeda lot of sweat and imperfections on mylegs and the gray ones just weren'tsuper comfortable and didn't fit mequite right a good thing though is thatboth of these leggings were squat proofyou could not see any of my Underthrough these leggings they were thickenough for that so that's a positive andLululemon is much more expensive thanJim shark so I would expect thoseleggings to be nicer than the gym shirtones but fabletics is cheaper than Jimshark and I still like those leggingsmore I really liked the tops thoughespecially the pink tank top from thefirst outfit that was my favorite andthe sweat suit is gonna be great forearly morning hikes and runs and justlike chillin around the house being cozyI think the gym shirt quality doespretty much match up with the priceespecially for the tops and sports brasI think those are their best items and Iam so glad that they're fit is prettymuch universal throughout their wholeline which is so so important for anonline brandI followed the sizing chart andeverything actually fit me which prettymuch never happens when I'm shoppingonline so that was pretty awesome thegray two-piece set was a little bit bigI think I could have sized down in thatbut that's the only thing that was alittle bit iffy and even then it stillworked I'm pretty impressed with Jimshark I would consider ordering fromthem againespecially for sports bras and tops butI think for leggings I'm gonna stickwith Lululemon and fabletics also theydo only go up to an extra-large on theirwebsite I wish that they had a moreinclusive sizing so that women of allsizes could try their items but maybethey'll expand in the future so what doyou think based on my review all thepositives and negatives that I gave doyou think that you would order from themdo you think it's worth the money and

with the stream louder what's up guys soI'm actually coming to you with a reviewvideo of something that I've never youknow it's a completely new product forme a completely new company so if youhaven't guessed it already it is in thetitle I am reviewing the new gem sharkleggings that they came out in this drymoisture management material and I'mgonna pretty much be giving you guys mythoughts my opinions and this is anhonest honest review so I just want tolet you guys know that I bought theleggings with my own money so of courseI'm gonna give you guys an honestopinions I'm gonna be showing you guysnow those and I got those in a mediumnow I was kind of on the fence withsizing because the sizing on the gymshark website is a little bit confusingjust because it's actually a UK brainand I never knew that before I orderedso the sizes are a little bit differentthan us size is where I am located inthe u.s. the subtotal for the leggingswas $43 that's how much they retailonline and I used a 10% coupon code fromJasmine Garcia who is a youtuber who issponsored by Jim shark so I've actuallysaw them on her and I loved the meshdetail on the side which is one of themain reasons why I decided to take theleap and purchase my very first Jimcharcoal eye things so I paid a total of48 69 I'm actually checking right nowexactly what I paid I paid it's 43dollars plus $9.99 for shipping andhandling if you're shipping to the US Iused a discount which was minus 4dollars and 30 cents so total 48.69cents let me give you the pros and I'mgoing to give you the cons first I'mgoing to give you the pros number onethe prices is it's like super superaffordable 48 dollars for elevensespretty pretty affordable nowadaysbecause Nike alone can bring you up ahundred dollars per legging 80 plus youknow depending on the style depending onthe size and depending if they're brandspanking new and on trend that's umcompared to price-wise Lululemon also isanother very popular legging brand andthey are also super expensive too sothat's something to think about thatthese are pretty much 50% off or lessthan 50% of what you would pay for aNike or Lululemon another pro is thestyle it's something very very uniquethey have the leg I'm going to show youguys they have the pockets on the sidelike on both sides of the legging andthe mesh detailing which is somethingsuper super unique I've never seen apocket like leggings with pockets on theside like that before ever and so thatright there once I like I saw and I feltthat there were pockets I mean that'sjust genius that's literally genius ofJim shock right there because all of usladies know that it is so frustrating towear like those armband things or let'ssay you forgot your arm bin and you needsomething to put your phone in you knowlet's say you're listening to music orsomething just put it in your pocket andyou know on your side pocket then versusyou know what we usually do just likestuff it in our bra so that wassomething that super super genius thatwas one of my second Pro for that thirdPro is actually the material isn't toobadthe material actually reminds me a lotof a combination of Lululemon slashUnder Armour but more on the UnderArmour side they feel like a trainingtype of Under Armour lugging your carlike a spandex type of legging materialanother pro which is one of the hugesthugest was the company overall Jim sharkliterally sent my leggings out and I gotthem in two days two freakin days Iordered them and literally in two daystwo of the following days they werealready at my door waiting for me sothat right there is awesome the shippingis super super fast which I was notexpecting when I was thinking UK brandI'm thinking okay these are gonna takelike two weeks to get to me or we gonnahave to get to me it's not even Nikegets to me this famine sit here I'mgonna talk about the cons and I'm justgonna be straight up and forward withyou guys nothing is gonna be perfectokay clearly nothing is going to beperfect I'm a huge Nike and Lou I'm inlegging purchaser more on the Nikethan Lululemon I just started gettinginto Lululemon leggings and the pricepoint is is obviously 50% so obviouslythe quality you can't really compare thequality but if I had to pick betweenNike and Jim shark leggings I'm gonnastick with my Nike and Lululemonleggings versus the gym sharkunfortunately and I'm just gonna sayfour one one big reason and this isprobably you know it this is probablythe only really huge con for me was thatthey're high waisted leggings butthere's no kind of molding materialwhere your stomach area is your yourmidsection is if that makes sense soit's like legging and then you're gonnaget you're gonna see now if you havesix-pack abs if your abs are flat andawesome you'll probably love these theseare probably your best leggings if youdon't have a kangaroo pouch which all myladies if you're watching this you knowwhat that is if you don't have anystomach bulge if you don't have a muffintop if you literally have a very slimwaist and literally no stomach these aregoing to be the perfect leggings for youand you're gonna love them now forsomebody who is on a little bit of thethicker side and has a little bit of akangaroo pouch which I do and who hassubstantially a little bit more body fatthan most fitness models like I do thenyou may or may not like these I for somereason and not I don't feel comfortablewhen I wear these leggings they give mekind of like I'm not sure if it's themesh or what I'm not I'm not really surebut they don't hug me like Lululemonhigh-time pants do they don't hug melike a Nike sculpt type pant does inthat midsection in that waist areasection and for my ladies who know howdifficult it is to find leggings thatfit you the way you want them to it'sit's huge it's a huge huge deal andthese just didn't fit the bill like theyjust don't meet my standards in terms ofthat and that's really my onlya really big cause one of the thingsthat frustrated me with these leggingsafter wearing them a few times I needsome support in my midsection to keep mesucked in okay I need that support I'mnot as lean as I wanna be right nowand these gym shark leggings just kindof accentuate that little tummy kangaroopouch section slash muffin top area andI was just just don't like that look andI'm not not for it maybe it's just mepicking out something very small itcould be I'm I mean I'm I look at everysingle little detail it could just be meand other people might not have thatissue or might not think it's a problembut it's me it's my opinion and that iswhat I think about um overall I mean I'drather pay more for leggings that aregonna fit me good versus leggings thataren't gonna fit me good and then I'mconstantly feeling a littleself-conscious about in the gym andthat's just really my biggest pipe withthese I'm not very I'm not really hugelyimpressed in another second con which Ijust want to point out and I feel likethis is probably something that ispretty common with Jim shark leggings isthat they're a little see-through nowthey're not extremely see-through to thepoint where you know all you can see isbutt cheeks they're see-through to theto the point where it's like I can seemy thigh and I'm pretty sure if I'msquatting you could probably see thepatterns on my underwear or whatever ifI'm wearing something other than blackunderwear so that's something to keep inmind guys these aren't completely opaquethey are a little see-through overallI'm not bashing Jim shark whatsoever Ithink the way that they handled theircustomer service the fact the shippingwas so fast and just overall like eventhe packaging like look at these tagsguys like this is this is this fancyokay um you know they even give you likea little little thing here you knowthat's in the leggings and like look atthis like just packaging words like theyreally hit it my thing is the wholekeeping me tight in the areas that Iwant to be kept tight that's my biggestissue Sam and the material just I'm nota huge fan of them andthese leggings are made of and that'sjust my own personal preference afterthis experience I probably wouldn't buyanymore leggings from Jim Shack justbecause I'm not really feeling thequality too much in terms of what Iexpected quality they just they're justnot there but because of the price pointit's kind of like a you know win or losetype of thing you get what you pay foralright guys so that was my review thoseare my thoughts the pros and cons of theJim Shack leggings now clearly theydon't have like the leggings don't havea lot of cons they I felt like I had alittle bit more pros and cons but thebiggest con was the fit for me andthat's gonna pretty much be the sellingpoint and it just didn't for mepersonally it didn't work out but whoknows maybe they'll come out withdifferent leggings that have a littlebit more of a form-fitting type ofmaterial for us ladies who have thatkangaroo pouch that we can't get rid ofso I just want to say that I hope youguys enjoyed the video I hope you guysenjoyed this review if you like videoslike this throw this video a like sothat I can know that you

hey guys and welcome back to my channeland today we are doing a super superhighly requested review we are reviewingthe gym shark high support sports brasso this is super exciting because thisis gym sharks first high support sportsbra ever which they have actually madesome decent support sports bras in thepast not all of their bras of course butI like that they're even saying thatthis is their first true I supportsports bra because it definitely offersmore support than a lot this issomething that's definitely new to gymsharks definitely something I feel likethey've been lacking for a whileespecially when I was shopping on gymshark a few years ago when they hadtheir original energy seamless setstheir flex sets all of the sports braswere pretty light support and when I wasa little bit heavier my boobs were abouta cup size biggerI really couldn't wear those sports brasso I loved that they're trying to dohigh support sports bras well put themto the test today and see if they arehigh support but either way I think it'sdefinitely more inclusive to have a highsupport range for the girls with biggergirls and something that they've beendoing lately is making more affordableitems I never reviewed their trainingleggings that were like I think likethirty dollars but some of the sportsbras that they release in thiscollection were 25 dollars in the maxprice is $40 in Forrest worth bra thatis actually truly high support fortydollars is not a lot of money when I wasdoing a lot of dancing and really had tolike you know hold the girls down I wasspending a lot of money on high supportsports bras because you really neededthat so I love that they're making thismore affordable for people and there's alot of features on these sports brasthat I definitely look for when it comesto a high support sports bra sodefinitely excited for this before webegin it's time for a little discomfortso I did receive these items from Jimshark to review they did send them to meI know I know it's crazy what is goingon you guys know the number one priorityfor me and my channel is to be 100%honest in my reviews so I did denypayment for this review so this iscompletely unspun surd and I made itvery clear that this review will be 100%honest as all of my reviews are but youguys know I do always want to take theopportunity to review things if I get achance especially pre-launch I do wishthat I was able to review thesepre-launch for you guys butunfortunately the way things worked outit just wasn't able to happenso hopefully this review isn't too latebut I know a lot of these fourth rowsare still in stock so Jim shark did makesix new sports bras I have four of themhere today I have two of the mediumsupport sports bras and two of the highsupport on the website it is very clearthey do label the support level I willbeginmy own ratings of what I think thesupport level is because I'm very pickyabout my support level I do we're at 32Triple D bra size and I feel like a lotof people throw around the terms likemedium and high support so I will beactually giving them my own ratings theydid aim to make these sports bras veryfunctional and comfortable so we'll alsosee that so far the fabrics actually dofeel pretty soft all the sports propsare pretty basic and they do all come inbasic colors and some brighter colors sothey are definitely good for like mixingand matching with leggings they're notlike too crazy anything going on firstwe have the racerback training sportsbra this is a medium impact bra justlooking at it I actually think that itmight even be a high impact the sportsbar has actually made of a super softbrushed fabric I wasn't expecting thefabrics to be brushed but they arereally really soft kind of feels likethe gym shark X Whitney collectionmaterial so it is still thin but it isbrush this sports products have ascooped neckline these straps are thickand elastic and they're also adjustablewhich is really nice to see on ahigh-impact medium impact sports bra theback does have a racerback mesh detailand the back also does have a doublehook closure so you are able to adjustit a little bit for your size needshere's a close-up of the fabric I knowit's black so it might be a little hardto see but it is brushed in somethingI've made many a rant about is removablecut padsI think removable cup pads are reallycheap and I don't like them and let mesay I am very excited to see that chipshark actually made sewn-in cut pads ifI'm looking for a high impact sports braI'm looking for sewn and cut paths sothese cut pads are molded and sewn intothe bra around them is kind of abreathable mesh material and the cutpads themselves do look like regular cutpads but they are sewn in so they're notgonna get crinkled up they're not gonnamove around they're gonna stay in theirplace where they should be so I got thissports brand a size small I believe itcomes in size extra small throughextra-large I do have to say for highimpact sports bras I usually like to seelike at least like a small like athrough C a small D through F like atleast some sort of range because I dothink sports bras fit a little bitdifferently if you have like an Athrough C cup versus like a D through Fcup so that's definitely something Iwish they would have done but I did getmy normal size small that's my normalsports bra size so we'll see if thesefit okay so so far I'm really not mad atthis sports brawearing size small all my measurementswill be down below I didn't put this onthe tightest clasp I could have probablydone the medium as well the band fits mereally nicely and I do wear a size 32band and the adjustable straps werereally nice I did tighten mine up quitea bit and yeah I'm totally fitting intothis sports bra it does have a prettyscooped neck but I don't feel likethere's a whole lot of cleavage going onthere's no side boob spillage happeningso I'm very covered up on the side whichI was like I don't like it's not a trendfor the gym the fabric is actually supersoft which is really nice I wouldn'texpect this fabric to be entirely sweatproof though it is pretty thick becauseof like the pads and everything so a lotof layers for the sweat to penetrate youknow but because it is our brushmaterial probably which I sweatobviously not in the black but othercolors but because the fabric is brushedand really soft I'm not having any ofthat like itchy irritation in the armpitregion in terms of support I'm reallynot jiggling at all this one is labeledas a medium support but I'm not reallysure why to be honest I think thisshould be a thigh support there wasn'tany jiggling and I honestly feel reallysecure and there's no spillage the backis pretty open and I do like Razorbacksports bras just because the straps arenever gonna fall down so that'sdefinitely nice there are no realdetails on the front of this sports brabut there is a little mesh in the backyeah i'ma say this one's pretty goodI would say this is definitely highsport[Music]next we have the ruched training sportsbra this one is a medium impact as welland it's only 25 dollarsI'm actually still waiting for it toarrive so I will insert a little clip ofme back with the review for the rest ofthis but I'll talk about a few pointsfirst this sports part really remindedme of the gym Sharkey's sports bra thegym Trekkies sports bra was super superpopular I know a lot of you guys havebeen looking for it ever since it wasdiscontinued and this is a kind of brathat even like old gym shark athletesthat are no longer working with yourshark I still see them wearing thesebras because they really liked it sodefinitely glad they kind of brought itback but it looks like a little moresupport this Brown does have removablecut pads so not my favorite but I know alot of people don't mind them there's alittle ruched detail on the front tokind of separate the boobies a littlebit the bra does have adjustable crossback straps so we love their adjustableand the cross and the band helps makesure they're not gonna fall off andthere is a little mesh panel in the backfor some breathability as well okay sohere's the Roush front bra the materialis also brushed on this one it does havethe ruching which I think it's kind ofnice because it gives like a little bitof separation just so it doesn't looklike I don't know like uniboob has thelittle logo here again it's just likethe press on one this one has a nicescoop neck it has like a little morecleavage than some of the other ones butI definitely not like spilling out and Idon't think it's like too much and thereactually is like pretty good side boobcoverage so what's safe if you're abigger cup size this one would stilllike cover a decent amount for you sothis one is a solid medium supportdefinitely not as high as the other onesbut I'm really not jiggling a lot andit's actually pretty impressiveconsidering the like spaghetti strapsthey're not like the thinnest strapsI've ever seen but they're definitelylike still spaghetti straps the strapsare adjustable as well I just had tolike to loosen mine a little bit just togive me a little more space but it didfit me the band fits me perfectly sodefinitely stay true to size this is asize small but if you're in between Iwould size up it's a little tight on meso if I was any bigger it would be toosmall but at least in this current sizeit actually fits well and it has alittle mesh panel in the back it'spretty subtle like you don't really evensee it especially in the darker colorsmight be a little more noticeable in thewhite but it is there but yeah I thinkthis one's sold out right now at leastin the white the other colors it's stillin stock but I definitely think it's anice basic $25 is super forso I really don't have any bad things tosay I wouldn't tell ever expect this tobe sweat-proof because material isbrushed and this one isn't as thick asthe other sports for us so I feel like Iwould see something under boots whygoing on next we have the open backtraining bra and this is one of theirhigh support sports bras definitelylooking like a high support when I lookat it this bra is $40 so all of the highimpact bras are $40 again this comes insize extra small to extra large I gotthis nice small this is definitely thetype of bra that I expect there to be atleast some sort of cuff range so we'llsee if this does fit a bigger cup sizeso this bra it's not even like sewn incut pads like it's totally like apreformed like cup area so the girls sitright in these little molded areas Iwould be interested to see how these fita smaller cup size because they aremolded we will obviously see how theyfit me but this kind of pre-molded thingdoes provide a lot of support usuallythe fabric is similar to the other brasit is a brushed material and it's mostlyreally really soft the top of the brahas a little mesh detail the bottom isactually a super thick elastic so thisshould potentially help with keeping thegirls kind of in place down there itdoes have a little gym shark logo on theside here it is just their classic likeheat seal branding so there is some riskfor it peeling off I would like to seemaybe like a little like rubberized logoor something the straps do come in to aracerbackand then they do have a slight area ofadjustable nests you're not gonna haveas much room to adjust the straps as theblack medium impact bra but there stillis some space here and you have a doublehook closure as well so here we have theopen back high-impact bra and there'ssome things I like about this bra butthere's also a few complaints I have sodefinitely love the soft brushed fabricI think that's really nice the cut padsare also pre-molded so they do give alot of shape I do like a little meshdetail I think it adds like a nicelittle contrast so I actually reallylike this little elastic at the bottom Ithink it makes it really easy to use thelittle clasp in the back just and notthe uncomfortable and even though it'slike kind of a raw edge not really rawedge but it is long elastic it'sactually not very uncomfortable at allit's actually I think like brushed forthe inside so it is pretty soft so mycomplaint with this one is because thecut pads are pre-molded but the bra onlycame in size extra small throughextra-large with no cup size differencesI don't think that the pre molded cuppads are really gonna fit everyone I ama Triple D cup size and I do have to sayI feel like my boobs want to go out alittle more the molded cup pad kind ofends here but you can see I'm kind ofextending out a little bit so I think itmight actually be a little too big forthis bra but I don't think the issue isin the sizing of the bra because thesmall dust fit me really well in theband and if I size up the band wouldprobably be too big so I think it isjust an issue of the molded cups notreally fitting everyone which makessense to me because I wouldn't expect amolded cup to fit every cup size becauseI mean it's the cups you've differentcup sizesI think this bra would be better suitedfor like a C to D cup size and no muchlike a double to triple D but I thinkit's just a little small for me like Ican definitely wear it still but it'snot a perfect fit on the plus side it'snot uncomfortable and it still isoffering a decent amount of support buthonestly I think the medium impactsports bra with these own in actual cutpads I think that actually offered me alittle more support because the cuffsjust mold it to me a little better so Ido actually prefer this one even forsupport which is kind of interesting andthis was cheaper so not mad about thatthis one also has less room to adjustthe straps so if you often have an issuewith straps being too long I'm not surethis would be the sports bra for you theother one might be better because thestraps adjusts like the whole way[Music]and lastly we have the mesh necklinehigh impact of training sports bra thisone I have actually worn so far anddefinitely you did hold the girls inthis bra has the same kind of preformedcup region as the last high-impact brait also has a band along the bottom butthis one is made of the brushed fabricit's not the same elastic material asthe last high impact brow this one ismore of a high neck sports bra it doeskind of come in in the middle a littlebit kind of similar to I'm wearing theflawless in a sports bar right now andit does have a similar neckline thesports bra does have a mesh panel in themiddle so it is a little bit breathablethere are also mesh panels that goaround the back as welland the bra also has the hook closure itkind of has like a little double strapsituation going on but the top strap isadjustable and this comes in a bunch ofcolors but I thought this little greenwas nice I think this green might matchthe camo let's see so this is the gymshark camo and actually the green doesmatch pretty well so if you want to mixit back to the camo it does work andhere's the last sports bra this isanother high-impact bra and I think Ilike the shape of this one better on methan velox high-impact bra I do reallylike the high neckline and I like thelittle mesh v detail this one because itis a high neckline you're obviously nothaving any cleavage issues here but I dohave a little bit of side boob I thinkthat this is again due to the fact thatthe cut pads are pre molded and I thinkmy boobs are just a little bit big forthe pre molded cup pads so I am having alittle bit of spillage and I also feellike I'm coming out of the top here thecup ads themselves and about here and myboobs are feeling like they're stillkind of pushed up here so I'm containedand I don't feel like I'm gonna spillout of this bra at all but if you dohave a bigger cup size again I wouldjust keep in mind that this might not bethe perfect fit for you so again I thinkthis is more for a C to D cup range notfor a double D Plus that being said itis super high support oftentimes withbras that come up really high I justfind that they do a really good job oflike keeping the girls in and notbouncing around the bra does have somecute panel details on the side and itgoes mesh around here as well as in thefront the straps are adjustable but Ipersonally didn't even have to adjustthese but they are available to adjustif you need and again I have it on thetightest hook so I still think that theyare pretty true to size in terms of bandsizeand I like the colors that these come inthey come in a good range of neutralsand some kind of cute colors so yeah[Music]all right so that's it for the highimpact sports Pro review I'm kind ofsurprised I felt like the medium impactsfor the real winners here I just reallyliked how that black medium impactsports breath fit me and I feel like itwould definitely mold to a lot of cupsizes it would be great to see them comeout with a high impact line that's likemore aimed towards like bigger cup sizesto really fit the girls the bigger girlsbut overall I think for most capsizes alot of these sports bras would fit and Ireally like how they're a little moreaffordable than usual gym sharks worksfor usPete was in the middle of taking alittle nap but she did want to come

I was the first ever Jim shark athlete Iremember the first ever t-shirts and thefirst ever string is and helping figureout what needed changing what to adjustand then being part of that first-everbody power show and just thinking thisis going to be something specialI think what brought us together was alike-minded vision mine for thelifestyle the fitness and the nutritionthe athletes should be following andtheir game-changing plans for the futurenow the game has changed and my lifewith it as an athlete that was part of acompany that was very different to theone it exists today it would have beenall too easy for Jim sharp to move onfrom me to forget their roots but thathas never been the case the gym shopfamily is no gimmick once you're part ofthis family it will change your lifeyouyouso ever since I was little I've alwayshave always been physically orientatedin towards the thing of my mother wouldif I was cranky send me out on a run andthat would calm me down a comeback andbe happy you know I'd be a helpfulprobably more than anything and I thinkeverything from that moment of being achild and involved in sports throughschool and things like that is veryclear that's what I enjoyed doing as Iwas getting older I started to alsoinvolve myself more in the gym life asfar as it was as in terms of going tothe gym carrying a mammoth busy caringabout my health in terms of how do youhow do I feel I look in the mirror howdo I feel about myself is there anythingI'd like to change not because offeeling inadequate in any way like a lotof people feel it suits more of a whatwould I like to changecan I change and then setting that goaland this was this is one kind of sportand fitness and everything is to me it'sthe abilities of the set goals setchallenges and achieve those goals youhave the ability to change something andyou don't take that that chance tochange it you have no rights to evercomplain about that againI completed my degree qualified as afitness instructor and at the same timewas working another job with insecuritywithin you know clubs and publishing allthat in the UK scene and one of the guysthere was a Thai boxer so he took meinto the Thai and and what I got onthere with was the level of respectingand again teamwork that goes intowalking into a dojo of any kind it'scalled fighting but fighting sounds soaggressive when the level of respectwithin that room is huge and the factthat they welcome new people through adoor that they don't know and bring theminto this little family it was just it'san overwhelming experience if you ifyou're if you ever put yourself withinsuch a tight-knit little family and ateam and they have people around youhelping you supporting you and pushingyou forward to challenge yourself whenyou don't think you can do something youget frustrated and they just shut youdownpush it forward again and push youforward again and you'll get it makesyou realize that when you have the rightpeople around you and you're doingsomething you love things you thoughtwere impossible become very possible andput in facts the possible ended uppicking it up pretty quickly and andlong story short after a few months oftraining there got coerced into maybehaving enjoyed a little tournament atthe time it was old school honorsold-fashioned ones wavers a you fight tostay on kind of thing and I had fivefights in one day and ended up winningthis little local tournamentso for years on I'm still fighting inMMA and it's part of my life is part ofthe world and I had a title fight Idropped down from pro fighting that tosemi pro to get this title shot becauseit was you know it was another goalanother achievement to hit and longstory short the fight ended up being ano contest due to a referee error it wasa massive come down huge and it was abit of an eye opener and a realizationis - and what am I doing this for andwhy and it was more part of thechallenge and the love of sport ingeneral that I was doing it for and atthe same time I was given an opportunityto go down to London do some shootingfor a well-known magazine FitnessMagazine you know and something badhappens in your life when somethingreally does crush you short term yesthat's terrible and it can really affectyou but long term sometimes those thingsthat at the time seemed bad are some ofthe best things to ever happen to youbecause they create a mold your futurein a way that might not have everhappened otherwise you know maybe I wasgiven an opportunity in life at thatpoint and I took that opportunity andthat was where I came into the wholefront of the fitness world and puttingmyself out there for people to see me asas something to look toward in terms offitness and maybe lifestyle and thingslike thatand that's where it led me to going togiving myself new goals and newchallenges one of which was to competein a bodybuilding show hi guys this isLex from a MBR natural body therecognition and this is my little blogyeah for the questions that you've beenasking regarding the diet frontobviously I'm competing now in themuscle mania on 31st of July so we'renot too far about two weeks out nowso it's for these shows that I wasgetting ready for I was you know I'm notgonna when I started I was completelybroke you know I was doing everything itwas it was the classic you knowsacrifice to win style heavy trainingheavy cardio low food sacrifice to winand it started to grind me down a littlebit and having the biology degreebackground I was always very interestedin looking into the nutritional side ofthings again and it was within one videothat I put up and it's I'm two weeks outfrom the show and it's at this pointmost people are coming towards the worstin these times you know they're they getvery tired looking very drawn and here'sme sat in the sunshine outside in theback garden the house shaitaan having abarbecue and I had a good physique youknow I was very lean I was I was veryaesthetically appealing and it sort ofpeople start to take note that I'mlooking like this while sapna barbecuingusual British sausages and white breadand I'm not not and the actual the theowners of Jim shark stumbled across thisvideo looked into it looked into who Iwas and it was actually that one videothat one point in time that video that Iput online put myself out there forother people to see that there are waysof doing things that you love andmaintaining your life and balance and itwas this they cottoned onto this it'salways a little bit different that madethem get in contact and that was thatwas the first part where myself and Jimshark came togetherwhen I say Jim shark at this point we'retalking about a couple of guys with agreat idea who had just started out theywere printing their own stringers andt-shirts at their parents house theywould send me some of the items thatthey were thinking of making so theywould literally have these items madethen they would print them themselvessend them to me I'd wear them literallytrained test them from every angle Icould and then I would send back my ownideas as to saying you know there needsto be a couple of inches here tighteningin at the waist if we could just take itan inch off the strap either side that'sgoing to make it sit a little betterthey take back on board what I'd say tothem and every time another item willcome by it got better and better andbetter and it was it was clear that youknow we were progressing in a really funway but it was it was it was alwaysgoing to be something great but it wasall something we enjoy doing you know itwas fun to see what changed from thesimple ideas we took to the next stepthe next step the next step you can seeit now in today they've gone continue toinnovate you're continued to keepsurpassing themselves in ideas andthat's what it's about when people sayfamily with it's not a gimmick thisisn't that we say it ourselves becauseit's the only way you can describe itwhether it be the people behind thecameras in front of the cameras that yousee on daily basis or the people thatare wearing the products as well you'rerepresenting a movement and lifestyle offeeling because I have people coming upand showing me a picture what they werelike and

[Music][Applause][Music]hey guys and welcome back to my channeltoday I am reviewing the able pulsecollection which is an ombre seamlesscollection with the original Jim shotgunvery seamless so I have Able's ombre inthree different colors I have thisreally cute pink color this gray toblack color and then this blue colorwhich I'm wearing the sports breathright now and so I used to have feed Jimshark like peach pink ombre ombreleggings and I have a bunch of videoclips with me and then that I'm gonnareference in this video but these areactually Jim truck dupes from to podiumso so these don't have like a gym trucklogo or anything but I've already donevideos comparing them and they are likeexactly the same so I will also be usingthis is a comparison point just so wecan really get down to the details ofwho does the ombre better like I saidfrom Abell they're not on Instagram asbe able but I think the brand is justcalled able so this collection is calledthe pulse collection and they have asports bra and legging so I'm gonna talkabout the Lightning's in the first halfand then I'm going to go and get intothe sports bra okay so since we'retalking about leggings first the pricefor the leggings is $36 which actuallyit's like a mid-range price point I'vesee I have a few Amazon leggings thatare actually like getting close to $30as well and Jim sharks I believe was atleast 45 I want to say more like 50 to55 so these are definitely much cheaperthan Jim sharks these are also a greatmid-range price so you still get like alittle bump in quality from like let'ssay like some amazon leggings but it'sstill a really great deal so for thefabric so I'm gonna talk about ablefirst their fabric composition is anylon polyester elastane and it feelsvery plush and thick it has a lot ofstretch to it so the able is definitelythicker than Jim sharks the fabric ofthe Able's kind of reminds me of a Jimshark like original Flex legging or aJim shark camo both leggings have amarled texture so the actual leggingslook very similar when you're not liketouching them but they definitely feel alot different the Jim shark has aslightly more slick feel while theAble's are a little more cottony andlike like a thick knit material I don'tthink either one has more compressionthe other I think both I would give thema light compression and as for which onehas morestretch I think I would say that Abelhas more stretch but Jim sharkdefinitely isn't stiff by any means Iwould just say Abel is just the tiniestbit stretchier so now on to thewaistbands so the Abel waistband is adouble thickness and it's ribbed intexture it also goes about right abovemy belly button just the tiniest bithigher than Jim sharks the waist movesmuch more tightly fitted than Jim sharkI will insert a video clip of myoriginal hombre seamless from Jim sharkbut their waist bands just stretched outso much and I don't think they were everlike quite right at my waist there'ssomething about the Jim shark waistbandjust really didn't fit your actual waistand it was always gaping and I alwayssaw the athletes in the videos with thewaist bands gaping wasn't cute the Abelwaistband actually tapers in a decentamount and I haven't had any stretchingout and I've done at least threeworkouts and these yeah you candefinitely tell that the waistband ishigher on the Jim sharks it's a solidlike centimeter more higher but you canalso see that on the Jim sharks thewaistband doesn't really come in verymuch it's just kind of like prettycontinuous but the sides of the leggingso you're not really going to get muchcompression and it's also not going totaper in very much but there's actuallya lot of tapering in on the waistbandfor the Able's and I really didn't haveany gaping for these so I think that's areally good attention to detail for thembecause I hate when the way waist bandsgape also you can see a slightdifference in the ribbing the ribbing onthe Able's was a little more tightlyknit and the ribbing on the Jim sharksis a little more separated the Able'sare just a little bit above full-lengthroomy so not quite full-length but I am509 so I'm on the taller side so ifyou're shorter they probably would befull length but they're just a littlebit above full length for me I have avideo clip that directly compares thebooty contouring but the bootycontouring on the Able's is very subtleyou'll see in the video clip but theAble's just have this kind of likerabbit material kind of like the thewaist band underneath the booty so kindof like compresses slightly underneathyour butt which kind of helps like liftthe butt a little bit and that's likedefinitely very helpful I feel likewithout this you have a lot less shapein these leggings and this booty contouris million times better than the Jimshark booty contour which I will insertclips even after I try to pull it upthat booty contour was in my midI honestly just made my butt look saggyand not cute and I didn't like it soAbel wins the booty contour literallymillion times over comparison of thebooty contours you can see on the Abel'sthe booty contour is just like thisribbed material kind of like thewaistband but just below the butt and itjust kind of squeezes your like thighand a little more and kind ofaccentuates the booty a little bit butnothing crazy and the gym sharks isobviously very much more pronounced theyhave like these little dot details andwhen it's on you can very much see it asa booty contour but you can't so muchsee you there's a booty contour on thetables and some of you guys have beenrequesting that I show like the seams onthe leggings and these seams actuallyseem pretty si seem pretty good qualityI haven't had any loose stitching Ihaven't felt any tightness I did a legday in these and I didn't feel like theseams were like restricting me in anyway there's actually a decent amount ofstretch to them so good seams here theleggings also have some nice raiseddetailing all the way down the legs andkind of connecting from the waistbandand I've got the sides of the leggingsso you can see some of the details theyvery similar detailing down the sidethey have kind of this raised detailingthat goes all the way down and then intosome more like complex raised detailsthat just add like a little nice bit oflike texture to the legs and jib sharkhas the same it has like a little raiseddetail up there kind of goes down tothese little like raised lines and thenmore down to the bottom and they bothactually kind of have a little back ofcalf detailing Jim shark is much moreprominent so you're definitely going toget like a lot of calf shading butunable it's just very subtle much liketheir booty contour is very subtle whichI like it's just like if you're lookingclose there's texture but if you're faraway it is not so both for Jim shark andfor Abel the logos are just kind of likea vinyl press on which I don't reallylove the vinyl pressings because I feltlike when I was wearing these the otherday that I just felt like these can justlike peel off like after you wash them acertain number of times it just doesn'tseem like they're gonna like stay verywell I wish they may be like embroideredtheir logo onto the legging because thatjust adds like a little bit more of likea luxurious feel so in terms of sizingthese come in size extra small to largeI wear small knees and I'm a small onbasically everything about a four to sixand Lululemonand these fit basically perfectly therewas a tiniest bit of extra room aroundthe crotch area but not in a way thatgave me a lot of single camel like therewas just a little bit of extra space butI felt overall the fit was really goodit didn't have any waistband gaping Ifelt like the legs fit me very well andI didn't feel like anything was pullingtoo tightly so are they true to size Iwould say yes true to size but if youare in between that I would size downbecause these do have a lot of stretchto them and they're just like thetiniest but on the big side and all ofthe colors I have are exactly the samein sizing and stretch and all the sizeswere very consistent so that makes itvery easy for ordering so in terms ofcellulite I would call these twocellulite friendly they don't have anycompression but the material is verythick and plush and I feel like thathelps hide the cellulite very well andit also has the marl texture whichalways helps as opposed to the plaincolored legging and I would say they'remore cellulite friendly than gym sharksbecause they do have that addedthickness which I think helps a lot somy new thing for testing of something asweat proof is just to like drop alittle drip of water on them and see ifit if you can see it or not and youcould definitely see the drop when I putit on the leggings but the marl texturedoes mask it a little bit so I'd saythese are like sweat friendly but likenot sweat proof ask for camel toe theable leggings didn't give me any cameltoe no single or double camel which isgreatJim shark once had this race front seamand the fabric is a little thinner itdid lend itself to some camel toe issuesat some points but the able ones I wasall good so for the booty scale so Igive the able leggings a medium to highon the booty scale they don't have a lotof compressions so they don't squishyour butt down in any way but they dohave that a little bit of like bootycontour underneath it kind of sucks inthe area right below your butt whichhelps just like add a little bit ofextra shape to the booty I wouldn't sayit's like the highest on the booty scalebecause with seamless leggings sometimesyou can get like a little unibodypearance so not like high booty scalebut my butt looked pretty good in thesethat's pretty proud and compared to theoriginal gym sharks on the booty scalethese are way better because theoriginal gym sharks with their bootycontour that was more like a thighcontour wasn't cute on the butt made mefeel saggy so and squat test let's justgive a little round of applause here allof these leggings are completely squatproof I amyour hard ass on my squat test like Ihave a ring light I have natural light Ihave everything and I am looking for anybit of Sheerness in these leggings allcompletely past ten to ten no issues andcompared to Jim shark I'm just gonnashow a squat test of my old peach pinkombre ones and you will deceive thehorrible Sheerness that is thoseleggings I give them like a 2 out of 10on the squad test now that we are donewith the leggings it is time to move onto the sports bras for the sports brasI'm mainly just going to go over theable one I do have the gym shark onethis is the gym shark dupe version andI'm going to compare like a side-by-sidehow they look but I'm not going to gointo like too many details on the gymshark one so the sports pros are $31 sokind of about the same as the leggingsjust a little bit less some details sothese have about medium to high coverageas you can see I'm not showing anycleavage for the sports but I definitelyhas a nice scooped neckline I love thedesign of the straps so it has a nicelittle racerback but then it has thislittle cute cutout opening so it hasthis little strappy looking back but itstill has like a decent amount ofcoverage in the back it's not like athin straps since I tend to wear mysports bras ask the shirts in the gymlike I don't really wear a shirt on topI like to look for a sports bra with adecent amount of coverage so I don'tfeel like completely naked the sportsbra also has some cute detailing it hassome of that race detailing that theleggings have so they have like a fewcute little lines and the French a fewin the back as well as some perforationdetails the sports bra is also very softso first of all it's very soft in feelbut it's also very soft like in likestructure there's no hard structuralelements there's no underwire anythinglike thatand the sports wear also doesn't rub onmy armpits sometimes sports bras ifthey're cut too high it can rub on yourarmpits but I have plenty of room hereand it's not doing any chafingso as for fit and sizing I am a 32Triple D and I have a small in this andit honestly I could have size down to anextra small it's like a little thereisn't too much gaping but I just feellike it's like a little bit loose and Iwould have liked a little bit morecompression if I had size down I feellike I would have gotten a nice amountof compression and this could have beenlike a medium support sports bra butbecause it was just a little bit big onme it is more of a white support soI would definitely say size down forthis I already have a larger chest soI'm usually between small and medium forsports bras for this small it's just alittle bit big for mebut even with this larger size I didn'treally have any like crazy amounts ofgaping so I'd say the fit on the sportsbra is overall really good and like it'sshaped very nicely here the sizing ofthe gym shark sports brought to thetable and the able definitely has like asignificant amount more room so I'mgonna go ahead and continue to say sizedown and this my only complaint is thatthe pads are not my favorite they dohave a nice amount of coverage which Ireally look for in a pad if it's toosmall a pad it can just kind of looklike a little circle on your boob butthese they got like a little bitdeformed in the shipping process I thinkthe first day I wore them one of themhad like a big dent in the boob and itjust like looked like there was a bigdent on my boob and it didn't reallybounce back super well so I'm gonna trymaybe washing these and that'll help Idefinitely think that you need the padson this bra especially if you got thewrong size like me because it just doesadd a little bit more structure andsupport to the bra so overall I'm reallyloving these able sets I think they didan incredible job of their leggings Iwish the sports bras fit me a littlebetter so I'd be like a little moreconfident wearing these like doing likea little more medium impact exercise butyeah guys I think that compared to theoriginal chip truck hombres Abel did anincredible job especially with thewaistband in the booty contour so let meknow if you guys enjoyed this video giveit a thumbs up if you did and I will seeyou next time bye[Music][Applause][Music],26,UCqOC1SiA6v994Sx_WR1-xew,Kathryn

I've been sitting here for the past fiveminutes trying to think of like a funand exciting intro to do that I can'treally think of one so we're just gonnago right into it[Music]what's up guys and welcome back to mychannel today I'm talking aboutsomething that I've been waiting for forapproximately one and a half weeksyou just remember when shipping used totake like two weeks and we were like ohthat's so fast ooh now with Amazonthey've spoiled us in every single wayand if something doesn't come in twodays I think it's lost in the mailanyway I got my Jim shark flawless knitcollection and I'm so excitedI caught this as a little treat tomyself because it wasn't cheap cheap butthat's okay because sometimes sometimesyou get itsplurge on yourself you know I'm sayingso that's what we're gonna talk abouttoday this is a new collection that Jimshark just came out with the only werehyping it up for about like a week or sousually jump shark hype soft leggingsfor like months and throw dip check outlike they're wearing it for months andyou're like okay could just get to thepoint but they really got to the pointwith these they were like you knoweveryone was wearing them in two weekslater they're like they're here and Iwas like I just spent money on the BlackFriday sale I wasn't ready for anotherrelease the camo guys like I can do thismy wallet I can't but I'm so excited totalk about these because this isprobably my pricing this abouteverything but probably one of myfavorites from Jim sharp so far so theflawless knit collection let me say it'snot without flaws but it's it's prettygreat like I really love these I feltlike I was I walked in with the tube Iwas feeling myself like it was a thesemake me feel pretty good about myself Ireally love them they're so flatteringthe high waist is perfect they have lesscompression than an energy seamless theyare so soft and don't restrict yourmovements at all and I just I meanoverall my review of these is great Ilove them the collection has a sportsbra the leggings a long-sleeve crop topand a tank topso whatever amount of skin your you wantor don't want to show this set got youcovered but I had to say get one thingit's probably the leggings also in thetitle of this is like a non sponsoredreview and like I don't know why I wouldsay that because likeclearly not Egyptian athlete doesn't theonly sponsors but just thought I wouldmake it clear to you guys so first thinglet's talk about the prizes becausethat's the thing that we hate the mostabout this set the leggings were $55which is like okay like a normal pricefor leggings Lululemon leggings are like$100 so this is a seal you want tocompare to that but this works if youdon't know I just like you to guess howmuch a sports prizethere are times up it's $45 I'm reallywanted the sports bra and I knew Iwanted to get a full set and then theyfigured out was $45 and I was like wellI'm in too deep so I have to get it nowbut like I was upset about it it'sreally cute that's one thing but like Imean $45 for a sports bra it's almostthe price of the leggings I feel likeit's a little much this collection comesin four colors this is the sea blue italso comes in a washed lavender yepwashed lavender burnt orange and black Ialmost got the orange but then like Ijust felt like this is really speakingto me and also it's a good time so acute color rage it's different fromtheir normal colors yeah the leggingsand sports rub both come to all thosecolors now let's talk about the leggingsspecifically so we won't talk aboutmaterial these are 95 percent nylon fivepercent elastic that's correct but theoriginal energy seam lessons I guess I'mjust gonna read my notes the originalenergy seamless our 69 percent nylon 17percent polyester and 14 percent lastingand the new energy seamless are 94percent nylon 6 percent blessing so ifyou're looking for like a materialthat's close to this the new energyseamless is basically like a percentageof material off difference from this butit does kind of feel different I haveboth of them right here and this so thisis the new energy seamless this is theflawless net and these are definitelylike a heavier the materials heavierit's thicker it's not as stretchy thematerial on a flawless net is super thinit's super thin so you need to know thatthere will be panty lines here no matterwhat you're going to wear so justsomething to keep in mybut it's definitely very thin and muchmore stretchy you could have see allthat stretch let's do the stretch testok these stretch too but it just feelslike you know it's a little lessstretchy so you're gonna get morecompression than energy seamless andmore stretch under the flawlessnessagain going off of that these I feltvery free to move so I like to likestretch at the end of my workouts whicheveryone should do but when I do thatsometimes I feel like with the energyseamless I don't know it like inespecially in the crotch area for somereason it feels very restricting in mymovements like when I'm trying tostretch I just I feel like at some pointlike fabric is gonna rip like hate tosay it but with these I just felt somuch more stretch and I didn't feel anyrestriction at all so if you have had anissue with you know restriction ofmovement in the gym truck energyseamless you won't get that in theflawless knit notice sizing so thesports for us and leggings both come insize extra small to large which could bea little more size inclusive but that'snot really the point of this um and Iwere small and I were small oneverything Jim shark and I'm 5 9 andthey are full-length on me so actuallyall Jim truck leggings are full-lengthon me so if you're tall they will befull lines but if you're short theymight be a little long so the waistbandI'm gonna insert a little clip of mecomparing them to the energy seamlessways focus so these are the energyseamless and these are the flawless netand the fabrics look about the same I'dsay I say the flawless and it feelssofter but what I'm really trying tocompare is the waistband because somepeople really hate the waistband of theenergy seamless and it's so much tall itlike it's a good like inch taller thanthe flawless knit as you can see but itis similar but I will have to say thisis very very thick this isn't as thickand it's a little more giving so you'regonna get more compression in an energyseamless and just like a little more Idon't know the less compression it'sjust less compression of these thewaistband is just it's so nice on thesefor the ombre seamless and the vitalseamless the waistband stretches out butthe waistband on the on these ones donot stretch out at all but they're notit's compression as the energy seemedmuch English I just had to say it muchso maybe that's I'm thinking but yeahit's shorter it's less compression butyou still do get some compressionbecause it is a double thickness offabric also it doesn't have the top andnone of the gym shark leggings really doit's like the dream ease but basicallythey are just a less compression shorterversion of the energy seamless waistbandand but it does go above my belly buttonor right about to my belly button whilethe energy seamless go a little higherthan that but although the waistbanddoesn't look very high on this there isa lot of space from like the crotch tothe waistband so they're still very highwaisted basically all Egyptian leggingsexcept for the Flex high oh I said sodon't worry about that but there is lesstummy compression so just note you couldsee a little I don't knowit's very spin in the area that youcould be carrying a little more weightso I could see that on set like I reallycarry a little weight in my stomach buton someone who does carry weight yourstomach I don't think these would be themost flattering because the waistband iskind of short and it kind of just likeeverything else below isn't compress ifyou know what I mean now I'm going to goover all the details the details are socute so this is like the little topdetailing comes right back to your buttactually will risque so you probablycan't wear like full coverage underwearif you're used to that and then it goesdown to more of like an energy seamlesskind of detailing and then on the otherside this is where the gym shark logowith which i think is such a cute littleplacement of the logo it's like veryunique and then it continues so these goall the way down but these I think thenyou get to these at the end which iskind of just like almost a fishnet thatlooks a little fishnet detailing andthey have these little eyelet detailingthat go all the way down to the bottomone thing you have to say is if you'rewearing underwear you can see the colorof the underwear through these littledots so I'd recommend wearing a nudepair of underwearand then they have they have a similarlittle shape to this and the energyseamless this is like just a littledetail except really a contour kindahard to explain on the back you can seethis goes up to the butt like we weresaying there is a thicker booty contourhere this is thicker than the energyseamless booty contour so it's a littlemore a little more prominent there thenthere was some little back of the kneeeyelets for a little you know back kneeventilation in case your knee pits aresweating here something and then on thebottom here is some more violetsanother little detail about the bootycontour right here at least on me do yousee it that's so so that's the bootycontour it did fall like two inchesunder my butt so like I don't reallywant to like hike the leggings upanymore cuz they're else we're gonna getlike total wedgie you know but the bootycontour doesn't fall exactly under thebooty and drip check has had a problemwith that look they don't like thatombre seamless booty contour is like inthe middle of my back like what you doin their bed is just kind of show thembut yeah basically be careful with thedetailing on these because it is verydelicate on my original energy seat letme show you on my original energyseamless I do have a run okay yeah doyou see that there is I have had I dohave a few runs from the eyelets becauseI don't know just like with with wearingthem it's kind of like when you have ahole in your your tights and it just itstarts running they kind of alreadystart the hole for you and then they canjust run so be very careful gettingthese on wash these in a laundered dogand make sure like no bra hooks get onthese or anything because these are verydelicate leggings and while the materialdoesn't pill the the little eyelets dokind of have a tendency to like I don'tknow rip a little bigger now for squadrudeness camel toe and the sweat proof Idid do a full workout in these so I willinsert a little video clips now butfirst squat crudeness I did check thesquat proof nest and I'd say they'reabout like an 8 out of 10 squat proof Ithink in like the lightingJim I don't think you'd ever notice itbut also because of the detailing uphere where you can see like an underwearcolor I just recommend wearing new tounderwear and if you do I don't thinkyou'll have any problems with thisbecause it is a darker shade of bluecamel tone I don't think I saw a ton ofcamel toe except me a little bit becausethese leggings are they're so thin thatlike you can see any lines like I waswearing like pretty seamless underwearyou could still kind of see a little bitof a line so it was a tiny bit of cameltoe but it wasn't like wow this is likegoing straight up you know I'm saying itwasn't like I was sweating a lot duringmy workout I kind of sweat a lot anywayso I was a good test for this test youknow but I didn't notice any likecollections of sweat or anything it waspretty good about the sweat proofI feel like inside somewhat same withthe sports bra I feel like just with allthe little detailing it kind ofdistracts many of that the guys eventhrough my workout they did hold up verywell I don't really have too manycomplaints over then it's delicate andnow after the sport throw so thematerial isn't the same as the leggingsand I do have to say they said it wasmedium high support I really expected alittle more out of it because it is ahigh neck I just didn't feel verysupported like I I don't know I feltalso like the it kind of a squish myboobs in a weird way I'll show you alittle clip it didn't I don't know theydidn't feel it wasn't quite there I Idon't know I clearly I don't know how todescribe it but it felt like a medium tolow support sports bra at least on me ifyou're a smaller chest go right aheadthis but I don't know also the past Idon't know one thing jump shark needs toinvest in it's better than betterremovable tabs because these are justthey're so flimsy like like come on likeI wish they would just like so paddinginto this it would look so much betterand I know I don't really lovedremovable pads cuz they like theyhonestly like right here look your boobtakes up like more space than that yourboob isn't just like a little oval youknow so I feel like it's not cute it'slike you well the support is medium lowit does have great coverage for a sportsbra it does feel like more of a crop topor like a high net crop it does go rightbelow the rib cage but the top goes tolike right about your neck and the backthe back is my favorite bar that's why Iordered it it's so cute it's this likedouble detail I don't know look and Iwas kind of hoping with all the strapsthat it would be like a little moresupport but it still wasn't the bestsupport but that's so cute guys it'slike such a unique back design don't youthink the sports bra also has veryminimal logos there's no logo at all onthe front there's just a simple littleshark on the back and I hope gym shirtcontinues this trend of kind of likeminimizing logos because I just thinklogo is kind of distract from the designso yeah very minimal logos just a littlebaby shark see yeah that's basically itI did really like the collection I'mdefinitely keeping them would I ordermore I don't think so but guys I found adupe that looked really similar to thesein Amazon and they ordered them for alittle review of that so that's all Ihave for you today guys I just thinkthese leggings are so unique and so doesa sports bra of course there are a fewlittle nitpicky things but I thinkoverall this is a great pair of leggingsand for a decent price not too high nottoo low a little too high for me he's alittle spoiled with my you know 15 to 20dollarsbut we'll see maybe I'll Express willhit us up with some of these anyway Ihope you guys enjoyed and of course letme know in the comments if there'sanything else you would like to see makesure to subscribe if you've made it thisfar probably say that in the videobecause who makes it this

prettygreat like I really love these I feltlike I was I walked in with the tube Iwas feeling myself like it was a thesemake me feel pretty good about myself Ireally love them they're so flatteringthe high waist is perfect they have lesscompression than an energy seamless theyare so soft and don't restrict yourmovements at all and I just I meanoverall my review of these is great Ilove them the collection has a sportsbra the leggings a long-sleeve crop topand a tank topso whatever amount of skin your you wantor don't want to show this set got youcovered but I had to say get one thingit's probably the leggings also in thetitle of this is like a non sponsoredreview and like I don't know why I wouldsay that because likeclearly not Egyptian athlete doesn't theonly sponsors but just thought I wouldmake it clear to you guys so first thinglet's talk about the prizes becausethat's the thing that we hate the mostabout this set the leggings were $55which is like okay like a normal pricefor leggings Lululemon leggings are like$100 so this is a seal you want tocompare to that but this works if youdon't know I just like you to guess howmuch a sports prizethere are times up it's $45 I'm reallywanted the sports bra and I knew Iwanted to get a full set and then theyfigured out was $45 and I was like wellI'm in too deep so I have to get it nowbut like I was upset about it it'sreally cute that's one thing but like Imean $45 for a sports bra it's almostthe price of the leggings I feel likeit's a little much this collection comesin four colors this is the sea blue italso comes in a washed lavender yepwashed lavender burnt orange and black Ialmost got the orange but then like Ijust felt like this is really speakingto me and also it's a good time so acute color rage it's different fromtheir normal colors yeah the leggingsand sports rub both come to all thosecolors now let's talk about the leggingsspecifically so we won't talk aboutmaterial these are 95 percent nylon fivepercent elastic that's correct but theoriginal energy seam lessons I guess I'mjust gonna read my notes the originalenergy seamless our 69 percent nylon 17percent polyester and 14 percent lastingand the new energy seamless are 94percent nylon 6 percent blessing so ifyou're looking for like a materialthat's close to this the new energyseamless is basically like a percentageof material off difference from this butit does kind of feel different I haveboth of them right here and this so thisis the new energy seamless this is theflawless net and these are definitelylike a heavier the materials heavierit's thicker it's not as stretchy thematerial on a flawless net is super thinit's super thin so you need to know thatthere will be panty lines here no matterwhat you're going to wear so justsomething to keep in mybut it's definitely very thin and muchmore stretchy you could have see allthat stretch let's do the stretch testok these stretch too but it just feelslike you know it's a little lessstretchy so you're gonna get morecompression than energy seamless andmore stretch under the flawlessnessagain going off of that these I feltvery free to move so I like to likestretch at the end of my workouts whicheveryone should do but when I do thatsometimes I feel like with the energyseamless I don't know it like inespecially in the crotch area for somereason it feels very restricting in mymovements like when I'm trying tostretch I just I feel like at some pointlike fabric is gonna rip like hate tosay it but with these I just felt somuch more stretch and I didn't feel anyrestriction at all so if you have had anissue with you know restriction ofmovement in the gym truck energyseamless you won't get that in theflawless knit notice sizing so thesports for us and leggings both come insize extra small to large which could bea little more size inclusive but that'snot really the point of this um and Iwere small and I were small oneverything Jim shark and I'm 5 9 andthey are full-length on me so actuallyall Jim truck leggings are full-lengthon me so if you're tall they will befull lines but if you're short theymight be a little long so the waistbandI'm gonna insert a little clip of mecomparing them to the energy seamlessways focus so these are the energyseamless and these are the flawless netand the fabrics look about the same I'dsay I say the flawless and it feelssofter but what I'm really trying tocompare is the waistband because somepeople really hate the waistband of theenergy seamless and it's so much tall itlike it's a good like inch taller thanthe flawless knit as you can see but itis similar but I will have to say thisis very very thick this isn't as thickand it's a little more giving so you'regonna get more compression in an energyseamless and just like a little more Idon't know the less compression it'sjust less compression of these thewaistband is just it's so nice on thesefor the ombre seamless and the vitalseamless the waistband stretches out butthe waistband on the on these ones donot stretch out at all but they're notit's compression as the energy seemedmuch English I just had to say it muchso maybe that's I'm thinking but yeahit's shorter it's less compression butyou still do get some compressionbecause it is a double thickness offabric also it doesn't have the top andnone of the gym shark leggings really doit's like the dream ease but basicallythey are just a less compression shorterversion of the energy seamless waistbandand but it does go above my belly buttonor right about to my belly button whilethe energy seamless go a little higherthan that but although the waistbanddoesn't look very high on this there isa lot of space from like the crotch tothe waistband so they're still very highwaisted basically all Egyptian leggingsexcept for the Flex high oh I said sodon't worry about that but there is lesstummy compression so just note you couldsee a little I don't knowit's very spin in the area that youcould be carrying a little more weightso I could see that on set like I reallycarry a little weight in my stomach buton someone who does carry weight yourstomach I don't think these would be themost flattering because the waistband iskind of short and it kind of just likeeverything else below isn't compress ifyou know what I mean now I'm going to goover all the details the details are socute so this is like the little topdetailing comes right back to your buttactually will risque so you probablycan't wear like full coverage underwearif you're used to that and then it goesdown to more of like an energy seamlesskind of detailing and then on the otherside this is where the gym shark logowith which i think is such a cute littleplacement of the logo it's like veryunique and then it continues so these goall the way down but these I think thenyou get to these at the end which iskind of just like almost a fishnet thatlooks a little fishnet detailing andthey have these little eyelet detailingthat go all the way down to the bottomone thing you have to say is if you'rewearing underwear you can see the colorof the underwear through these littledots so I'd recommend wearing a nudepair of underwearand then they have they have a similarlittle shape to this and the energyseamless this is like just a littledetail except really a contour kindahard to explain on the back you can seethis goes up to the butt like we weresaying there is a thicker booty contourhere this is thicker than the energyseamless booty contour so it's a littlemore a little more prominent there thenthere was some little back of the kneeeyelets for a little you know back kneeventilation in case your knee pits aresweating here something and then on thebottom here is some more violetsanother little detail about the bootycontour right here at least on me do yousee it that's so so that's the bootycontour it did fall like two inchesunder my butt so like I don't reallywant to like hike the leggings upanymore cuz they're else we're gonna getlike total wedgie you know but the bootycontour doesn't fall exactly under thebooty and drip check has had a problemwith that look they don't like thatombre seamless booty contour is like inthe middle of my back like what you doin their bed is just kind of show thembut yeah basically be careful with thedetailing on these because it is verydelicate on my original energy seat letme show you on my original energyseamless I do have a run okay yeah doyou see that there is I have had I dohave a few runs from the eyelets becauseI don't know just like with with wearingthem it's kind of like when you have ahole in your your tights and it just itstarts running they kind of alreadystart the hole for you and then they canjust run so be very careful gettingthese on wash these in a laundered dogand make sure like no bra hooks get onthese or anything because these are verydelicate leggings and while the materialdoesn't pill the the little eyelets dokind of have a tendency to like I don'tknow rip a little bigger now for squadrudeness camel toe and the sweat proof Idid do a full workout in these so I willinsert a little video clips now butfirst squat crudeness I did check thesquat proof nest and I'd say they'reabout like an 8 out of 10 squat proof Ithink in like the lightingJim I don't think you'd ever notice itbut also because of the detailing uphere where you can see like an underwearcolor I just recommend wearing new tounderwear and if you do I don't thinkyou'll have any problems with thisbecause it is a darker shade of bluecamel tone I don't think I saw a ton ofcamel toe except me a little bit becausethese leggings are they're so thin thatlike you can see any lines like I waswearing like pretty seamless underwearyou could still kind of see a little bitof a line so it was a tiny bit of cameltoe but it wasn't like wow this is likegoing straight up you know I'm saying itwasn't like I was sweating a lot duringmy workout I kind of sweat a lot anywayso I was a good test for this test youknow but I didn't notice any likecollections of sweat or anything it waspretty good about the sweat proofI feel like inside somewhat same withthe sports bra I feel like just with allthe little detailing it kind ofdistracts many of that the guys eventhrough my workout they did hold up verywell I don't really have too manycomplaints over then it's delicate andnow after the sport throw so thematerial isn't the same as the leggingsand I do have to say they said it wasmedium high support I really expected alittle more out of it because it is ahigh neck I just didn't feel verysupported like I I don't know I feltalso like the it kind of a squish myboobs in a weird way I'll show you alittle clip it didn't I don't know theydidn't feel it wasn't quite there I Idon't know I clearly I don't know how todescribe it but it felt like a medium tolow support sports bra at least on me ifyou're a smaller chest go right aheadthis but I don't know also the past Idon't know one thing jump shark needs toinvest in it's better than betterremovable tabs because these are justthey're so flimsy like like come on likeI wish they would just like so paddinginto this it would look so much betterand I know I don't really lovedremovable pads cuz they like theyhonestly like right here look your boobtakes up like more space than that yourboob isn't just like a little oval youknow so I feel like it's not cute it'slike you well the support is medium lowit does have great coverage for a sportsbra it does feel like more of a crop topor like a high net crop it does go rightbelow the rib cage but the top goes tolike right about your neck and the backthe back is my favorite bar that's why Iordered it it's so cute it's this likedouble detail I don't know look and Iwas kind of hoping with all the strapsthat it would be like a little moresupport but it still wasn't the bestsupport but that's so cute guys it'slike such a unique back design don't youthink the sports bra also has veryminimal logos there's no logo at all onthe front there's just a simple littleshark on the back and I hope gym shirtcontinues this trend of kind of likeminimizing logos because I just thinklogo is kind of distract from the designso yeah very minimal logos just a littlebaby shark see yeah that's basically itI did really like the collection I'mdefinitely keeping them would I ordermore I don't think so but guys I found adupe that looked really similar to thesein Amazon and they ordered them for alittle review of that so that's all Ihave for you today guys I just thinkthese leggings are so unique and so doesa sports bra of course there are a fewlittle nitpicky things but I thinkoverall this is a great pair of leggingsand for a decent price not too high nottoo low a little too high for me he's alittle spoiled with my you know 15 to 20dollarsbut we'll see maybe I'll Express willhit us up with some of these anyway Ihope you guys

[Music]what's up guys and welcome back to mychannel as you can see I just filmed theJimmy shark ultra seamless review so ifyou haven't seen that yet you probablywant to watch it because there's somegood stuff in there as normal Jim sharkfashion last week they launched theultra seamless collection which wassuper super hyped all the athletes werewearing it and then they launched likethree mystery collections that they justdidn't tell anyone about they launchedfeel lightweight seamless the movecollection in thief recess leggings thegym shark wasn't gonna fool me by tryingto put these under the same launchesUltra so I also got these so basicallythey were hi babies so let's see ifthere are any hidden gems so first I gottheir lightweight seamless leggingsthese leggings are fifty dollars andthey come in a lot of cool colors theycome in a black this kind of like steelblue kind of color a pistachio like neongreen similar to their vital seamlessand then like a little maroon plum shadeso these have a shorter waistband thansome other gym shark leggings but it'sstill a double thickness ribbedwaistband they have their logo justprinted right here just says Jim sharkthey have a little dot detailing downthe front on both sidesthis fabric definitely is that slickperformance material fabric and they doadvertise on their website that this islike a performance legging I don't knowif this is just on my leggings sometimesJim shark has this little like a raisedseam in the middle of the butt to kindof like separate the booty cheeks butlike mine kind of awkwardly stops itgoes on the middle then it kinda juststops at the bottom so I'm not reallysure what that's about he's definitely avery slick feel very breathable they'renot like super light so I expected themto be like a little more lightweight butthe fabric is decently thin and Jimshark has a disclaimer on these leggingssaying they may not appear fully squatproof at full depth so I guess I'mprobably not expecting these to be verysquat proof actually Jim sharks recentreleases have been like prettyconsistently squat proof except for thisguy but I'm kind of surprised that thisone isn't going to be because this feelslike pretty similar to some otherleggings they've come out with recentlyso I don't know policy okay honestlyreally like this okay I think these areprobably my favorite Jim shark leggingsthat I've launched all summer they areso stretchy literally look at all thatstretch they're super super lightweightyou know when you put your foot into apair of my gameand they're just like so much give tothem it's super super lightweight that'sthese they feel so good and like theseare a perfect summer legging they don'tmake you feel too hot at all sincethey're so lightweight you are gonnahave some risk for like panty lines andit probably isn't the most cellulitefriendly in the world it's actuallydecently fluttering on the bud it's justa classic seamless legging it's notgonna squish your butt down thewaistband actually has a lot ofcompression to it so it is a shorterwaistband so it's not going to becompressive like all the way down yourbelly so it doesn't have like a lot oflower tummy control but it has a lot ofcontrol in actual waistband I think thelittle dot design is really cute it justis very little lightweight and airy Idon't know this just makes sense thatit's called like a lightweight seamlessbecause that's really what it feels likeso yeah I'm not getting any camel toeyou can't see the gusset crotch itactually isn't really restrictive at allI'm feeling like I can move like a lotin these okay yeah definitely favoriteJewish arc leggings of the summer I'mreally obsessed these yeah they have alot of really cute colors oh my goshthese are so stretchyI'd give these like a medium to high onthe booty scale because they have areally compressive waistband by the waythis waistband is not going to stretchout at all and it just like it makes mefeel so like I don't know snatched I'mobsessedand you guys know that I'm very criticalof Jim shark so honestly these areamazingNemo approves[Music]okay then I got the lightweight seamlesscrop top which actually feels likenothing at all I really like this Ithink this is really cool so this isonly $30 which is honestly superaffordable it has kind of the samelittle like Airy lightweight detailingand the jimtran logo is so subtle but Ihonestly think that's really cute itjust is kind of like in the fabric nostick on or anything I really like thatactually this shirt actually house likea little drawstring at the bottom so youcan kind of like make the shirt likecuff in a little bit which makes it kindof have like a little black see fit theback has this kind of like perforateddetailing at the top that you can'treally tell but it's very verylightweight you can see like some lightthrough it because I think this is likereally cute and lightweight so let's seeit here's the top it's definitely like adifferent kind of design but I thinkit's nice if you're not looking for likea really tight crop top superlightweight and airy it feels like I'mhonestly wearing nothing I like that youcan tighten this because sometimes ifyou have like a really loose shirt and Ilook you do like a yoga position orsomething it can like come up but if youhave this you can kind of like tightenit and then it stays on really nicely Ilove the little details I think theseare super super cute I also like thatthese are like kind of more neutralcolors it kind of has a little dropsleeve so it's not gonna cut into yourarmpits at all it has a pretty high neckbut it's not cutting into my neck andmaking it uncomfortable yeah I reallyhave no issues with this top it'sdefinitely not like everyone's cup oftea like I don't know how flatteringthis shape is going to be on everyone Idon't think they have a sports bra forthis collection but they had like a lotof other like little top options[Music]next we have the new leggings which are$45 and honestly I just picked these upand these are like really really softI'm super impressed I just looked at theback and like I really I'm so tired ofthis monkey but detailing like I don't Idon't need this like do you see that ithas the widow's peak thing the linkbelow but Schwartz detail this is likemy least favorite thing that Jim sharksbeen doing lately like why are you doingthis why do you have the seam into thebutt for people with big butts oh it'sgonna go in the middle of your butt sothat's not cute I don't know but thefabric is honestly really good thefabric is like a slick performancematerial but almost like buttery soft soyeah if you're into like super seamedleggings these could be for you I guessand even says in the website that theyhave like a double panel detailing onthe buttI'm already kind of noticing so I likejust took these out of the bag and Ifeel like mine are like slightly likedamaged like I literally just took themout of the bag you guys saw these we'reall in the bag and I don't know if youcan tell but there's like a lot oflittle like fuzzy detailing which Iwouldn't expect from this fabric butit's like here the logo is actuallyreally cool it's made of like thislittle like rubberized stuff so I thinkthat's like much more high quality thanthe vinyl they usually like stick onthere's some mesh panel detailing downthe sides and yeah overall I think Ilike the fabric of this lighting I justfeel like they're trying to do a lotwith these like booty contours seemslately they just aren't the same alsothis kind of doesn't look like entirelysymmetric like this is the point andthen it kind of like goes to the side ifyou see like it kind of like swerves soI don't know okay so here are the moveleggings and I have to say these arehonestly really really stretchy too thisfabric is super unique so these leggingsare super super buttery soft but at thesame time they're like a performancelike material they do have a seam at thetop of the waistband and it's cutting ita little bit but like not too bad it hasa front seam but I don't really thinkit's giving me any Campbell Chado Ithink these little mesh details arepretty cute they add like a little Idon't know extra element to the leggingsand one thing I have to say is that thewaistband is like pretty small it waskind of hard to get over my hip regionbut now that it's on my waist if it'sreally well here's the butt I justI really don't like all these seams it'skind of like a personal preferencethough if you like it or not I don'tlike that they put a double thicknessover the butt region because like yeah Ican feel like two distinct layers offabric like I'm just grabbing the toplayer right now and I just feel like itsquishes my butt down so I wouldn't givethese like very high on the booty scaleprobably do like medium to low on thebooty scale just because I feel likeit's like the extra fabric it's justkind of squishing it down and I look forlike I wanted to flatter my butt notwatching my butt if you know I'm sayingso um yeah not my favorite theseprobably wouldn't be the most cellulitefriendly because they are pretty thinbut yeah these are just okay for me likeI don't think I would recommend them topeople unless you really like likeperformance material leggings and like alot of seams and stuff but they're justlike not my personal favorite[Music]then we have the move Sportsgirl whichis $35 and I'm kind of surprised theylabel this is a light support sports brawell like this one is medium support andI like would not expect that becausethis honestly looks like decently likegood coverage and like a pretty thickcompressive fabric it has a little meshlittle v in the front to match thelittle mesh panel of the leggings um ithas the matching like rubberized logoand these straps kind of converge into aY back which is cute yeah that'sbasically it on the sports bra it'snothing special but it looks like a nicebasic kind of like performance materialsports bra yeah and here's the sportsbra I actually really like this little Bdetailing it makes it like a little morelike I don't know feminine of a shapethan just the straight across I wouldactually call this bra and mediumsupport they call it a light support onthe website but I would definitely saythis there's no like distinct band youcan see on the outside it looks seamlessbut they actually do have like a prettythick elastic in the sports bra so itactually does really stay down on yourribcage and then it has a little teeback which is nice especially for likean back or shoulder day you definitelyhave like a lot of room back there towork so yeah I think this is a prettysolid sports bra I definitely think myfavorite thing about the move collectionis the fabric I think it's really reallyunique I just don't like all the seamsand everything but I actually reallylike the sports bra and then I got theirrecess leggings so one weird thing aboutthis oh no where did I go the back Idon't know if anyone else is noticed buton the gym shirt website they'll saylike a really simple name for a colorand then on the back because theyusually have like a more intricate namebut this one leggings have a totaldifferent name on their website this issupposed to be the rhesus leggingscollection this is supposed to be therecess like a collection I think I keepsaying rhesus like that's the peanutbutter cup on the bag it says urbanleggings so these have a completelydifferent name on the bag then on thewebsite just like why are theyconsistent also I bought this in thecolor pink and on this bag it sayspastel grape Jim shark which one is itmake up your mind Ilike I get confused because like theyall have different names and then like Ithink I order one color and then thename on the package says something elseit's just weird I just think that's likekind of a strange like strategy I don'tknow okay I think that these leggingsare supposed to be kind of like they saythat they're like a before and aftercollection and I think they're trying toemphasize that they can be for lounge orgym I definitely feel like they're moreof a lounge material they have that likekind of brushed cottony texture sodefinitely not like a select performancematerial at all they have a little V inthe front which usually is prettyflattering because it kind of comes uphigher on the sides it has a high waistin the back and it has this like verybold like gym sharp in the back which Ikind of feel like it's weird because thegym shirt is straight but then like thislittle widow's peak detailing kind ofgoes down so I don't know it feels likea little weird to me yeah and this gymshark thing is just like a vinylattached so I would have to be carefulif you did wash these leggings you wouldhave to turn them inside out and makesure that that doesn't like come offthey have more little like tiny gymshark detailing on the side above thepockets they also have pockets but yeahthese are definitely less panel than thelast ones which I appreciate becausesometimes gym shirt goes a littleoverboard on the paneling these areplenty like more of a lounge liking theylook like they're gonna be prettycompressive it kind of feels like thesame material as their Legacy Collectionthat just launched which I actuallydidn't love so we'll see if these areslightly less compressive maybe fit alittle better okay and here are therecess leggings I don't feel like theyfit me like super well I feel like theyfit around the waistband there's alittle extra space in this region thefabric definitely doesn't have as muchstretch as either of the other leggingswe talked about today I like that theyhave some of these like unique littledesigns I love nice legging with pocketsI think that if you really like a lot ofgym shark lo going this is really cuteyeah I definitely would consider thismore of a lounge legging just because ofthe soft brush material I think thatthis is probably cover up cellulitepretty well because it is pretty thickand compressive um I'd probably give ita low on the booty scale I just likedon't really think they're doing muchfor my butt they just kind of gostraight over it and don't really give alot of separation either so yeah theseare just okay for me they really feel alot like the legacysection ones except less paneling and Idon't know I think I liked that like itscene was a little better even though Iactually didn't really like those I justdon't feel like these like I feel likethese ones like keep falling down thewaist thing it doesn't really have likea lot of elasticity to it so don'treally feel like it's like being held upvery nicely but when it's pulled up itactually goes a decent over your butt sothat's actually pretty flattering soyeah don't love these but they're okay[Music]all right so that's all of the newcollections that launched with the Jibshark ultra seamless if I had to choosea one thing from this collection itwould be those lightweight seamlessleggings those pallet was so good I lovethem so much I want them in all thecolors to be honest they snatch yourwaist they make your butt look nicethey're lightweight they give you roomto move aroundthere's just through where the flawseverything else is just ok for me it wasa little too much like seam egde actionalright if you guys like these honestteach'em shark reviews please

Lightweight Seamless, Move, and Recess Collection Review!",1NS0_LCYsgo,62522
so before we get into the review i justhave to rant for a minute my review isstill going to be very objective asalwaysbut you'll probably relate to this rantif you've ever shopped a popular gymshark launchif you're new here my name is catherineand we do a lot of brutally honestreviewsthis was supposed to be a review of thegymshark soul lift collection butunfortunatelyone minute and 30 seconds into thelaunch everything sold out in my cartso we have some of the soul lift stuffbut we also have some of the adventurecollectionso we got a little mix so i've beenshopping from gym shark for years andthey love to hype up stuffand then sell out very quickly and iti feel like it's getting worse i used tobe able to have like a solid fiveminutes to shop before things soldout and i literally tried to buy thisstuff anda minute and 30 seconds in it was allgone for my cartso i ended up with one pair of soul liftleggings i waited in my car for 15minutes to make sure that i was going tobe able to get on this launchthe exact second it launched and i stillwasn't able to get everything that iwanted so i literally don't know howmany more gym shark reviews i'm going tobe able to doi'd say this is my last one but i gettoo many requests tonot do it so i'm just going to have tobe faster i guess so the soul liftcollectionthis was incredibly hyped up which idon't really quite understand i'll getto that in a minute but not only didthey haveall of their athletes promote this butthey also sent these out to a bunch ofother influencersthey sent them to suzy kb to hope scopeto a bunch of other influencerswhich they don't do for every launchusually it's just the athletes so you'regoing to hype this up so much andpretend like it's an accident that yousold out this quicklyi'm just really starting to get tired ofthis hype it up sell out immediatelything that gymshark does and honestlythis was kind of the last straw for mewe dealt with it for the whitney simmonscollectionit was a mess then i didn't shop forseveral months because i was tired of itand then this collection was so hyped upi thought i have to try it and then icouldn't even get anythingit's been a while since p just appearedin the video what do you see she likesto watch the birds i just got her a birdfeeder and she's a big fanso anyways i get on the side exactly atthe time i have everything in my carti'm ready to goa minute and 30 seconds in i refresh andthe yellow set is gone for my cart andthen i quickly go to check out and bythe time i check out the pink set isgone for my card and then i go back tomaybe get like the blue or something andthenevery single thing is sold out by thetime i go so then i end up with zerosports bras in zero shortsand don't get me wrong gymshark iscertainly not the only brand to sell outvery quickly but usually other brandslike kind of do something about it tomake sure their customers can get whatthey wantbuff bunny recently sold out veryquickly of their live collectionand then the same day literally 20minutes later announced that they justplaced a rush order to restock in thenext two monthsbalance sold out of their recent oasislaunch but then they made a pre-salei don't necessarily agree with payingupfront for a pair of leggings you'renot gonna getfor three months but at least it's anoption so let's say you were workingwhile the launch was happening whichisn't surprising considering it wasduring the business hours in the unitedstatesyou have no hope you're not getting theshorts they are all gone so now i justwant to rant a little bit of like whythese were hypedbecause i don't know if i'm the only onebut when i first saw the shorts andeverything i really wasn't impressedi think gymshark makes a lot of reallygreat seamless stuff i love theirlightweight seamless i love their camobut their other collections like theirdreamy collection and things with seamsand just kind of basic looking stuffalways kind of fall short for me likethe dreamies were really thick not verystretchy and didn't fit me very welli also wasn't impressed with theirtraining leggings and i saw so manyphotos and reviews from peoplewhen you could see the tag through theshorts while these people were standingso just think how bad these are gonna bewhen you're actually like leaning oversquatting and working out sounfortunately we only got the leggingsto reviewand sometimes i just don't think it'sreally fair to the athletes when youliterally only have about 30 seconds toshop for a launch who's gonna go out oftheir way to click on someone's specificlink in their bioto shop through them there's too littletime to do that like a code is one thingyou just kind of enter it out atcheckout but a link you have likeload that and like go through all thatstuff so i don't know and i'm just kindof over brains creating this falsescarcityit really doesn't hype up their productsanymore to me it just makes me upset andit just makes me not even want to tryand wait for the aliexpress dupesinsteadall right rant over let's get into thereview so first we did get the soul liftleggings in the light blue colorand these were 45 which isn't too badfor gym shark leggings their leggings goup to like 60 or 65 so it's kind of onthe lower end so these kind of aren'twhat i was expecting i didn't know thatthe waistband was going to be ribbedlike thisso it's kind of like a seamless materialribbed waistband which doesn't really gowith the rest of the fabric if you askme the rest is kind of just theirclassicmarled material it's actually prettysoft but it's not brushed and you cantell it's definitely very very thin sodefinitely not in love with thiswaistbandit also has a seam at the top which idon't know why every single other brandcan make leggingswith seamless waistbands but gymsharkjust will not they are seamless in thefront so no front seam no camel they dohave slightly curved seams around theglutes but i feel like any liftingeffect this would have is kind of takenawayby the flat seam that's like right aboveit they have a very slight scrunchdetailside pockets and then the part that idon't really understand at the bottomthey have what they call theselaser-cut eyelets and i just don'treally see the point of these and theykind of look like those cheap littlelikecircles you used to put around yourthree-hole punch paperto like reinforce them so they didn'trip you know what i'm talking about ijust i could have done without thiswhole situation i don't think it looksvery good so this collection wassupposed to be inspired by summer on thewest coasti kind of thought there'd be somethingin the description about how these aregood like lifting leggingsbecause it's like the soul liftcollection but it doesn't say anythingabout thatthese don't really feel like they'regoing to be super performance liftingleggings don't really understand thenamethey do just have a simple crotch gussetand i already have a little stringcoming out of the front we love to seethat i pulled it and honestly kind ofmade it worse so i need to just cut thisoff i guessall right so here are the soul liftleggings and we definitely have somepros and cons so first let's go over thefabricthe fabric is better than i thought iwouldn't say it's compressive but i dofeellike it's kind of holding me in in theright places it's very stretchyand very form-fitting so i don't feellike it's like loose or gatheringanywhereit kind of feels like a softer versionof the vital seamless with a little morehold to themi definitely prefer the fabric to thevital seamless because sometimes thevitals can be like a little bit scratchylike not very soft these are definitelypretty soft it's not brushedso it shouldn't really pill i feel likethis could be an okay performancelegging it's not screaming performanceto mebut i don't think they're gonna be likesomething that's gonna ruin very easilyall around it's a pretty lightcompression the waist is really notgiving me much compression at alland i'm just really not a fan of thiswaistband i don't understandi actually like the body of the leggingso i don't know why they just didn'tmake that into the waistband i don'treally understand why it's this kind oflike ribbedkind of like sweatpant like material idon't like a little band at the top it'snot really doing anything for meand the whole waistband itself is reallynot offering me any compressionso i don't know they had me up to thewaistband the no friend theme is nicei'm not gettinga camel or gathering if you're inbetween sizes i'd size downjust because they are very stretchy andthe waistband just has like a littleextra space for me i don't knoweverything fits well up to the waistbandso they do have little pockets and itdoesfit my phone like kind of not like allthe way they're not like super deeppockets but that definitely would likehold it ini feel like this is kind of weirdplacement for the logo like usually theyput it like here and it's kind of likefacing backwards likeon the pocket i don't know what's goingon with that so like i said with thefabric it does kind of like hugeverything really well so i do actuallythink these are pretty flattering on theglutes i don't really know if that wasa booty scrunch before or what because idon't feel like there's any sort ofscrunch nowi do feel like it separates the glutes alittle bit and i definitely seethis little like curved seam coming intoaction but i don't really know wherethat little scrunch went maybe i justmade that upi do like the curved seams but gymsharkalways has to have a curved seam andthen a flat seam above it and it justkind of like negates the effect of thecurved seam i don't know and i do feellike you can see the tagthrough the leggings again not a fan ofthese could definitely have done withoutthey are about a 7 8 length and i don'tthink you'd get a lot of cellulitecoverage out of these because they arepretty thinand i think i'd give them a medium tohigh on the booty scale because they'reactually pretty nice so i actually likethem more than i thought but i wouldn'tkeep them just because i don't like thiswaistband at all they got rid of thiswaistbandthey'd actually be some pretty nice[Music]leggingsthen i got the soul lift tank in steelblue and this is forty dollars so it'sonly five dollars cheaper than theleggingsand i personally don't think it's worththat i think the leggings are a goodprice but forty dollars for like a tanktopso it has a high neck and then it hasone of those like heat sealed be avisionarylogos this does feel like it's going tostay on more than some of their logos ifeel like their logos often just likefall off this one does feel like it's inthe fabric a little morei expected the fabric to be the same asthe leggings but it's actually totallydifferent it's this literally paper thinshiny performance material fabric it'sgot these kind of long cut out sleevesand it's a raw cut edgeso there's no like hemming on the edgeit's literally just a raw cutand i just feel like it's gonna likeliterally stretch out like i canliterally pull itand it's like already kind of comingapart a little bit i don't think theyshowed it on the raw edge butmore of the lovely reinforcement holesthey also have some mesh panel detailingso this does seem like a verylightweight tank i will say thatin the tank is a nylon elastane materiali got it a size mediumlet's try it on all right so here's thetop definitely super lightweight thisfabric is literally paper thini really don't like the raw cut edgebecause i feel like i can just pull itand it's coming apart i don't like itthe overall shape i think is nice i dolike the high neck the front is almostkind of cropped it goes like right tothe top of my leggings and i think formost people it would go over yourleggings i have a very long torsoit does scoop a decent amount around thearmpits so if you're wearing a braunderneath it'll probably show i'm not afan of thesenot they also have that little meshstreak in the back the whole fabric isbreathable so i don't really know whythey needed to add mesh but they didand the tank top's okay i just don'tthink i'd spend 40 on it it's just notanything that's like super impressiveso yeah this is a medium and i thinkthat the top is supposed to be kind of arelaxed fit so i do thinktrue to size size up depending on whatyou want but i think the medium is finefor meand then we got the soul lift super cropthis was only 30so i feel like their pricing is kind ofall over the place because i think 30is fine for this is essentially sleevesbut but the tank is 40so i don't really understand that andyet another different material usuallywhen i think of a collection i feel likethe materials are all going to be thesamebut this is like just a classicsweatshirt material it's actually likesuper soft it has that like really fuzzysweatshirt material on the inside so ithas the same little like heat seallogo and then it's just a sweatshirtmaterial with the superfuzzy brushed soft inside and i wishthey just madea regular cropped sweatshirt i've neverseen someone seriously wearthis kind of above the boob crop thing idon't understandwhy this is a style i'm never gonna belike oh my entire torsoshe's fine she's not cold my arms verycold leave a comment down below ifyou've ever seen someone actually likeand wear these because i would love toknow like no judgment i just want toknowall right so here's this thing for somepros first i do like these little cuffedsleevesthey're actually very long and they goover my wrists a little bit so i alwayslike when they're like long enough slashgo over my wrists a tiny bitit's definitely a super plush softsweatshirt material and that's where weend the pros i just don't reallyunderstandwhen i wear this also with someone witha chest i just feel like this is likeheyi wanted to wear sleeves but i alsowanted to show off my cleavagei just feel very uncomfortable with thisi'm not a fan and i just think it'd be alot cuter if it's justa cropped sweatshirt i'm not really intocropped sweatshirts that much to beginwith so i'm really not into thesupercroftanyways i just kind of got this for funbecause i thought it was sillyso that's it for the soul lift stuff andnow we have some of the adventurecollectioni had to try these venture joggersbecause they look like work pants to meand i don't know maybe jump shark isexpanding into that lululemon makes likelifestyle likework clothes-ish stuff too i think sowhy not these are the adventure joggersin black so these are 50which is kind of the normal price forgym shark bottoms and i'm surprised whythey call them joggers because they kindof just look like work pants to me idon't know slackswould you say they have these two littlebuttons in the front they do say they'rea high rise which i think a lot of likework style pants like thisare often like a mid to low risetherefore i hate them so these mightactually be kind of nice the only thingi'm worried is they're gonna be kind ofshort i know it's like a european thingto wear likecropped pants all the time and like notcare if your pants like aren't longenough but likei like my pants to be to my ankles sothey say they're a high rise and thatthey're an extra high rise to the backso they do go up a little more in theback which is great because sometimeswhen you lean overthe pants come down a little bit so thatwas that's a good thought so i'm readingthe website right now and it says it'san adjustableergonomic waistband i've never heard theword ergonomic used for clothing i'veonly heard it for like chairswhat does ergonomic even mean all rightso ergonomic means designed forefficiencyand comfort in the working environmentso these are work pantsokay what else does the website sayabout these the venture joggers havebeen created specifically with thecommuter in mindokay they feature an extra high-risewaistband in the back for cyclingso european and ergonomic shaping to theleg i guess these are for like peoplewho like bike to workwhich is a really good idea honestly alot of people do that it's not a veryamerican thing butgypshark's a uk brand so interestingthey also have this like adjustable typewaistband with like these littledrawstring cords they do have a littlereflective logoon the back i'm surprised how much it'sshowing up on camera actually you can'treallysee it very much on the thing but it'ssupposed to be reflective i guess againforbiking and then they have this strangekind of like velcro adjustable thing onthe ankle i guess you can make it alittle tighter on your ankles these arevery weird but i'm not opposed so let'stry them onokay so i'm gonna try my best to reviewthese but i don't really know how toreview pants like thisso i did get a size small and i'd say itfits pretty well it does have a doublebutton thing and a full zipbut i did have to tighten these littleguys a little bit even though i had toadjust them a little bit i don't feellike it's poofing out like sometimesadjustable waist things can do they'redefinitely a super high waist which i dolove i don't have any like work pantsthat are super high waisted like thisthey actually have a little hidden legpocket that oh actually it's a vent okayactually it might be a pocket slash beni don't really knowso they're a nice matte fabric my onlything is i don't love fabrics that likesound like thisi just feel like it gets kind ofannoying throughout the day and mythighs are gonna rub together so anytimei walk anywherewe're gonna hear that we're gonna knowshe's coming they have two fairly deeppockets in the front they actually golikepretty far down which women's pocketsare usually not great so i will givethem that that's pretty good i feel likethey look okay in the back i'm not sureif they're really doing much for my buttbut like they arework pants and i will say that most workpants never look good on me so iwouldn't judge this too muchbecause i just feel like my legs lookhorrible in the style pant but i justfeel like they get kind of awkward atthe bottomi don't really like how when you tightenthis they have like this random likeloose fabric at the endbecause like how can you really tightenthe bottom of pants by just putting astrap around it and like i thought theyare too short on me so i think they looka little sillyon my height so i think they're okay ido like that they're really stretchy idon't really love this little weirdbottom situation soand lastly we have the venture leggingswhich are 55so they're definitely the most expensiveones of the bunch so they're a high riseand they actually comeup in the back again the website saysthis is supposed to be one of their mostluxurious fabrics ever and i just likeam not feeling like the luxury feel fromthesethe design is just a little strange tome i like that the waistband comes downin the front that should give a littleextra tummy control but it's literallyjust this little square of waistbandthey actually don't have like a realwaistband in the back they have a littleband at the top which can kind of cut inand i'm not really a huge fan of theydon't really have an official waistbandwhich is kind of strange but i'm notagainst it now that i'm feeling them iactually do see what they mean by theluxury fabricthey kind of remind me of a lululemonlux stream like their fast and free pantit's that slick performance material butit's not looking cheap and shinythis fabric is that thick enough fabricthat you can have that raw cut edge andit actually holds up they have some nicelittle mesh pocketsgusset crotch i feel like they reallywould have won me on these if they hadlike an official waistband in the backand perhaps a seamless waistbandi just i don't really know how this isgonna look since these are that slickperformance material they're gonna begood for things that your like legs willrub together like running i think theseare also made for cyclingso without further ado let's try them onall right so here are the adventureleggings they were definitely a struggleto get onthey feel really tight on my thighs herebut then i don't feel like i'm actuallygetting any waist compression they dohave this little likemini v waistband rectangle thing rightherewhich gives you a little bit of lowertummy control but i just really missthat overall waistband compression and idon't think these are like holding me upvery well in the backi just kind of want it to be tight allthe way around so i'm not really a fanof this whole like no waistbandsituation they're super slickperformance material i would say they'resimilar to the lululemon fast and freeluck stream i think it is i do feel alittle bit of restriction in the knees idon't know if that's because these are alittle bit small on me this is my normalgym shark sizeor if they just don't really have a lotof stretch to them but i would havepreferred a little more stretch in theknees especially since these are likebiking pants i would expect them to havelike a little moremovement in the knees this is mepretending to bike they're actuallylonger than most gym shark leggings i'dsay they're almost at full length thewaistband has a little band seam at thetop which i just don't like thati'd say they're about a medium to highcompression especially just sincethey're so tight in the thighs thewaistband i just give a mediumcompression though because there reallyis no waistband to compressi'd say true to size slash size up ifyou're in between are unsurei do feel like they'd be good forperformance since they are very slickand your legs just kind of slide rightalong each otheri think i just give these like a mediumon the booty scale they're not reallydoing much they don't really haveanything to enhancebut they're not really squishing me downand probably cellulite friendly not solike proof they are pretty compressivebut they're also kind of thin they'reokay i think i'd like them a lot more ifthey had a little more stretch and likea true waistband but the fabric'sactually pretty nice okay after doingthe squat test i felt like they kind ofwanted to like fall down during thesquat because i don't really haveanything holding them up in the backso keep it in mind[Music]all right so that is it for the review idon't think i 100 lovedeverything but there were definitelythings that i liked more than expected ihave to say i'm not too bummed aboutmissing the sole lift shorts now becausei just really didn't like that waistbandwhy don't they just make the waistbandout of the legging material likeeveryone else doesso we'll see if they ever bring theseback in stock comment down below if youwere able to snag any of these and whatyour thoughts arealso feel free to leave any

[Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music]hey guys and welcome back to my channelso for this video I ordered all of theflawless knit colors will all of the newfall estate colors so recently Jim sharkhas been doing a lot of new launchesthat aren't necessarily like new designsbut they have a lot of new colors sothey recently launched this yellowflawless net the Ruby and the khakiwhich is more of an olive green to mebut apparently it's called khakiI always thought Kathy was that tancolor like my the only one anyways I dida review of the original flawless knitcolors a while back I only had the blueone at that point but this time Ithought I would order all of them so Icould like really tell you guys like ifthey all feel the same if they're allsquat proof they're not and if like anycolors are more stiff than the othersalso this is the first video in a whilethat I don't have tape on my forehead alot of people were confused about thetape even though I did mention it in avideo but I had like surgery on myforehead and I had like it's tapedpreserved scar for a while but now Iwent back and my face is untapedso yeah also this video is on sponsoredI am NOT a gym truck athlete boughtthese with my own money and unlike mostof their views which are sponsored I'mactually going to be completely totallyhonest with you guys on my opinions onthis so yeah I only got the leggings butthey also have I believe sports braslong sleeve cropped topszip up jackets and tank tops so there'slike a whole range but I thought likethe leggings are like the mostcontroversial thing to get because likewith like issues like squat grew fromcamel toe so the leggings are $55 andthey come in other colors but again thenew colors are the yellow the khaki andthe beet and the material is the exactsame as the last colors it's 95% nylonand 5% elastane and to a touch they feellike the energy seamless but there are alot thinner and a lot more stretchy soif you thought that energy seamless werevery thick and like compressive theseare very thin don'tthey offer any compression and are veryvery stretchy so you're a lot more freeto move than in the energy seamless Ipersonally like these better than theenergy seamless and the waistband alittle more flattering - in my opinionso these do run true to size I wear sizesmall and my measurements are down belowand they are full-length on me and I'mfive nine they have size extra small tolarge for the waistband it hits me rightabove my belly button and it offers alot less compression than the energyseamless waistband is also a lot shorterbut it doesn't stretch out at all I havean issue with like things like the ombreseamless and the vital seamlessstretching out over time in the waistand I have not had an issue of theseI've been wearing my blue flawless knitfor about like two to three months nowand they've totally held up and I thinkoverall the waist the waistband is veryflattering and kits in a very flatteringarea and it's not like too high and ithits like above the like love-handleregion so it's not gonna like squeezeyou in and like awkward places if youknow what I mean and if you want to seelike a full in-depth like view of allthe details I have that in my lastfelissa video that I will link downbelow but again there's just a lot ofvery delicate eyelets in this design allover the legging so you need to be verycareful with getting these leggings onespecially if you have nails becausethey can kind of like stick into theholes and grip them also be careful ifyou use a lot of resistance bands Idon't wear the flawlessness on leg daysbecause I like to use a big thick hipcircle resistance band and when you usethat on these like kind of eyelets ifyou kind of like fuzz them up a littlebit and like I don't know it makes themrun and it just like doesn't hold upvery well so I would recommend usingthese on days you're going to be usingresistance bands and also just be verycareful in general and handling needsand like the wash because they are supersuper delicate now I'm going to be goingover each of the colors and like yourspot purpose and how they feel andcompared to the other colors - first ofall the yellow which I feel like is likethe most desirable color from thiscollection just because it's like sobright and fun I feel like a lot ofit's really hyped this one up but beforeyou go behind this these are the most c3leggings I've ever worn in my entirelife like I have ordered $5 leggingsfrom Aliexpress that have more coveragethan these like you can see I'm going toinsert Clips you can see the shadow oflike my like booty crack while I'mstanding up straight like not evensquatting so it's not even that thesearen't squat proof but these aren't evenlike stand proof and like even if youdon't do these on a leg day which Ialready put it if you're doing thatupper body days you still have to leanover and pick up weights and these areso sheer that you would be literallyflashing everyone even if you're doinglike a hit circuit or something that seewhat the Simmons doing in these youyou're kind of like squatting over likegoing up and down like these are notsafe for any kind of exercise that youdo or even everyday like you have tolean over it like be they're so sheer Igive these like a zero out of tensquawkers in Robin gallant who's a gymsock athlete and one of her reviews saidthere were 70% squat groups and that'sjust like the most BS thing I've everheard like 70% squat group leggingswould be totally like appropriate for meto still wear to the gym like if mygames are completely scot-free fromusually fine but like I would not wearthese like these these are definitely ahundred percent going back to gym sharklike seriously jump shark you need tostep up your game you can't makeleggings this year okay so now that Ifully ranted about how upset I am abouthow charities are let's go on to some ofthe other points so for camel toebecause this kind of material so thinand also this color is so light you areat risk for some kale toe especiallysingle camel but I have like almost alittle bit of double Campbell evenwithout the seam but I feel like that'ssomewhat due to like your Anatomy aswell but like if you normally have anissue with camel toe and leggings youprobably will have it with these two andthe cellulite actually wasn't as bad asI thought because they have like thislittle under bootie contour you can'treally see it but it's just like a verylight contouring it kind of addsit kind of like hides a little bit ofthe cellulite so I really didn't thinkit was awful especially given how thinand like light color these are I thinkyour cellulite they're actually likedecently okay yeah and these fit reallywell like size small was perfectand they were just as stretchy as allthe other colors one more thing I wantto note is that the crotch seams are alittle stiff and I have this issue witha lot of trip shark leggings but therest of the leggings are super stretchybut the crotch seams don't really have alot of give to them as you can see soit's kind of difficult to like lift yourleg up and squat a little bit I reallykind of heard some like seam noiseswhile I was squatting that was a littleconcerning but yeah definitelywish that oh my gosh they already havelike a scene coming up serious guys Iliterally just wore these to try on andthat's it you see that seam hey Jimshark qualities you really gone downhillthat's really disappointing okay well Iguess I was right about hearing someseam noises like I should be able tosquat it's the whole point of Jim myname's okay now the other colorsdefinitely did a lot better squatFitness I get the khaki at nine out often squat proof you still have a littlecamel toe kind of like the yellow ones asimilar issue with cellulite or similarlike situation with cellulite as theyellow ones I didn't really see much andthese were also super stretchy just likethe yellow ones and fit perfectly andthe beet ones so these the colors beetbut they're almost like they're almostblack like they're super dark so thesewere definitely spot proof I'd also givethem a 9 out of 10 just because likewith my big ring light you can see likethe tiniest bit of like I don't knowkind of sheared out a little bit but youcouldn't see any underwear or any or anycheeks or anything so we're all coveredso if you want to squat for yourflawlessness these these are good and Ididn't really have an issue with cameltoe or cellulite because they're just sodark you really can't even see anythingso it's not even an issuethese also fit like there was no extramaterial anywhere I found with darkercolors that I think like something inthe dye makes them a little more stiffbecause these definitely werelittle tighter to get on they feltalmost like the energy seamless likethat kind of tight like compressivefeeling so these definitely aren't asstretchy as these two colors so justkeep that in mind if you get these theyare a little more stiff and compressivethan the other colors overall I thinkthe gym track has done a pretty decentjob with the design of these leggings Ido actually like these leggings a lotbut the color I have is also squat proofso that one's fine of me I just thinklike if you want to make a color likethis you really need to put in an extraeffort and like make the fabric thickermake it more tightly knit or somethingbecause these just really wereunacceptable for any kind of gymactivity I would not recommend thisyellow color to anyone but the othercolors I think you could totally go forthem they're both

another day another gymshark collectionreviewwell hello welcome welcome backthis isn't your first time i'm damienyou're probably neighborhood fitness fanand today we are going to talk aboutjimmy shark'sadapt collection going from ombreto camo to animal seamlessi mean my comfy clothes today so i'mready to chit chatabout some of my favorite activewearlet's get into itokay so we're going to start off withthe most recent releasewhich was the new adapt animal seamlessi think it's a leopard printnow i got it in this leopard color atleast in this colorand also in the black but there wassomething about this gorgeous tealthat just caught my attention so i'mgoing to start off withthe leggings now these leggings have athicker waistband compared to the restof it it's a nice high compression inthe waistband as well so it's going togive you a good snatched effect on thewaiston the side you can see a tiny littlegym shark logoand print now with this logo i'm notnecessarily a fan of it i prefer whenthey just have the little symbolbecause i think that that's more subtlethan like having it written out butit's fine i still love the leggings umin the backthey've got that subtle little bootyscrunch thatgives you just enough glue separationso it's nice and flattering but it's notover the top to where it looks like yourbootyis having your leggings as a snack thatone in particular i'm never a fan ofum the leggings have another logo atthe back on the bottom which is thatlittle logo that's the one i wish to putin the frontbecause i think that subtlety wouldwouldn't distract from the pattern ofthe leggings which i thinkthis particular logo does um thisleggings hit me full lengthi am only five for three so keep that inmind oh and all my other measurementswill be in the description boxbelow this color is nice and squat prooffor me but then it isa slightly darker color so that's gonnahappen also the materialis this really nice gorgeous soft knitseamless materialand usually material like that tends tobe quite squat proofanyways okay from there we're gonna moveon to the mountainsports bar now this is jim shark'ssignature sports bar for the adaptand animal collections it actuallystarted off originally with the gymsharkcamo which was the first one to come outa number of years ago and it was alwaysthis cutecrisscross sports bar that gives yourboobies a nice little liftso it gives you gorgeous cleavage but itstillholds me in i'm a 32b so i find this tobe aboutmedium support for me still it might notbe if you're a little bit bigger than methoughit again has that written outgym shark on the top of the brow bandagain i would prefer that little logobut that's finein the back we've got a whole bunch ofcross overscrisscross detailing which is reallycute and it really draws attention toyour back so if you've done all thatwork building up those back musclesthis bra would really call that outthen at the bottom there's a tiny littlegymshark logoagain the bottom of this sports bar isthisthicker band kind of similar to what thewaistband of the leggings areto give a little bit more compressionbut it's not too tightso you can definitely stick true to sizei find this particular animalseamless collection to be true to sizeboth the sports barand the leggings whereas with the olderones i foundthe leggings still had a little bit ofroom in the waistwhich i will show you actually alrightso moving onwe've got the adapt camoseamless now these are actually one ofmy favoriteever gym shark sets iput them in my best of 2020 video whichi'll leave linked up there if you wantto check that outstarting off with the leggings thisis a camo in this pretty green colorit's not your regular kind of camothoughit's a bit more abstract looking againit has a thicker waistband compared tothe rest of the legging but this is aslightly different materialthan the animal seamless ones wherethis has a bit moresoftness and more sleek feel to itthan the other onesso i think they have changed up thematerial there between this releaseand that one this one was releasedtowards the end of 2020 and that one wasreleased at the end of februarythis year um this is what i was sayingthough with regards to the older adaptcollection was that i havea bit more room with the waist in thisone compared to the other one but ithinkthat is because the waistband of thenewer adapt has more compression in itthan this oneto me this one i'd say is more of alight and medium and the new ones aremore of a medium to high compressionagain it's got that written out logo onthe sideof the legging and the littlegym shark face on the bottom of the backof the leggings these also hit me fulllength and i find them to bepretty squat proof as well they're oneof myfavorite ones to have okay moving on tothe sports bari'm not going to say too much about thisbecause it's exactly the sameas the animal seamlesssports bar um just in this greencamo color the same gym shark written onthe side and the same logo at the bottomin the back with the crisscrossdetailing of the strapsall right last but certainly not leastwe're going to move on to the adaptombre now ombre is something gymsharkhas done for a long timei remember back in the day when theyused to drop their collections and theywould sell out literallyin seconds and i managed to get my handson some of those back thenand they were some of my favoriteleggings at the timeso i was super thrilled when you broughtthem back they originally came backwith like long sleeves and leggingswhich as i'm primarily doing homeworkoutsi wasn't really into getting thembecause i thoughtyou know i had to get the matching set iwould be quite hot when i worked out athomeand i tend to not really lean too muchtowards working out in leggingsanyways because i'm in my house but thenthey pulled a blinder and they came outwith shortsand sports bars and let me tell youabout these shortsokay so these are the adapt ombre shortsin the black i guess it kind oftransitionsinto this grayat the bottom again similar to the otherleggings in the adapt collection it'sgot a much thicker waistband compared tothe restof the shorts you know let's give you agood amount of compressionand a gorgeous snatch on the waistnow these ones are noticed as beingcycling shorts but keep in mind thatthey are nowherenear as long as something like a flexcycling short i think they only aboutfive or six inch inseam which isperfect i've always found the flexcycling shorts to bejust a tad bit too long and i alwayshave to roll them up but this hit meperfectly in mid thigh they're socomfortable as well even with thatcompression in themthe material is again that kind ofsleeker feelingseamless material similar more similarto thecamo than they are to the animal onesin the back the shorts have this linethat goes down the middle of where yourbutt cheeks would be so it gives a tinybit of separation but nothing like youwould with a booty scrunchbut it's still incredibly flatteringthese are alsosquat proof but then again these are inthe black so i'm not sure about what theother colors will be likebut i definitely 100 recommend gettingyour hands in these shortsokay next up we have the sports bar nowi got the sports barmostly because i wanted a matching setbecause as i mentionedbefore the style sports bar is notnecessarily my favorite i think it'sit's nothing to do with the style inparticular i think i've just seen itso many times done by so many differentcompaniesthat i'm kind of i'm over looking atit you know like something a little bitdifferent would be nicebut still going on about thethey've got removable cuff pads in thembut i always leave mine inbecause i just prefer the way it looksum it's got a thicker bandon the bottom of the bra compared to therest of itbut with this particular one i found itto be quite snugso if you're in between sizes sizeup because i'm a true extra smalland i found it was cutting into me alittle bit where it satin the back it just comes together tothis racerback detailwhich i mean it's perfectly niceand it will provide you about a mediumsupport if you're looking to get iti'm just not really 100into as you can see i haven't reallyworn it besides trying it onsimply because of the style of themokay now overall would i recommend thegym sharkadapt collection answer 100 yesespecially with the newer stuff they'recoming out with thatnew animal seamless is sostunning 100 if you're looking for a newlegging set go for that and if you'rewanting the shortsthe ombre shorts i cannot recommend themenoughyou will see when you get them they justhugyour body without squeezing any part ofitthey're nice and comfy they're easy towork out in and you're not worryingabout likepulling them up or hiking them down100 my new faves wellthat's it for me today thank you so muchfor watchingplease like share subscribe and comeback with more fun stuff i've got

[Music]hieveryone i'm lucy and i'm bex andwelcome back to another twin tuesdaysandtoday if you haven't guessed from thetitle we've got a massive massive gymshot ordergot all of the goods here but the thingis i haven't actually ordered anythingand becky's just kind of taken it uponherself to do the orderi really wanted a load of new stuff fromgymshark but i think the most of iti've ordered in the wrong size but ican't wait to show you anyway because ilove all of it and i will berepurchasing it indifferent sizes yeah so it's usually methat has the gym shark obsession it'skind of rubbed off on specs i don'tthink i need any more gym shark but theni look on my site and just want evenmoreso should we get into it and you canshow me the first itemso i went bold and i went safe where doyou want to startshould we go bold first i mean i'mpretty bold in what i'm wearing rightnowi think i'll go with this it reallyclashes but i need to get this in adifferent colorthese are the training leggings inraspberry red so they're literally oncamera it looks so brightit is yeah it's not that bright in reallife i'm sure you'll seeon the triangle but this is feel thematerialthat is so soft that is literally thesoftest thinglike that when you've got it on you feellike you're not wearing anythinglike it's so nice especially when you'reworking out you don't want to feelrestricted as well i pick these up in asize smallwhereas all the others i picked up in amedium so i thinkthese are the only ones that actuallyfit because everything else is just toobig iswear they've changed their sizing sincelike that it's honestly so varieddepending on the collectionon what size you actually are whetheryou need to size down or stick but theseare so stretchy so i think you can sizedown anywaybut it's the softest material everthey're so bold the only thing is i'mself-conscious about my legs and i don'tknow if this would just make me standout too muchyeah but who cares because they havesuch a nice colorthey're so nice they're so bright sothey've got like the little gym shotlogo here and then on the back as welli do quite like these i think they'rejust simple sometimes just simple easieri usually do them in a lot of colorsmaybe if you do like these you couldjust pick them upyeah i i think i'm going to get them ina different color buti love them i think i might just keepthem actually you're going to lose somebright clothing like i've got some blueones that i thought i'd never wear but iwear them all the time sothat's the first pair and just forreference we are size 10 typically uk10.if you want to know sizing for gymsharks we do struggle because we're inbetween sizes of small and mediumanother pair of leggings i'm actuallyobsessed with gymshark leggings yeahthese are the leggingsso i thought these are just black youknow what i can'treally tell which one they are they'redevices are seamless aren't they yeahthey arei love the vital seamless collection idon't actually own anything from itbut i have a sports bra that i'mobsessed with so i've got the matchingsports barsthe only thing is with gymshark i preferthe waistband to be a bitthicker than that and more compressionmore compression because i feel like itsucks me in a bit more like from therolly collectioni love that they're high-waistedhigh-waisted literally makes youactually cannot go wrongbut i don't know if you can see thedetails on them but they've got like areally nice pattern but they're stilllikefully black so they literally go withanything these are too big like they goall baggy around the crotch area andthey're justlike that i think it's because with itfive foot three so we have to pulleverything upslightly a bit more but it's not punchedso it's not ruffled at the bottom butthen it just looks allbunched in random places they've gotreallysubtle booty contours as well that youcan barely see but it's like coolyeah stuff helps no that's cute yeahdefinitely get them in a size smallyeah definitely because you can't gowrong with a black pair leggings iliterally always reach to mygym shop black leggings all the timeover like color like that bright oneis a bit of a statement so but like witha black topand like a black outfit and then youleggings are just like a statement pieceyou know what i feel like going back tothese leggings they would lookreally nice with some white trainers ithought that and thenmethod behind the madness of that is ibought a white t-shirtto go over there right trainerswhite t-shirt and those it's just likesuch a vibethis is actually men's i only looked atthe men's stuff becauseolivia mesha was on about her men'soversized t-shirt that she boughtbut the one that she's on about hasn'treleased yet soi had a look they do this in so manydifferent colors and i just thought tothrow on over the topthe quality actually feels great yeah nothat is like a thick t-shirt that's softas well i feel like everything's soft iknow that sounds weirdbut i think i got this in a size mediumso we'll have to see how it fitsit does look very long yeah it looksvery big because i did want to oversizebut maybe no i see what you mean withthese leggings that would be likea bright outfit but nice like slightlylighter yeahsimple then that would even go with likeany leggings because of the colors of itbut you're going bold with the white ifeel like i just get white so dirty andget makeupget all the i the next thing i picked upwerethat pair of leggings but short versionare they the vital seamless again thenbut the shortsyeah i'm pretty sure i don't mean tobutcher yeah vital seamless shorts andblackgot these in a size medium again sameproblem as beforebut now i've tried shorts on don't knowif they're a bit of meyou know what i feel like we need a bitof a talent i think yeah if you'rewearing shortsyou turn your legs as well like we'reliterally in the worst shape of ourlives and i think a lot of people arebecause the gyms have been shook for ayearso maybe if you like turn your legs geta little bit more confident and in thesummer i think they'll be so nicei just don't think i'm confident enoughto wear them i just put them on and iwas likei'm gonna go do a workout because i feela bit about myself if i'm honesti know i just felt really flat and yeahmy legs felt like i knowsomeone had it just i think becausewe're short it came a bit longer than iwas expectingand because they're big as well yeahi think it's because they didn't fit butyeah no i do like them and i see a lotof people rave about the shorts andthey're really niceno it's a shame they don't fit but likeif you did size down you could wear themunderneath your mounted biking trousersthat's what i wanted them for i wantedto have like something high-waistedunderneath my mounted viking trousers solike when i get back to the car i canactually take them off take my knee padsoff without stripping in a car parkyeah no it makes sense but yeah yeah somaybe you should get them in the sizedownand just see how they think you shouldyeah yeahi also got a thought from i love thecolour of that that looks so niceit's very pink it's undone because itried it on this is actually a sizesmallit felt like my boobs were very squashedbut i think that's becauseit's high support it's high support itjust reminded me of the victoria'ssecret ones that zip upi love them so much and like i justthink look feel the material of that aswellagain really nice soft material yeahwhich it'syeah it's the impact training sports brasunset pink but it's medium impact but ifelt like it had a lot of supportyeah i like it that it's got pads in aswell but i think you can remove themi think you can remove the pads on anysports bra that you do get thoughbut like how cute is that color i dolove it and it probablyworks even better the fact you'rewearing a pink top now i'm after a highimpact sports bra like i have quite afew like the victory secret ones andthey're like thissimilar style i love the fact it's gotlike adjustable straps because a lot ofsports bars don't eitheri know which makes it so awkward doesn'tit i like the back of it how it's gotlike a holeyeah that's what i like the details andeverything i just thought i might aswell try it outbecause yeah why not but have you seenthat ombre andum camo that's really seen like i needto get something of that like i knowi keep seeing it everywhere and i'm justlike i need iti know i've got like a green sports brathat i need the matching leggings andi'm really hoping that they restocki might take some of this back thatdoesn't fit because it's too big andjust go a bit crazy a bit bold go forthe new collectionespecially with ombre it's so prettyyeah there's all thesepeople on instagram which makes me spendmy money and it's badum so this is actually the last thing igot so i picked upthis can we just say something can wetell that you're obsessed with baby pinkand pink and pink and pink at the minutei'm a bit obsessed with pink i thinkit's because i spray my white pink andthen it's like i just need everything tomatchbut i don't know how i feel about it soi saw uh olivia mesha wear it all on herinstagram and it looksso nice on her but i think i just got itin a size too big because it's oversizedanywaybut i'm always like oh i like my hoodiesoversized let me size up which if it'soversized you don't need tosize it oversized the color is just socute it's like a dusty pink it's verysimple but like look how long it is ofcamera nowno i do like some like long hoodies buti get what you mean but like this is abitthis is another level considering we'refive foot three i could wear this as adressno definitely size down and get it whatis the hoodie thoughso they've got this in quite a fewcolors this one doesn't actually have alabel on it we'll put it on screenstrange it doesn't have a label on itand so i can't double check what it isthis is actually really nice i thinkit's like an everyday one rather than aworkout one because it's got likereally nice fleece lining yeahyou know when sometimes you get thoseones which don't have fleece and it'sjust likeyou still get cold tubes you need onethat's just like warm and cozyso yeah i definitely get that size downthoughbut i i was getting them to like they'renot wearing an oversized hoodie withshortsyeah i get one that goes the vibe andthen the black would goyeah and then i thought you know theblack leggings with the pink sports braand then this together so i was kind ofgoing after outfityeah no i see where you're going fromi'm like not the mosti'm very basic colors but when it goesto the gym i'll kind of fold poppiercolorseven though this is a bit of a statementbut this is a bit different for me weare very blackno definitely you've literally made mewant to do a gym shark order thoughso when you send stuff back and doanother order i'm gonna have to add allover the top yeah i think we're gonnahave to do like a part two of the otherstuffyeah as we did a workout earlier and wedidn't realize how it would fit and howwe've lost our fitness so quicklyi think the thing is i'm mountain bike ahell of a lot but i stillstruggled like i know i think it's morestrength but honestly i just can't waitto get back into the gym get my fitnessupand there's no better way to do thatthan spend all your money at gymsharkand get new gym clothes because youalways feel a lot more motivated afterthatyeah but i definitely need to get theseones in as many different colors as icanbecause i just feel so soft i wish youcould feel that yesdefinitely so that is

usually it'slike three weeks or more let's see whatwe gotoh oh yeah boom come back this is thereI don't even know what you want to callthis element t-shirt it says size mediumhopefully it fits I think I'm reallystarting to get closer to a large now ohthat's sold out and everything oh yeahso I got I sent back the other tank topsit didn't fit me and got a large versionboomsuper sick I picked up a couple of theirseamless t-shirts size medium sincethat's what I wore the other onehopefully the sizes didn't change ifthey did I'm gonna send a very angryangry letter so got a gray one and thenthat's sick read size medium so I'mgonna try these on real quick andcatching with you in second also if youguys aren't following me on Instagramboom go get your boy or follow guys juststarts Jarek camp easy to focusing thereyou go go kinda sexy posts on theirinspirational posts motivationaleducational anything that has an AOL atthe end so toss me follow and let's trysome of these shirts on I want to try onthis guy first so I'll catch I'm sickalright so here it is guys this is areally cool shirt it's very differentfrom all other shirts this is a prettymuchsometimes like polyester or somethingbut it's got like the back is prettymuch wide open it's all breathable butit's pretty nice honestly it's it's cuta little bit odd in my opinion becauseit's super tight looking at all theruffles over here which is fine becauseyou want to show off the gums anyway butum and it's a little bit a little bitboxy er this is the medium is actuallypretty big for a medium it looks reallynice like look at that practice atmintues eCos looking pretty sick that'sa really cool this shirt looks awesomein pictures so I'm excited take somesome pigs with my camera on this guy sothere you go men's element size mediumpretty cool shirt I've never seen likesomething cut like this before with withthe yellow up here in the gray I reallylike it so cool let's try out a minutelet's do do the tank tops let's see ifthe large fits me instead of the mediumsI had before and this color is prettywild so I'll try this on catch you in asecond okay so this is the seamless tankand a large fits a lot better it's stillthey might can you cut a little bitweird but um I think this should be alittle bit longer I guess it's not thatbad we'll see hopefully they don'tshrink it all stuff falling off but I'mreally cool color this is bolt synccolors are seamless teacher yeah courseif you're tight so you know definitelyget a size up guys if you're if you'relooking to pick up one of those tanktops I think ones enough for me justbecause of the way they fityeah I would have cut a little bit lowerI think they asked my opinion and maybeelongated them just a tiny bit butthat's just meand I've done a previous review on theseguys so if I maybe I'll put that link itup in the description below if you wantto see that video also even though Itook this shirt off when I was searchingfor sizes on this guy on YouTube Ididn't really see any good videos on itso I'm just going to show you like alittle bit more of a close-up of thisshirt what the materials are like I saidthis is a medium you can see right herethe materials on this shirt I've neverseen Jim shark really use I don't knowwhat I would call this material let'ssee if they say in here just a bunch ofuseless information and it doesn't sayon here either but um it's it'sbasically like a polyester I think Susanyeah 100% polyester made in Turkey umbut the backs wide open if you see thepart that hangs over the yellow it'sjust complete breathable area this iscompletely see-through which is reallynice for when you're working out becauseI sweat a lot on my back and then theother thing that's cool about this ifyou see the front of it it's got acollar that kind of goes down and thenstops and go straight across there thatactually looks really cool it almostlooks like a little dressy I don't knowhow to explain that when you're wearingit but it's really cool and then thisfront part is all obviously allpolyester but still really breathableit's kind of a cool material not verystretchy so like I said this is a mediumthey're pretty boxy a little tight onthe sleeves so if you have big arms youmight need to go up a size which willsuck because they're not going to helpyou very much but still really coolshirt they look really cool on so that'sthe Jim sharkit says element but I'm not sure ifthat's what a cup it's called I'll findout and put on the put a littledescription there for you so there yougo I'm going to try on one of their newseamless t-shirts I'm hoping they fitexactly the same asthey're seeing those t-shirts all theydid is I think just come out the new tonew colors these Brett's a gray in a redand they made the gym shark blackinstead of gray like it was before orsilver I think it was so let me throwone of these on and I'll catch you in asecondfilming okay okay this is a six shirtguys so they fit exactly the same as theold seamless t-shirts which I've shownyou guys before like I said I have ablue one and I've gotten bolt in theresee how they used to have it in silverthe gym shelf logo and silver on thesleeve so now they put it in blackbecause it stands out more and they'resmart they want to market their productswhen you're wearing them so this is thered I would call it more but like Idon't even know it's almost like a moralmaybe I made that up but here you golook sick it makes your shoulders upstupid huge maybe it's just my shouldersI'm not sure but big old 16 inch armslook at those Peaks guys look at thosePeaks I swear I did not work on my armfor it before this video so that's thered looks very nice you can see the backstill has the breathable area runningdown it running down the sides justawesome shirts guys when you get apumping these things you feel like asuperheroand then anyway so I guess I'll show youwhat the gray looks like real quick andthen I'll be alright and we have a greatone very nice very similar to the redthey've added a little bit they'vechanged the color scheme a little bit Imean they didn't yeah I guess I didn'tit was always kind of like that wellthere's like lines of

there so itry to help you guys decidewhat's worth it and what's not withoutfurther ado let's get into the video ifyou're a regular on my channel you knowabout my cat peachthis is my new little kitten pinto he'svery excited to be on camera he has alittle crinkle ear because he had alittle problembut he will be in some new videos firstwe have the gymshark adapt animalseamless in light greenit's really more of a teal blue to mebut to each their own these are 60so they're definitely on the high end ofgymshark leggings and they're called theanimal seamlessand on their story they said that thiswas inspired by a sharkif anyone wants to send me a picture ofa shark that looks like this i'd love tosee itum nothing wrong with that i just likedon't really think it looks like a sharkbut i do like the pattern i think itlooks coolso at first glance these definitely doremind me of the gymshark camo seamlessthey have a thick ribbed waistbandusually this provides a lot ofcompressionthe rest of the legging is a similarknit material but it's not as thick andribbed as the topthe camo leggings always provided a lotof compression and i definitely seethese providing a lot of compression aswellthey just have one of their likepress-on logos on the side i don't lovethe press-on logos with the camo theyactually like embroidered it into thefabric which i always loved about thecamosso i don't love this little change iwish they had done that with these aswell they have these subtle little kindof like embroidered booty scrunch so ifyou're not into a full booty scrunch ithink these are a nice compromisesometimes with really thick seamlessleggingsit can give you that unibat look so thiskind of helps like separate the booty alittle more without being a full scrunchand they have another little gym sharklogo on the bottom i did get these in mynormal size smallso we'll see how they fit i also gotthem in the black i told you guys peachwouldn't be gone this is peach if you'renew hereshe's my little girl alright so here arethe leggingsthere's pg yet again so they're solidhigh rise for some reason i feel liketheoriginal camos were a little bit higherof a rise these ones are just barelycovering my belly buttonand i felt like the old camos went abovemy belly button um i definitely tried topull these up a loti'm not so sure about the sizing i didget my normal size smalland down here in like the leg area ibasically used up like all of thestretchthere's barely any stretch left in likethe leg areas because i feel like it'sbeing pulled really tightbut the waistband almost is a little bitbig i feel like it's not giving me awhole lot of compression at the topso i think i would still go with yournormal size but i don't love that i feelpretty tight in the legsand the waistband i could stand for alittle bit more compression hereespecially because the waistband is sothick and ribbed i feel like itdefinitely could compress moremy measurements are all down below ifyou want to comparei do have a pretty small waist but stillusually i find that gym sharp leggingsare compressive on the waistthese are definitely a thicker warmerpair of leggings kind of surprised theywould release these around thesummertime because they definitely arewarmum i don't really see myself like goingoutside in these anytime soon becausethey're definitely kind of like a thickknit here's a close-upof the waistband in the fabric thesewill be very good at camouflaging anycellulite because of the pattern andalso the thick knit material is justgood at hiding any imperfectionsi find that the waistband is dippingdown a teeny bit in the back i thinkit's just because of the booty scrunchbut i kind of just wish these were likea little bit higher of a waist they arevery flattering on the bootyi love this little booty scrunch becauseit's super subtle but it just gives youlike a little bit of booty separationi think i would definitely give these ahigh on the booty scale there's no camelgoingon here and very minimal gathering interms of length they are more of a 78 length on me this is kind of how allgym shark leggings have been for me fora while nowum so if you're shorter it's probably alittle bit better but if you're on thetall side i am five nineum they might not be a full length onyou but i don't think these areawkwardly shortand the fabric is super thick so theyshould be entirely squat proofthis type of fabric is really good aboutnot pilling and not collecting any lintso it is a pretty durable fabric i wouldwear this on a leg day or something likethatit's definitely a performance legging soyeah the more i look at them the more ilike them i just wish they had a littlebit more stretch to them in the leg areaand a little bit more compression in thewaistbut overall i think they're pretty goodthis type of legging does feel prettytight in this region the seams don'thave like a ton of stretch to themi've never had an issue with my gymshark leggings ripping but it does feelpretty tightwhen i squat just so you know so i'm alittle confused right nowthe black ones feel like a totallydifferent pair of leggings so usuallywhen you have a darker fabricthere's less stretch to it because thedarker colors have more dye in themand the dye makes them a little lessstretchy but these black ones aredefinitelythinner than the green and they're somuch more stretchylike you saw on my last one that theyhad barely any stretchthese have so much more stretch to themi'm really glad i got both colorsbecausei feel like that's really weird let meknow in the comments down below if youhave both and if you've had the sameexperience but these are definitelythinner and stretchier i wish the greenones felt like these because idefinitely appreciate the extra stretchthe waistband still is a tiny bit on theloose side i feel like i could have alittle bit more compression so yeahbasically all the same notes as the lastones on these butif you're looking for a stretchierslightly less compressive pair ofleggings i would go withblack the green i give a highcompression the black i give a mediumcompressionin the waistband all around i give it amedium compression just because i don'tfeel like it's squeezing in a whole lot[Music]next i got the sports bra and this is 45also my ac just turned on so if there'sa little noise that's what it is it'svery hot herei live in the desert in the past thesecamo style sports bras the ones with thewrap detail have kind of been cleavagecentraland i personally have never worn them tothe gym because i just feel like it's alittle too much for mei do have a larger cup size so it's justkind of like in your faceso i did get a size medium in this colorand i got a size smalland the black just to kind of see if themedium would maybe not likepush the girls up as much and be havethem so in your facei am normally a small in sports brows soi figured sizing up may help with thatit has a cute kind ofwrap detail in the front and for girlswith smaller girls usually this providesa little likecleavage lift i love the littlecrisscross like wrapping style detail inthe backi always love that about the sports braand then they just have a classic gymshark logo on the backthe bottom band of the sports bra isribbed just like the legging waistbandall right here's a sports bra in thesize mediumi do think i like the size up especiallyif you have a bigger cup size i wouldconsider going size upbecause i just feel like i'm lesssquished down i'll try on the smallafter this but in the past the small inthe sports bra has like really pushed upa lotand it was just a lot for me the braband i wouldn't say it's loose but it'sjust not squeezing me in a whole lotobviously because i sized up it's apretty deep v sports bra i wouldn't saythis is way too much for meit's a solid medium support especiallyif you're in your normal size i thinkit'll compress down a lot morethis obviously isn't holding me in quiteas much because it is a little bitbiggerthe back on the sports bra is super cutethe sports bar is also like verycomfortable i've never found the strapshave been cutting into methe fabric is pretty soft and the strapsare pretty thick so it doesn't cut inanywhere or feel uncomfortable i've beenwanting to try out a few new like sportsbra testsso let me know in the comments if thisis helpful but we're going to do jumpingjack teststhe jog test and the bend over test tosee kind of like if everything stays inplaceso first jumping jacksand yeah we're still bouncing around alittle bit that's to be expected with amedium support sports bra but i stilldidn't feel like i was falling outand jogging is the same i would give ita solid medium and bending overyeah i think we're set i don't think i'mgoing anywhere it has really good sideboob coverage i feel completely coveredon the sides and even though there's alittle bit of cleavage here i still feelmostly covered so yeah i would say it'sa pretty solid sports braand this is the small sports bra iactually don't think it's too bad anddefinitely getting a little more supportin the smaller size i do just want tosay something i don't love about thesports brais that this thing wraps across and itcompresses likethe lower boob a lot but then like notthe upper boob so you kind of get like alittle likei don't know divot thing it's not themost flattering so yeah i actually don'tmind the size small at all i still feellike i'm getting very good coverageand not a whole lot of cleavage so ithink that these small is actually fine[Music]next we have the adapt marl seamlessleggings i got these in the color graybut they also come in black and a tealblueand just as a first glance i feel likethese are kind of like a hybrid of thecamoand the old ombre fabrics they're alittle softer than the old ombre fabricsfor some reason the ombrecould kind of feel like a little itchysometimes same with the vitals but thewaistband does seem a little morestructured than the ombrei used to have and love the ombreseamless but the waistband would alwaysstretch out like it would be tight wheni would first wear it and then at theend of my workout it would be all looseso i never loved that about it so i'mhoping that doesn't happen with theseeitherthey have a thick ripped waistband itdoes look like the camo seamlessbut the fabric itself is less of a thickknit material it's definitely thinnerthan the animal seamless and it's a lotsofter to the touchand it has a moral to it and in the backinstead of a booty scrunch like theadapt animal seamless it has one ofthose raised booty seamsthis kind of like helps to separate thebooty a little bit it kind of adds alittle seamwhile still being seamless i don't knowi feel like it always helps a little bitbut it's not going to be as enhanced asthe booty scrunchoverall these are pretty plain leggingslike there's no details that arescreaming out to methere's no booty contour there's nothinglike that and they do have a gym sharklogo on the side here again just thepress-on onewould like to see an embroidered logo atsome point and a simpleguess it crotch guys i had such a bigbreakfast before this and i just feellike i am fighting the food coma rightnow and i regreteverything okay so these kind of aren'twhat i expectedthey kind of feel like the lightweightseamless except with a little more holdand compressionthese are definitely a solid mediummaybe medium to high compressionleggingsa little more stretch than the animalseamless but the waistband is definitelyholding me in a lot moreso i do like the waistband better onthese it's a little bit higher doescover my belly buttonand it definitely looks like it has morethickness and hold than the old ombreseamless waistbandso these should stay pretty tight in thewaist i don't expect this waistband toloosen up you are going to getless cellulite coverage in theseleggings they definitely are pretty thinthey do have a little bit of a marl toit and they are thicker than like agymshark lightweight seamlessbut definitely not as much side lightcoverage as the animal seamless thosewere very thickand very compressive had a little holdthese are actually still prettyflattering on the booty they don't havea booty contourbut they are hugging me in all the rightplaces and the little like fake raisedseam thing is helping as well so i givethese a medium to highdefinitely not going to collect any lintthey're pretty slick they're not shinythoughand they are again a 7 8 length not afull length on methey have a lot more stretch than theanimal seamless pretty similar to theblack ones actually because the blackones are a lot more stretchythan the green i don't have any cameland there's minimal gathering yet againany seamless legging you have is goingto hug this areaa little bit so just be mindful of thati have to say i kind of thought thatthese are just going to be like basicskip them but i actually do like them ithink they fit me better than the animalseamlessi like the extra stretch to them i meanyou can find a solid pair of seamlessleggings for cheaperprobably but if you are looking to getsomething from gymshark i don't thinkthese are a bad option i am wearing asize smallyet again and i think that this is aperfect fit so i would go with yournormal size for theseand i don't expect these to be entirelysweat proofso i don't know if i have any pair ofleggings that's entirely sweat proof butjust you know these probably will show alittle bit of sweatprobably only light cellulite coveragenot a ton and yeah these weren't what iexpected them to be but i actually likethemway more than i thought[Music]and lastly we have the adapt marlseamless sports bra in grayi didn't get the long sleeve justbecause i kind of feel like a longsleeve is pretty easy like they'reprobably not going to mess that up but idid get the sports brathis one's kind of like a double layersituation this one is 45and they claim it to be a low support ifeel like you get a solid medium supportout of this because it does have thedouble strapsyou have a set of crisscross straps andthen you have a set of straps that kindof come into this little trianglesituation in the backand i kind of thought the straps wouldbe adjustable but they're not adjustablethe fabrics of the inner and outersports bra look a little bit differentto methe inner one is a little bit darker andperhaps a little less mild and the outerone is a little bit lighter so it kindof gives a little contrastand like a little piping string alongthe edge is also a darker gray and thebroadbandis similar to the legging waistband allright so here's the sports brait actually has really good coverage ihave no side boob spillage whatsoeverand it has a scoop neck but i reallydon't have any cleavageit's pretty compressive here i do likemy normal size small so i would go trueto size they said this was a lightsupporti would say this is a solid mediumsupportpretty good on the jumping jacks and weare notlosing anything bending over sodefinitely going to hold you in thestrappy back is really cuteyeah i don't really have much more tosay it's a pretty basic sports bra ithink this whole set togetherjust like the plain gray it's definitelylike super basic so if you're lookingfor something a little more exciting i'dprobably go with the animal seamlessbut it is pretty solid so[Music][Applause][Music]all right guys so that is it for thereview i have to say overallthings were pretty good i didn't havetoo many complaints i was a littleconfused about the color differencesfor the animal seamless but i definitelythink i like the black animal seamlessand the marvel seamless leggingsthey definitely are a little bit highlypriced especially the mars seamless ijust feel like they look so basic idon't know if i'd spend55 dollars on them but they're not badand honestly the gymshark summer sale iscoming up so if you can get them forlike 20off my only issue with the animalseamless was a little bit about thesizingbut overall not too many complaints ikind of knew this going into this reviewbecause i did really like the gymsharkcamo seamless i kind of expectedto like these sets a lot because theyare similar so wasn't too surprised butdefinitely was not disappointed todayi hope this review was helpful and if itwas please give it a thumbs up andsubscribeand i will see you guys next time bye,26,UCqOC1SiA6v994Sx_WR1-xew,Kathryn Mueller,285,27,0,2593,"['gymshark', 'gymshark leggings', 'gymshark haul', 'gymshark review', 'gymshark women',

what's up guys so today we are going tobe spilling some teaexposing whatever you want to say butI'm going to be talking about my issueswith Jim shark not just specifically myissues with like the brand of generalbecause I think there are a lot of likethere's been a lot of controversy aboutthe prices and everything recently Ibeen a customer of Jim shark for over ayear now and I have some items that I'vehad for about a year I've had items thathave had for less than a year and I justhave some issues with themJim shark is probably one of the mostpopular activewear brands at the momentthey're very hyped up they're all overInstagram they have millions millions offollowers and I would definitely saythat people often compare them toLululemon in terms of like two bigbrands of activewear and I just reallydon't think that they compare in thequality to loot lemon I've had pairs ofLululemon leggings that I've had for sixor more years and the worst thing thathave happened to the leggings is thatI've gotten some pilling and that it'sjust you know that's expected but I'venever gotten any rips or tearsthey become sheer or anything andstretched out and I really can't say thesame about Jim shark today I'm going tobe going through a few of my pieces ofJim shark after wear that I've had forI'll tell you how long I've had each oneand just the issues with it and how ithas not held up with quality anotherthing to say is that Jim shark continuesto raise their prices they're reallypumping out the launches very quicklyand I just think that sometimes theymight be ignoring quality in a way Ifeel like no one really talks about thisand it just I feel like I really neededto show you guys I do I do stillpurchase from Jim shark I really thinkthat their stuff is very cute but it'snever something that I see as like mymost high quality items so my very veryfirst item I ever got from Jim shark wasa pair of their Flex leggings and I haveto say I don't love their Flex leggingsI don't think they're very flattering atall I mean the waistband is just soshort and I personallyhigh weights a very confident with mybody but like I don't like wearingthings with low waist cuz I just don'tthink it's very cute and what hashappened to these is within my veryfirst like a few times of wearing themthe waistband like it's it just reallyseems like it's stretching out can yousee it looks like like so the actualelastic part is now like here and likethis is just like the fabric it reallyyou can't quite see but it is justreally sheared out around the seam andit just makes me uncomfortable that likemaybe that might be like going away andI also want to say that I think verygood care of my after where I am verycareful with all of my clothes I barelydry any of my clothes I wash all of myactivewear in in garment bags or they'renot clothes garment bags but you knowlike a little like delicates bags in mylaundry I turn them inside out so that Idon't damage the outside of the clothesand I have never dried any of this stuffso you cannot say that I am just nottaking care of my activewear becausealso all of my other active wares what'snot fine but yeah here's the outside ofthe waistband it's definitely juststretching out a bit you can see on thetop it's kind of fraying a little bitthere's a piece of the elastic that iscoming out there and I just like don'tthink that this should happen I don'teven wear these like that that muchbecause I don't love them also thecrotch area on these leggings is reallyreally tight it really doesn't stretchvery well but you can kind of tell likethat this part isn't really the stringis a very stretchy so whenever you'retrying to stretch out the gym they justit really feels like it's pulling andI'm always like I just waiting the daythat might go in the crotch actually myfriend was just telling me the other daythat her very first pair of phloxleggings she had to get rid of becauseshe got a hole in the crotchyou should not if you're making activewear it needs to be able to hold up forstretching like you should not be givingwools in the crotch and also on by onthe seam you can see it's very likefuzzy it's become very fuzzy and likefrom rubbing together a lot like I meanmy thighs serve togetherI mean as a brand that caters towardsathletic people who like building theirmuscles you should like you shouldexpect some thigh rubbing because youknow people's people have to build theirlegs me next item I don't know if thiswas okay so those slacks leggings areover in your old now which I don't thinkis too long to expect a pair of leggingsto last especially for a $40 pair ofleggings and this is the next item I gotis this flex crop top and I did get asmall and this which like maybe I shouldhave gotten a medium in this but one ofafter one of the very first times I woreit it got a big hole in the armpit likethis see look there's a bigger big holein the armpit and like I just like youknow there is I don't think they'resewing jobs are very strong if you'regetting holes like that's just not notcute and like I should probably fix thisat some point to be honest I still wearit when I'm not doing upper body daysI'm not like lifting my armpits up a lotbut I just don't think that's veryacceptable for like I'm serious likewhat one of the first times I wore thismaybe even the first time I wore thisthe this hole happened and I just don'tthink that's acceptable like you get theseaming on the other side seems a lotbetter than on the one side maybe thisis a defect but you're probably notgonna be able to see this but the littlestrings yeah all of this area right herejust looks like it's kind of fallingapart and I have had this now forprobably just about one year it's justI wanna be walking around the gym with abig ol on my armpit like at least is myarmpit not my crotch and then I've hadthese leggings now these are the energyseamless I've had these for probably alittle less than a year now and fromabout the first time I wore them Istarted getting runs in the holes and Iunderstand that this is a delicatefabric but I also I'm very careful aboutputting my leggings on and watching themas we said but I have several littleruns as you can see and see these areall the runs it's like you know whenyou're in tights and you can you getthem caught on the thing and they runthat's what happens to these they justtotally get little runs everywhere and Ijust think that they could have done alittle better on this I don't know thiseyelid detailing a lot of mine havelittle bronze actually and I just worryabout that I also worry about thesecoming um coming undone in the crotchbecause again the crotch seams are verystiff like here's like pulling theleggings I'm getting a decent amount ofstretch but when you pull the seams youget like nothing at all and I just don'tthink it's too much to ask to wear tohave like a you know good quality likestretchy stitch no I have a mob of Ihave runs everywhere also if you everwear I which I did see I used to lovewearing energy seamless on my life daysbecause I liked the compression theyoffer and I felt like their thing forlike days but now I can't wear them uplike this because but if you have a bandaround if you like do band work if yousee how it gets all fuzzy here like theyget like all these little fuzz is thethese are just like such delicate littlelike eyelets that whatever you'rewearing a band around them and the bandstretches on them and just like ruins itlike I know that it's an issue with theband I don't know other than that theother GC must have held up very well Ihaven't had any like actual holes inthem but I used to be a die-hard energyseamless girl like I use my favoritepair of the dream shark leggings butlately just because I can't now like nowthat I realize I can't do any band workin them I don'ttend to do it to use them very muchanymore and now for my last pair let youtype a problem with these are the ombreseamless I just so first of all theboutique contour comes down to like mymid thigh and like that's just not verycute so I don't like that if but mymajor problem with these is that when Ifirst wore them they were like reallynice around the waist I felt like theyreally like hugged my waist in andoffered some compression and after likeone or two times of wearing them thewaistband stretched out so much like youcan even see it's kind of like it kindof I don't know just like bubbles alittle bit it's just so stretched outand like I don't have a very largestomach don't really know why itstretched out so much but like I have topull these up all the time now they'reall stretched out circlip said like howstretched out they are when when I firstbought them I promised they were rightagainst my stomach but these aren't sizesmall I'm a size small and everythingelse and those all fit it's just thesestretch out and I know that like some ofthe gym track athletes will say like ohthey bounce back after a wash but thesehave been washed and not dry becausedrying is bad for after where I'vewashed these and every time now likemaybe after the first time they wouldbounce back after wash but they nolonger bounce back after a wash andmakes me sad because I love the color ofthese leggings I have American sportsbra and everything I always get a lot ofcompliments on them but the waistband isjust like those are all of items of joeshark that I've had problems with Idon't think I've purchased anything in awhile from them that I've wornconsistently that I've had issues withnow I have I have like their flawlessknit collection I haven't had any issuesabout so far except I also can't do anyband work with my legs and those becausethey have the eyelet detailing as wellso it's very delicate I think Toob checkdoes for the most part a good job ontheir squawk roof nests which is goodcamel toe there is like almost alwayssingle camel at least to me sharp butyeah I just wanted to share this withyou guys because I do talk a lot abouttrim sharp on this channel but I justwant you to know that they're not like Idon't love everything about them andthey definitely have some quality issuesI mean holes scratchinglike like seems ripping I just thinkthat that can definitely be improvedI do think Jim Jacques improving theirquality and from some recent collectionsI've seen I really like their camoseamless I think that they'rehigh-waisted flex I think the iOS appLux is good but I think I really need towork on making their scenes moreflexible because I can't like I I'm adancer I need to be able to do thesplits do stretching and I can't do themin their leggings because it's so tightso yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this letme know if you've had issues with dripchar quality and the comments down belowbecause I feel like I can't be the onlyone I mean my friend had her crotch riplike that's so embarrassing what ifyou're at the gym and you're cropped asa whole it is so yeah thank you guys somuch for watching if you enjoyed mespilling some tea you know give it athumbs up and subscribe if you're not soalready and yeah thank you guys so muchfor watching and I'll see you next

don't mind meall right um so i'm gonna get in tothe first outfit um i have to actuallyput on a real sports bra for this notthe gym shark sports bras are not realit's just thatguys let's let's be honest i'm gonnasave the best for last so you betterwatch the whole freaking video okayall right i'll be right back just incase you're wondering i am going to beputting a she fit sports bra underneaththe clothesum if you are looking for a braum that fits really like i'm a hyou know what i mean so if you'relooking for as far as bra for like plussize women you can check out my sheetfitvideos i have two of themone on my original review on she fit andthen another one on the differencebetween the flex sports bra and ultimatesports braum but if you're wondering what i'mputting underneath the shirts todayit is going to be the she fit bra soi'll be right backall right guys so i put on the firstoutfit and i'm a little madthis has never happened before so i'mgonna reach out to jim sharkabout this directly but there's alreadya hole in my leggingum they fit um i don't knowwhat the heck happened or why there's ahole in my legging butit's literally right in my butt umright here it's like a runum and the crazy thing is that thisi felt this before i actually put thelegging on like i was like what the heckis that and i felt a little hole andthen now like now that they're on is abigger holeand it's like i think that they'realready faulty and it'sso weird because i don't remember itbeing there but umwhatever let's just continue with thehaul i'm sure they're gonna reach backout to meto either give me a refund or send meanother pair i hopeum but let's start with the shirt theshirt is really super comfortableum you gotta keep in mind that i'mpushing the size shirt when it comes tothe shirtsi mean it fits um but i do have reallylarge chests so things that are supposedto fit loosefit tight on me because i have a bigchest and they don't have a plus-sizesection in gymsharkum the leggings are really super nice umthe butt looks atrocious because there'sa huge freaking holebut there's like the butt piece that'ssupposed to go like the crackwhich you can't really tell becausethere's a hole there now umit literally looks atrocious but they'rereally super comfortablelike there's like this run is sobig i can't get over itbut um they're really cute pantsuh these are a large um and like i saidbeforethey're i usually get extra large on gymsharkbut the whole happens without me puttingthem onjust to be clear like i felt the holebeforei even threw the bad boys on i'm likewhat the heck is thislike even if it shouldn't rip that fastespecially if they fit likethere's still extra space here you knowwhat i mean it's not likeit's too tight for me to actually fitreally niceso i'm a little annoyed but i'm gonnajust say you know i've ordered fromgymshark a few times this is the firsttime i've hadproblems with the gymshark items solet's just let that go for today um butyeah other than thati thought that this would match a littlebit better it doesn't but this that'sokay because i have black leggings so icould probably just pair thiswith a black legging um but this shirtis really really super softum i really actually love it it has likethis in the backit's like a sort of like scrunched updifferent material that they sewtogether i don't know how to explain itum but it's a really beautiful colorand i'm a little annoyed about the runi'm not even gonna from a littleannoying about the run because i reallylike the color of these leggingsbut i can't wear them in public anymorethese leggings i've been trying to get amatching set from gymsharkfor the longest time and it's so hardbecause they have their sales and thenthey don't havematching sets in my size so i need anextra large and extra large but a lot ofpeoplewill go and buy extra large and maybe ameeting legging and it's reallyfrustrating because people like me whoare actuallyextra large can never get matching setssoum but it's still a cute outfit ummaybe i'll put in the description boxwhich one this is buthopefully that doesn't happen to youguys um i have two other pairs ofleggings sowe're not gonna let this ruin the dayso let me get into the next outfit okaybut let me know what you think aboutoutfit number oneand the run of my buttthis must just be something faultybecause this has never happenedi have large gym sharks uh leggings andextra large gym shark leggings and noneof them have ever ripped soi don't know all right so let me getinto thenext one okay i have outfit number twoon right now guysum this one is a little bit tighter iknew that the shirt was gonna be alittle bit tighterthis all right these are both extralarge umthese are really tight um there's noholes in itdifferent materials a little bit more ofthat uhit's not like a cotton it's like aa lot more spandex spindex in it spandecks in it umthey're not as high rise as the otheroneswhich i'm a little confused because igot thosein a large and i get these in an extralargeand these are tighter so i'm a littleconfusedwhat do you guys think um my backpack'sout if you're one of those people whocares about that then don't buy thisstuffi can't wait to work out in them becausethey're really comfortable it's justthat the material is reallyhot i feel like i should be outside inthis in the coldum it doesn't have the finger holesit smells like rubberso yeah what do you guys think of outfitnumber twoi'm really mad because i really love thecolor of those last leggings butthis is cute i guess cute little colori feel like i look like a bro i'm justbright like if i go to the gym like thispeople are like who do you think you areum and it's funny because the band fitsunderneath my boobso i mean this fits mei'm a size 16 typically um so if you'regetting gym shark you're pushing thelimit i justlike to tell people that i want you tothink that this is for plus-sized womenit's literally not i just wanted to seeifi could fit it um if you'rethis much bigger than me it's not gonnawork umi'm so bad about the other leggings guyslike i'm still mad like it's fineall right um what do you think of numbertwothis is more but i'm talking about thefit it fits wellno rips there's nothing it it's goodit's stretchyi'll probably work out on this today andlet you guys know how it goes socomment below all right so i have onemoreit's a sports bra and i'm scared i'mscared out of my mind and i have a blackleggingwhich i purchased prior to and i lovethem so much that i bought them again soi figured i'd show you guysthis time let me go ahead and put on mylast jumpstart outfiti'll be right back no freaking wayno freaking way that this fitsall right all right let me just sayi am genuinely shocked by thisum i'm very shocked like the fact that ican even get it on is really crazyso the one thing i want to express aboutgymshark is that it's really reallystretchy they're really reallycomfortable leggings andi don't have a lot of big hips i havebig boobs so for me to get into leggingsit is it's not hard for me to get mybutt or my hipsand my stomach into them because i feellike i'm on the smaller size of 16in my legs and like a bigger size and 16around my waistbut i have the sports bra on and i'mactually genuinely shocked that it fitsthis is crazyum i'm gonna probably take the breastpads outbecause that's not doing anythingbut here's the back there's no way thatthis is fittinggymshark you just blew my freaking mindthat's how stretchy your stuff is thatsomeone who's like a size h can squeezeinto a sports brathat's od my sister's gonna freak igotta go show heri am impressed bro i mean my boobs areof course all out on thetop but like i could fit their sportsbrasthis is not like a highcapacity sports bra out hurts it's notlike she fit butit's just interesting that i can wearthem if i want tookay i'll probably wear it around thehouse buti'm literally shocked i'm going to takethefood pad out because this is yourstretch stretched to its maxi wouldn't suggest buying sports fromgymshark if you're trying to get it forhold because why would it do thatwhen you have big

hey there my name is hannah and welcomeback to my channeli'm not really sure what we do here buti would appreciate it if you join mealong for the journey and we can figureit out togetherso today i am going to go throughwith you not that anyone really caresall of my workout leggingswhile i am surprised at the number ofleggings i have i am also surprised thati don't havemore many of these leggings i've had forseveral years like i would assume theoldest pair in here might bebetween 8 and 10 years old no word of aliebecause i'm a dancer andyou know leggings are kind of somethingyou wear to dance classa lot and now i go to theater schoolso i pretty much wear leggings everysingle dayso the fact that i only have 17 pairs ofleggings is kind of surprising to me butalso17 pairs of leggings is a lot ofleggings foran average normal person anyway ithought it might just be fun to do acutelittle try on haul and tell you about myleggingsi will be completely honest with youmost of these leggings except for thegym shark oneswhich are most of the leggings if i'mbeing completely honestbut pretty much all of the leggings thataren't gym sharkare no longer being sold a lot of theseleggings arekind of old so if you haven't already iwould so appreciate it if yousubscribe leave me a comment down belowgive it a like ring the bell blah blahblah blah blahyou know how it all goes umyeah let's get into this for the firstpair of leggings i have herei'm gonna guess that these ones are atleasteight years old possibly 10.i've had these leggings for a long longtimeum it's this cute pair of adidasleggingsthey are full length and on thebottom they have this like reflectivething so if you're the kind of personwho runsheadlights from cars will hit thereflective bit and they'll see you but imeanrunning like that's really funny becauseno i'm not gonna run i hate runningbecause these leggings are so old theyare no longer soldhowever i can tell you a little bitabout them they're made with theclimalite materialand they are techfit which i believe isa line that adidasstill makes i could be wrong on that umi'm five feet tall just for reference154 centimetersand these are a size extra smallwhich is apparently a us46these leggings are really great they'rehigh-waisted i love them i've had themfor a really long time and they're inpretty much like perfect solid conditionthe only thing that's not great um idon't know if you can tellbut this little part on the bum has someyellowing where like the white polkadots areum that happened recently actuallybecause i do jujitsu and we werechanging over the floor matsand when we were doing a nogi class iwore these leggingsand uh the matsstained the polka dots which isunfortunatebut not the worst thing in the worldthey're still great condition i can justwear them with a slightly longer shirtthe next pair of leggings is alsoa pair of adidas leggings once againtheseare quite old to the point where theydon't make them anymorei'm gonna guess that these ones i've hadfor around seven yearsonce again clima light material theseare alsofull length the only thing i don't likeabout them is that they're nothigh waisted which is to be expectedconsidering the fact that they're sevenyears old and high-waisted wasn't ashuge of a thing back theni will only wear them with longer shirtsthough just becauselike i said they are not high-waistedwhich kind of sucksadidas leggings though are clearly verygood quality because i've had both ofthose for over half a decadeand i put them in the washing machineand the dryer and they're both stillin quite good condition the next pair ofleggings i have is actually the onlypair of nikeleggings i own i remember my mom got methese these have thisfun pattern which i will admit though idon't think the pattern is the cutestthing when you just look at iton the leggings but when they're on yourbody i think the patternlooks a lot cuter these ones are croppedi don't wear cropped leggings very oftenbut sometimes you know you just need toshow off a little bit of calfi don't know one thing i like aboutthese they're high-waistedwhich is always cute they do havea um a drawstring like if you folddown the top but i don't understandbecause if you fold down the top you cansee the tag and everything andyeah so i'm not really sure what thepurpose of that is once againi've probably had these forfive six years um and they've held upquite well overall though i'm just notlike a huge nike fan soyeah this is the only pair of nikeleggings i ownso i'm actually realizing right now thatmost of the leggings i haveare single contenders likejust one pair for the brand except forof course the adidas and then jim sharkgymsharkis where most of my leggings are from soour next one is a single contenderthese are a pair of deodora leggingsthey're this likeplum color heathered full length leggingonce againhigh-waisted i like that i have no ideawhat size these are the tag has beencompletely worn off once againi've had these ones seven years maybeso i don't know what size they are i'mgonna guess their size smallbecause most leggings i wear a sizesmall in length is greatum once again it goes a bit past myankle but that doesn't bother methe only caveat with them is that theycan get quite warmum they're like a thickermaterial and the insidethe closest thing i could compare it towould be likea very thin solar fleece almost is whatthe inside feels likethey can get pretty warm so this nextpair of leggings is fromold navy activewear old navy leggingsare actuallypretty good i do think i own a couplemore pairs fromold navy but i think they're back at myparents housethey're these like color blocked fulllength once againum as you can tell i prefer full lengthleggings overcropped or 7 8 7 8 what7 8 length high waisted which i loveand old navy leggings are pretty goodqualityand quite affordable compared toa lot of other brands once again justlike all the other leggings i've shownso farthese are so old that this particularleggingis no longer sold i'm sorry heythey last so you know they lastand i like them and i wear them so whywouldn't i keep themnext up is the only pair of airyleggings that i own and i dowish that i owned more airy leggingsbecause i hear they'regreat and the pair that i own i doreally likebut once again this pair is kind of oldthis pair is probably six years old andi'veheard that arie has stepped up theirlegging game like even more in the pastcouple of years so iwould be interested to try some of theirmore recent ones they're thesecute like once again kind of a heatheredgreen kind of situationbut then they have this interestingpanel down the side of the leg that'slikeit always kind of reminds me of adinosaur like backyou know what i mean very cutehigh-waistedvery comfortable but still keeps youkind of containedfull length length once againas always a little bit past my ankle nobig dealprobably just at the ankle if you are aperson ofaverage height similar to the deodorantones they do kind of have that likemore f solar fleecy feeling on theinsideso these ones can get quite warm as wellso if it's like a hot day i'm notwearing these leggings but in the winterin a cold dance studio yeah for sureokay so now we're moving into gymsharkwhich ismost of the leggings um which is a goodthing though because now instead of mesayingsorry these leggings are so old youcan't even buy them anymore these onesareall still available or most of them arestill availablei'm quite sure most of them are so allof the gym shark leggings i wear i weara sizesmall which is interesting becausedespite it being one branddepending on the style of leggingthe smalls can sometimes be a bit toobig on me or a bit too long it'sinteresting we'll talk about it thefirst pair hereis the vital seamless once againfull length they're not high waisted butthey're notlow rise either i'd say they're amid-rise i dothink that they're advertised as beinghigh-waisted butthey're not so don't let that trick youso i have the samestyle the fit seamless in a differentcolorum i adore this color once again fulllengthsize small love them um these are bothsquat proofall the leggings i have mentioned so farare squat proof so that's not somethingyou need to worry about but once againwhy would you care about the first onesbecause you can't even buy themanywho love these nice lightweightmaterialyou don't get like super sweaty in themthey're great not with these ones butwith the blackpair they have gotten a bit of likepilling aroundthe knee area which isn't a huge deal umbut it's just interesting that it's onlyhappened to the black pair as opposed tothis pair and i'd say i wearand wash this pair more so that's justinteresting another thing about thevitalfit leggings is that they have thisclear kind of like rubberized texturearound the waist that way they don'tfall down as easilywhich is really really nice because weall know it's no funhiking your leggings up these next feware allvariations on the gym shark trainingleggingslike that line um and interestinglyenough these are jim shark's mostaffordable leggingsi'm pretty sure and of all of my gymshark leggings i would say they are myfavorite in terms offit qualityfeel just everything ireally really love this line thatgymshark has so first off i havea pair and i believe the color is calledtaupei guess this is taupe i don't know ithas a little bit more purple in it thani would say taupe does but whateverthese ones are full length all of thetraining leggings arehigh-waisted which i love once againsquat proof and the thing that i reallyreally like about these leggingsis how soft they are they're verybreathablebut they're also so soft like when youhave freshly shaved legs and you put apair of these leggings on likechef's kiss amazing really like thesesuper cute same style just in adifferent colorthese are called red but i meanthat's clearly orange so there's like atraffic cone and a traffic cone is notred a traffic coneis orange but i digresswonderful feeling love the fit loveeverything about themlengthwise they fall like just a smidgejust a smidge below my ankle whichi'm cool with if you're once again ofaverage heightthey'll probably fall at the ankle sothis one is a variation on the trainingleggings in the sensethat these ones are the seven eighthseven eighths length seventh eightsevenths eighths 78 slang is what length these ones areum and i'd say it comes a little bitbelowthe bottom of my calf um i don't knowthey don't go all the way down butthey're definitely not crapped i don'tknowyeah you'll see the b-roll of themwhatever and i just lovelove this color this is such a prettypink ithink they're super cute they're softyou already heard me say all that stuffokay i think that this might be myfavorite pair of leggings i ownonce again gymshark training leggingsthese ones are slightly varied in thesensethat they have a mesh panel down theside and they also havea pocket on the side which isamazing very very softsoft material that is also just likethisgreat like sweat wicking fabric but thatdoesn't like retainstench love them i think these might bemy favorite onesi really like the way they look on can'trecommend them enoughthese ones i actually got recentlybecause my friend is a really big fanof the vital rise collection fromgymshark soi thought i would give these ones a tryi have this redpair once again they're kind of leaningtowards orange but on the websitethey're called redfull length they have this like moralpattern and then down the side of thelegit has a line which kind of elongatesthe leg i supposeand then under the bum it has these likehorizontal lines which i guess aresupposed to make your bum look moreliftedi'm not sure if that's the case you tellme in the footage i don't knowreally really thick waistband on thesebad boyshigh-waisted thick waistband the onlyissue for me and i think this might justbe because i'm shortis that sometimes the waistband falls ata strangeplace where it kind of displaces mymy tummy in a funny way so that itlike pokes out a little bit more at thebottom than i wouldlike but i mean that's what tummies looklike sowhat you gonna do about it they are aslightly thicker materialthan the training leggings they're notquite assilky maybe they're slightly morecottonyperhaps i don't know but i still reallylike themso much so that i have the same onesjust in the navy and gray same situationwith theweird butt panel i don't know theseleggings i think are such a pretty colorbut they don't fit me as well as i wishthey did they are called the dreamy meshleggingsum and i think these might be the onlyones fromgymshark that i'm showing here thataren't sold anymoremaybe i'm not sure they're this gorgeouscolor they have this meshchanneling they have pockets which isgreatfull length however unlike all the otherfull length ones i have these ones arequite long on me like they can gohalfway down my footum so i usually just wear them and theykind of scrunch so similar to the lastpair ishowed these ones do fall kind of at aweird spot on me i think once again itis because of the lengththat the waist does kind of push mytummy in a funny way sometimes um butlike i said beforethat's what tummies do so yeah okay sonext from gymshark we havethese leggings which i think are sofun because they are the most obnoxiousshade of pink ever which i lovethese are just hilariously pinkit's amazing i love them they are fulllengthsame with all the other ones size smallthese ones fallin a great spot on my anklejust slightly below the ankle these aresuper cute and i love themthe one downfall and i will say gymsharkdoes actuallyadvertise this on their website underthe description for these leggingsthese are not squat proof you can evensee in the b-roll likei was wearing like nude coloredunderwear and you could still see themthrough these leggingsso unfortunately these are a pair thatonly get wornwith really long tops which is kind ofsad becausei personally think they make my behindlook pretty decentbut i digress so the very last pair ofleggings i have here ijust ordered from gymshark if i'mcompletely honest with you i wanted theshorts versionof this but the shorts were all sold outand i'm impatient so i went with theleggingsthey are the new power collection ibelieve it's calledfull length i have the light bluepattern same thingsize small these are super cute i was alittle bitapprehensive because this has the bumscrunchyou know that like is all over tick tockand everything the bum scrunchi was a little bit apprehensive aboutthatbut i'm not gonna complain about it ikind of like the way it looks in termsof material these are supersuper similar to the training leggingsthe materialis like the same thickness the samefeeling maybe not quite as softbut super breathable love them i haveonly gotten to wear thesetwice but both times i've gottencompliments on them and i think they'resuper cuteso yeah maybei will be foolish and spend money on theshorts version when those go back instockall right thank you so much for watchingthis video i hope you enjoyed it give mea thumbs up if you were like me andleggings are part of your literal dailyattireum and i don't know tell gymshark thatthey shouldlike pay me because i just advertise forthem for free for likehowever long this video is anywaythanks so much for watching i will seeyou guys in the next onebye[Music]i've only gotten to wear them twice

the term vision these days seems to beassociated with material things andlifestyle goals our vision when we gotstarted wasn't a tangible thing youcould touch it was a feeling and amotivation to inspire and change of gameluckily there was a couple guys over inEngland with a similar vision we gottogether in three years later we changedthe game and we're loving everysecond of ityouso it all started for me when I gotdumped by my seventh-grade girlfriendshe handed me a note and we were readingit on the bench finished the note andwhile I was still sad this bully came upribbed up right in front of me thatsummer I decided that I was going tocome back into the eighth gradecompletely different I knew that Iwanted to get abs specifically just ABSI didn't know I I didn't know I couldwork out my other muscles I just wantedsome abs and I knew that I thought thatI'd probably get more girlfriends thatway and every single night the entiresummer when my parents thought I wasasleep I just be my bedroom listening tothis like six-minute abs CD and justdoing the routine eventually I'vememorized the routine I didn't have tolisten to the CD anymore I would justlisten to music I remember that samesong I know exactly how it sounds andevery night I just do my ABS I came backin eighth grade and of course ABS hadnothing to do with me getting more girlsI just become more confident and I didget some more girlfriends but in eighthgrade nothing really happens of courseyou know going into high school I neverreally realized how kind of out of shapeI was until I got a reality check andthat came in junior year so 11th gradewhen my buddy Brock he was thelinebacker for the varsity football teamfrom my high school and you know justone of the best players he's gonna playball in the college and all that so hewas a buddy of mine in math class and hejust persuaded me to go try out forfootball you know I was kind ofintimidated I knew you know you neededto be stronger and faster and reallyathletic to play football so at first Ijust said no no way you know I don'twant to try that because I had neverlooked it away in my life or anythingand from there he you know he persuadedme so I just said you know what let's doit I went out I remember one or two daysin they were actually doingtesting on the players to see whatplayers max max benchpress max watts andmax bodyweight dips were just to have abenchmark you know for to compare tofrom the beginning of the season um soeverybody started warming up you knowbench-pressing 95 pounds just doing afew reps getting ready for their one repmax attempt and I remember seeing itlike Oh everyone's doing this is prettyeasy it's got to be easy even though Ihad never done it so I hopped on and Iremember unrack in 95 pounds and itliterally buckled my elbows and itcrushed me and almost crushed my sternumin and they had to come and pull the baroff me and it was terrible as a badexperience I was like wow I'm really notbuilt for this and at that point is whenI realized this weight training stuffman this is not for me you know thesefootball guys are on another level anddespite it being a reality checkkind of in a negative way that Irealized it wasn't as strong as I wantedto be or anywhere near as strong as evenany of these other kids it it definitelyand literally built a fire under my assthat I've never had in my life beforeand I didn't really know it at the timebut that that is what sparked everythingso fast-forward to sophomore year Istarted a weight training class I wasreally fortunate that in this weighttraining class we were taught how toproperly how to live safely and duringthat year I gained 20 pounds a basicallypure muscle and same with the next yearum I really had no idea where I wantedto get my physique I honestly justwanted to improve every single day justget stronger every single day you knowthe little money I had saved up you knowin high school I decided to know whatI'm gonna put it towards my first gymmembership so I went to a local gymsigned up for my membership and thatsummer my summer vacation from schoolwas about three months old saying about90 days for those 90 days withoutmissing a single day so seven days aweek I do abs and biceps for an hour anda half every day seven days a week andrun on the treadmill so that wasliterally my routine seven days a weekfor three months was treadmill abs andbiceps and that's all I knew I literallydid nothing elseso after lifting about four or fiveyears I decided I wanted to startputting myself out there on YouTube it'scrazy because what I began there wasnobody else doing what I was doingnowadays you have just tons and tons ofpeople that you can follow on InstagramYouTube and so on and there's so manydifferent models that you can follow andyou could aspire to become like them youknow that there's money in it now youcan see it physically people with theircars or clothes and so on you know thatyou can make a ton of money I had noidea what the money looked like if therewas any I just wanted to give peoplevalue for freeif something came from that and gave meback money or whatever awesome that'scool but yeahgood morning ladies and gents it is veryearly we are off to Lake Tahoe theworld-famous Lake Tahoe at the end ofthe snowboarding season to get somesnowboarding in some of us haven't evendone it but we're excited to go out andkill itso let's get ittowards the end of 2012 was when legendsof aesthetics was created we startedthis move this new movement to starteducating people on some science basedapproaches to the Tricia and trainingthe collaboration was strong it wasstill early in the whole understandingof you know macro I mean would you sayit was even recognized at that pointstill the macro thing I was still isearly age nicheyes very small still so our you know ourvision was to really global eyes it andin the meantime we had two people acrossthe globe with a similar vision ofchanging the game in a slightlydifferent way well yeah so typicallywith a fitness company whether it'ssupplements or clothing or whatever itwould be the typical thing to advertiseor to bring awareness that company is tojust hire you know or was to just hirethe most jacked attract their popularyeah you know the IFBB pros and mr.Olympia is hire them and then have themadvertise so we didn't have you know anybig expectations or anything we didn'tknow what to expect when we went to theUK for the first body power 2013 we werejust happy to do it you know travelinginternationallymeeting a new group of people you knowso I'm Matt now you know super goodfriends figured hey why not we're tryingto change the game wanna travelinternational stoked stoked you know anddo our thing I remember we even made ourown like no crush a gym session and Idid like some cool build up for the expofor that just a bunch of promotion andbut still just looking at it as you knowwith an open mind just going out thereto just have fun and kill it and seewhat we make good but we had never beento a fitness expo before so we reallydidn't expect to see what we saw youwere that it was crazy like they openedthe doors it was like the floodgatesjust open and at first we were like ohcool the doors open and then all of asudden we were like surrounded and itwas like this many people know us it'slike the Running of the Bulls in Spaineventually eventually people were likedude I'm going to use my British accentyou know queue was longer than my grainsit was like humbly we enjoyed it werejust actually regular dudes fromCalifornia who made a few YouTube videosyeah yeah I think I think that's thatwas the realization that you know thosenumbers are actually people with livesand then that's when we came to termswith wow like those people exist andthey're here you know so it was just ait was just literally madness I rememberthe two owners were there sweatingbullets just trying to sell as fast aspossible so this clothing the clothesjust flying off the racks we keep inmind you know these guys this startedthis or even younger than us they wereunder 20 years old less than 20 yearsold it's it's like crazy to see just howmany people are now following some ofthe things that you know we've beenpreaching to last few years thescience-based nutrition and training andeveryone's making histogram profiles andstarting our little fitness journeys andcompetitions and building up theirsubscribers in YouTube and everyone'sputting a lot of work it's really coolit's inspiring to see and one of mostcommon things I get is like Matt how dohow do I build something just likeyou've built and I really don't want toanswer that because Iwant that person to try to be Who I amand build what I've built or to try toemulate and build what Jim sharks builtbecause that's what they did and whatyou're going to do is completelydifferent perhaps so again it's notabout you trying to be Matt Obus it'snot about you trying to be Chris Lovatoyou trying to be you know the people whostarted Jim shark you have to understandwhat it is that really makes you happyyou know something that that drives youto work without worrying about what it'sgoing to get you in the future you knowit should be something that makes youhappy nowwhatever ends up getting you whereverthat takes you it doesn't matter butchances are it's going to be goodbecause you're going to be happy doingit along the waythat's the most important thing you knownot not having mass vision not having myvision having your vision

likeI'm inside just breadtwo hours laterbe patientyouhey guys I really wanted to do avoiceover for this vlog I apologize forit being so late I think jasmineuploaded hers like a month ago so if youwant to see her version of this day youcan go check out her channel it's linkeddown below I think it was like 5 to 10videos ago on her channel probably sothis was a really fun day this ishonestly like the top two or three mostfun days of the entire LA trip for me itwas kind of it's just super fun like wehad the Jim Shrek photo shoot in themorningand then I kind of just hung out withNicky and jasmine and they were twopeople that I was really looking forwardto spending some time with in LA so itwas perfect that we got together for theJim Shrek think so jasmine and I kind ofjust hung out the rest of the day weended up training you can see theworkout here we would have saw kind ofthe beginning of it but this is thefirst time that I did a powerliftingstyle workout in probably well I did theDead live at past week but for actualformal powerlifting slashed like powerlifts that wasn't since probably July oreven June of last year so it's almostbeen an entire year since I've donepowerlifting style training I wouldrandomly do like low bar squats here andthere but I haven't really touchedactual powerless in forever so this iskind of fun getting into that I'm likeat the point where I'm comfortable doinglike bench press and overhead pressagain I had a lot of fun doing husband'sworkout I actually had planned to do alower body day this day so yeah it takesa lot for me to be convinced not to do alittle body day not like jasmine put anypressure on me but I was like you knowwhat I rarely will ever get a chance totrain with jasmine and at a really coolgym that's like perfect for filming andfor powerlifting so I was like let's doit and it ended up being super fun myupper body was toast for an entire weekafterwards though um yeah like Icouldn't lift my arms it's really badand I completely blame Jasmine no justkiddingbut um I was like pretty beat up upperbody wise and I think the reason forthatis because I'm used to doing like firstof all I don't do a lot of pressingmovements and second of all I do dohigher rep ranges and I find either waylike if I'm used to doing strengthtraining and then I do like a high repworkout and then if I'm used to doingreally high rep ranges and I do kind oflike a strength day then I will getreally sore the repeated bout if thatworks if I am training like reallysimilar volume I guess if that makessenseum this day was really good I had thephoto shoot I had the awesome trainingsession with jasmine then it was Emily'slike she was given a free meal you guyswill see that coming up here honestly Iget excited but like I don't get reallyexcited but I actually twerked anddanced and screamed when Emily told meshe got a free meal because I was soexcited for it and I was also excitedfor me because I didn't really get toeat like type food the entire trip justbecause like it just wouldn't havereally made sense to you becauseeveryone was prepping and I didn't wantto always be the only fatty so yeah itwas just a good day like it was goodafter the workout jazz and I met up withEmily you'll see that coming up and yeahso that's pretty much it I just want tosay that jasmine is the most chilldown-to-earth person I have ever metpossibly other than Jeff Jeff is areally chill easygoing person you knowlike I just found it really easy to hangout with her and she's just an easyperson to be around so I was when you'rereally cool and I'm glad that

[Music]what's up guys and welcome back to mychannel sorry for sounding a littlenasally today I'm a little bit sick alsojust chopped off like all of my hairthis is the shortest it's been since Iwas like six years old so super excitingand this say my forehead I explained inmy giveaway video also I'm running agiveaway right now so if you want toenter that go just go see my last videoand give it an enter basin ship sharkand little em'ly involved so probablywant to go do that but anyway this videois a review of Jim sharks new camoseamless collection they actually wasn'tgoing to order this but then like twodays passed and I like was just likecouldn't stop thinking about it and itwas so pretty so I just hadn't orderedit and I got it in the jade green sagegreen color and it is so prettyspoiler alert guys I love this set Iwill ask always be totally honest withyou guys in this video on any thingsthat I find wrong with the set this isnot sponsored I'm not the Joe sharpathlete so there's no reason why I wouldbe promoting this product if I didn'tactually like it so let's I starttalking about it first things first theprices so this is something that reallybothered me because this is the mostexpensive gym shark set there is to dateI mean sorry if I'm wrong on that butfrom my experience the most expensiveleggings that I purchase on Jim shark inthe past were $55 and I believe that'sthe energy seamless and the flawlessknit which I did a review of but theseleggings are these cameras use leggingsare $60 and these are US dollars I knowthat in different countries differentprices so sorry about that but if you'refrom the US the leggings are $60 and thesports bra is $45 and I think the top isalso $45 so if you want to get the fullset you're nearing about $150 and I justthat's just a lot of money a lot of youguys have been asking for Dukes for thisand I will be doing a new video comingup but these are super expensive but youare if you are willingto invest in some activewear I do thinkthese are very high quality but it is alittle upsetting that Jim shark keepsraising their prices because I mean Ithink that flex liking sorry the $30range in 30 to 40 of these are 16 sothat's a lot of money the cameraseamless collection has the leggings thesports bras and the long-sleeve croptops so there are no like full-lengthshirt options if you don't like showingany stomach at the gym for us tallpeople wearing a crop top and leggingscan still be showing a lot of torso soif you don't like to show any torso thenthis collection doesn't have like a fullcherie option for you the colors arelavender gray sage green which I haveand then black so talking about theleggings so in the material of theseleggings I'm just gonna read it becauseI don't feel like memorizing it's anylon polyester a lot of same blend andthe bio seamless and energy seamlessalso by Jim shark are also nylonpolyester a lot same blends butdifferent percentages so it isdefinitely a different material and iflink feels like a different materialthis is definitely one of Jim sharkslike thicker fabrics compared to theflawless knit which was like paper thinbut still actually mostly squat proofthese are definitely super thick thewaistband is super thick it feels likemore like a winter and leggings puttingit on I don't know if like that like itlooks like anything but like so youcould tell it's like a stickit's definitely a big fabric let me gocompare it to that ombre and it's likelet's compare some waist bands so ifyou're wondering how the waist bandscompared to others in terms of heightI'd say that looks pretty darn closeokay so it's the same height this is thecamo and this is a Jim shark ombreseamless and the waist bands are theexact same height so if you are lookingfor the same high-rise as an energyseamless by the way these do hit meabout like right above my belly buttonas you see in the video but the waistbands are different this is the ombreseamless and the ribbing is slightlymore spread out and you can also seeit's just like a thinner more flimsywaist band to be honest I really don'tlike the Jim shark ombre seamlesswaistband but this waistband as you cansee Debhas a little more thickness to it alittle more structure the ribbing iscloser together see farther closertogether and I justI trust that these would not stretch outas much as the hombre seamless that it'svery flimsy and in terms of the vitalseamless the waistband okay this iswhere the waistband starts so it is thetiniest bit shorter than the gym sharkvital seamless waistband but as you cansee the ribbing is a little closer thisis more closely ribbed and this is alsoclosely ribbed but it also it looksthicker as you can see it looks like aslightly thicker waistband it definitelyfeels a lot thicker then the vitalseamless waistband which I also don'tload the vital seamless waistband thatthis waistband feels really good so it'sthicker more compressive and it's notgoing to stretch out as much in terms offabrics I really it's definitely notlike the vital seamless if I allseamless has a very slick texture almostand so we'll just get rid of that one interms of material composition the camout and the hombre seamless are verysimilar but if you hear let's see alittle close-up this so this is a Morrowtexture and this I can't it's hard totell but tomorrow because it is camo butit really doesn't look like marl and itfeels more cottony than the hombreseamless for sure so definitely more ofa cottony texture so the most similarfabric to the camo seamless is the gymshark flex but I feel like it is stillthicker than the gym truck flex the Flexis a pretty thick fabric but I reallyfeel like the camo is thicker than thatso it's more like a winter legging butin terms of like rut you know rubbingyour fingers along it how does itactually feel the gym shark flex is theclosest fabric to the camo seamless forsuresometimes the Flex can be a littleflimsy this is definitely thicker so itwill give you a little more shape forsure also for the seams I'm a dancer soI need to be able to stretch andeverything and these seams felt verystretchy some other Jim shark seams canbe really annoying and like very stiffbut use actually felt very stretchy andit just has thatsimple little gusset crotch in casey'all were wondering via the seams aresuper stretchy in diapersit definitely has somewhat of acompression feel but in the waistbandwhere it's super thick I feel like awhole doing really well but I didn'tfeel like it squished my butt at allwhich is pretty rare for like acompression to my game I feel like alittle like bootie contour detail alsohelps with thatbut I really didn't feel like I was likelike being squished down it also didn'tshow any cellulite which is great so Ifeel like these are very thick like eggsand they hide imperfections very welland like hold you in where you want tobe held in but I didn't feel like mybutt was like squished down which I knowthat is a pet peeve of mine and someother of you guys as well in compared tothe flawless net which I just reviewedthese definitely hide things a lotbetter like you could not really seeunderwear lines you couldn't seecellulite you couldn't see like I don'tknow if anyone else has that little likedouble but you know it's like a littlecrease and I mean he's not pleased we'rejust gonna be real right now thathappens to some of us and that you can'tsee that on these leggings but I believeyou could on the othersthese come in size extra small to largelike almost everything else Jim shark Iwear a size small and everything Jimshark and he's fit exactly like anyother small so I say definitely true tosize the waistband is ribbed so it'sbasically a very similar waistband to alot of other generic leggings but itfeels a little more structured like andI haven't worn it for long enough totell if it's going to stretch out butfor some reason I feel like it's notgoing to stretch out because it's notthe same fabric as the hombre seamlesswhich they do stretch out like nothingelse and I could see a little bit ofstretching out with these they alsodon't have that top band it's theclassic the classic Jewish arc waistband very flattering but I could seethese stretching out a little bit butthey have not stretched out for me yetasks for the details as you can see theJim shark logo on these is very subtlewhich I love I sometimes feel like Jimshark really like over logos but you cansee it's just like it's very subtly inthe fabric like it's it's it's notraised or anything they literally justwroteshark-like within the cama which i thinkis so cool like a really really gooddesign idea for them and for the firsttime ever I think they have a bootyscrunch and this isn't like a bootyscrunch that's like wow those leggingsaren't up her butt you know it's likeit's so subtle and it's like it's onlyabout like an inch in length and it'sreally just made by like a bunch oflittle like it looks like embroider IIstitches it looks like little embroiderystitches and sometimes with the seamlesslegging your butt could kind of get likelost in it just because it's just likeahit adds no definition or anything andthis kind of just like brings it in andit's like okay her butt is still theremaybe that's part of the reason why Ididn't compress my butt because likethey have this little stitching and itreally helps like enhance but from faraway it doesn't look like it's bootyscrunch butt wouldn't like but it lookslike you have more like definition inyour butt not just like Yuna but youknow I'm saying not just like one monthand the camo is very delicate and I feltlike they chose good colors so it's notlike a bright green with like a reallylight color it's like all around likevery subtle I feel like from very faraway you might not even know it's camobut I really like how they designed thecamo and it's not like that pixel IIlike military camo it's more of like asmooth like I don't know they're kind ofblobs you see what it is you see andthey also have a little ribbed bottom ofthe legging and these are a full-lengthon me I'm five nine but I have a longertorso as of course that's opposed tolegs in these hit just about like rightabove my little ankle joint thing thatmake sense but totally full-length on meso there's a squat crudeness I feel likeit's hard to tell almost because of thecamo it kind of like this proof I don'tknowbut looking at the video of me andsquatting I'd say they're like I get alook at 9n attends I give it like a 9out of 10 squat richness I feel likethere's like a tiny bit of Sheernesswhat do you like really are leaning overbut it's like not too bad but for themost part I'd say these areand you should feel comfortable going tothe gym in these you're not gonna seeanything I was wearing like a similarcolored underwear to this but I reallycouldn't see anything in my squad testin terms of camel toe I feel like theseleggings are so much thicker than likean ombre seamless that they'recamouflages the camel toe a lot betterthis you still do you still do get alittle bit of like the single camel butyou're definitely not getting any doublecamel which is very important I feellike that's the worst kind of camel toeit's hard to take it like the doublecamel sometimes when you have a seamlesslegging because there's no like seamgoing up there you know but there'sdefinitely still a little bit but I saythese are probably the best Jim sharkleggings to date that have camouflagethe camel toe just because the fabric isso thick and sweat proof I can't imagineyou'd notice really any sweat in theseunless you are like really really sweatybut because of the camouflage like ifyou were going to sweat a little bitit'll probably just blend into the camoeffect you know like it'll just looklike one of the darker like darkerblotches instead of one of the lighterblotches so if you're a nice sweatyperson I feel like these would be goodbecause you could really you could getreally get away with a lot of sweat withnot very many people noticing justbecause of both just because of thedesign and to these sports grass so thesports bra is the same material as theleggings it has this cute little like Idon't know what you'd call this but kindof like a little fold over like rap rapleg effect in the front and in the backit has this like I don't know what youwould call this but kind of like alittle keyhole design they really put alot of thought into the design of thisbra I think it's like really unique interms of a sports bra instead of justlike a regular sports bra but if we likeI felt like that is another story aboutthat but those are the details and italso says Jim shark very subtly likeengraved in the fabric like not raisedor anything in the back tomb and then ithas the tiny little shark logo on thefront which they probably could havedone without because they have this butyeah those are the details of the sportsbra and they also haveribbing at the bottom of the sports bramuch like the waistband of the leggingso I really thought this would be likezero support at all because most jimtransports bras are absolutely zero supportbut this I actually would say this onethis is a medium support it is likethere's still some jiggling going on butI felt more supported than like a gymshark ombre seamless sports bra which islike really nothing nothing to bragabout let's talk for a moment about yoursharks sports bras shall we I feel likea lot of the gym shark athletes who arethe primary reviewers of the gym sharkGoods like because they get the gymshark items early they don't they canreview everything before people buythose people watch they'll often saythat gym shark is like a look like likea medium support but most of thesepeople have either breast implants orreally small chests which is fine but Ifeel like if the average bra size in theUnited States at least the average cupsize is a double D I just feel likethey're not really catering to allaudiences I do have a larger chest and Imostly don't even bother with gym sharksports bras I really got this just forthe review and I plan on returning itbecause it's not something I can wear tothe gym if you have a larger chest thisshows a lot like there was spillage outto the side there's a lot of cleavage itreally felt like a push-up bra and Ijust don't feel comfortable going to thegym and showing that much cleavage andthat much is my body if you want to dothat that it's like totally go you but Ireally don't feel comfortable like ohI'll wear a sports front of the gym butI really don't want there to be likemajor cleavage I feel like that's justlike not what I want to do and also mostof gyms export routes are so low supportthey have seriously like one line ofsupportive sports bras so everythingelse is like you can't what you can'thave a supportive sports bra to matchwith your gym sharks at because theydon't make them for women with largerchest which just really bothers me orlike maybe for a collection for one soyou don't make like a spaghetti strapsports bra and you make like something alittle more supportive or it'shaving removable pads uuk build the padinto the bra so I really wish Jim sharkwould start making their bras a littlemore like inclusive to women of allchest sizes and and stop doing theremovable pads and actually like putpads in that's my rant on ginger sportsbras the pass on this didn't bother mequite as much as some of the other gymshark paths but I don't obviously butsince this material is a more sturdythicker material than a lot of other gymshark fabrics it did provide a littlemore support I also got this in a smallI don't know if I mentioned I gotta geta small and everything I also got thisin a small and because of that it reallyjust like squished my boobs down which Ifeel like is why I was able to give somesupport if I got a medium I don't thinkthat this would be supportive at all butjust keep it in mind if you have alarger test you will be showing a lot ofcleavage in this and if you're not downfor that maybe just get the long-sleevedtop instead but you have a smaller chestor you want to show some cleavage go forthis bra because it's actually I it'ssuper cute and I wish that I was able towear it I have I definitely have friendswho would look amazing in this and a lotof people would look amazing in this soif you were in that boat I'd say thisfourth bra is definitely super cute andI really don't have any other complaintsabout it I think it's a super uniquedesign and I haven't really seen anyother sports bras like this so yeah thatis basically all I have to say about thegym sharkcam a seamless set I got thismostly to review but I really want tokeep it looking so cutebut I have a lot of gym clothes also alot of you guys think I have like somany dingy clothes but I returned likehalf of things that I buy or I sell themso I really don't have as many as youthink but I will make a liking videocollection by collection video coming upsoon because I know then I love you wantto see that yes don't forget

raise your hand if you've ever been apersonally victimized by Jim charin case you haven't heard Jim shark hasa new release so of course I ran intothe computer three minutes later Iblacked out and all of us showed up atmy door like three days later I thoughtI would get festive and where am I Jimshark hoodie for my joke video this isactually still on the website it'sreally really cute peep that back detailnice and open good just like fall hoodiewhere it's like not super hot yet butalso not cold super stylish I like it alot and it still moves out which isawesomejust realized I should probablyintroduce myself my name is Shayla I'm afitness professional who has a littleaddiction to active wear my husbandmight say big addiction okay so Iordered the amplifi seamless and thenthe vital seamless and then I believethis is part of the vital seamless aswell a long sleeved part of it so ifyou've ever tried to order from gymshark in the past with new launchesthey're kind of known for their newlaunches selling out in like threeminutesI've had some launches where I've gotteneverything I wanted I've had somelaunches where I've gotten some of whatI wanted and then some were likeeverything is sold out and I'm alwaysthere like when it opens like with it onmy screen refreshing and sometimes it'sjust like you can't check out fastenough stuffs just gone so really coolthing and why I wanted to review thisspecifically is they silently restockedthese the day after they launched so allof this stuff I'm talking about it'sstill in stock except the croppedseamless sorrykeep checking because Jim shark doessilently restock they don't announcewhen there are restocking so just keepchecking and when they do restock you'realmost certain to get it because no onetypically knows about it so let's startwith the vital seamless long sleeve croptop in the legging set I got mine in asize small both pieces and it's thesteel blue floral colorI love love love this color it's veryflattering especially for blonde hairblue just always looks really goodit is high-waisted not quite ashigh-waisted as the amplifi and oh mygoshit does wonders for the booty your bootywill be looking fabulous this set doesshow a little bit more of your midriffthen at the amplifi set does so so thevital seamless as well as the amplifyside they're very tight like compressiontype material so if you don't like yourstuff super tight I would definitelysize up one thing I do want to noteabout these is said that they were goingto be fixing the camel toe issue andthat a lot of the past leggings have hadand I do think they did with both ofthese leggings I didn't notice anythingI checked to make sure moving on to thelong sleeve vital seamless long sleeveshirt because it's not the crop I gotthis in the tell our blush new tomorrowsuper pretty color this is also a sizesmall but it is very very tight I feellike it is tighter than the crop set sothe sizing is a little inconsistent inmyand I probably could have done mediumand all three of these pieces and beenfine by definitely needed a medium andthis it doesn't really look that bad butin person it just feels very very tightI could probably get away with thissmall but I think I would be morecomfortable in the medium but this topis super super pretty I think the coloris probably a flattering color for mostpeople most hair colors so can't reallygo wrong with it it's just really a goodstaple piece to have vital seamless longsleeve flush new tomorrow and smallthat's a mouthful okay so moving on tomy personal favorite purchase of thishaul the amplified seamless set this setis really really awesome okay the coloris light green moral slash sea green myfavorite part about this is me what isthat called contouring the contouringunderneath the boob area and thenthe bum or no I'm sorryabove the bum so it's different I'venever really seen anything like this andit is definitely flattering I wasn'tsure how I would feel about it but justwanted to try it and my husband Alexeven said something when I first triedit on he was like wow don't really makeme a bum look good and I was like okaythese are staying if he's gonna make acomment about it because I neverhappened these do go a little sheerwhenever you squat in them but it's notI don't think it's that noticeable andbecause it's a gray it almost just lookslike it could be the material so I don'tthink it's bad at all I personally wouldprobably still spot in it it doesn'tbother me but keep that in mind it doesgo a little sheer at the bottom of thesquat so in conclusion really happy withreally everything I bought except I justwish that I would have done a medium inthe long sleeve vital seamlesseverything else worked out really nicelyI would recommend them if you're in themarket for a snazzy crop top highwaisted leggings set they're really cuteI like them I recommend I can't reallygo wrong with a company that has reallygood customer service if you order andyou don't like it you can always returnit that is going to conclude my reviewthank you so much for watching if youhave any suggestions for anythat you would like to see reviewedleave me a comment down below I wouldlove to review them I have some ideasbut there are a lot of brands out thereso give me some suggestions and thanksfor watchingI'll see you in the next one bye why dothey make these

UNSPONSORED,PzmhnoIDLds,42266
hey guys and welcome back to my channeltoday I am reviewing a bunch of stufffrom Jim sharks new a Legacy Collectionand they're like laser cut collectionwhich is another collection they justlike didn't hype at all I haven't seenlike a single post about these but I'mgonna review them anywaysometimes Jim shark has some hidden gemssometimes they have some reallyquestionable things I actually waspretty excited for their LegacyCollection because it's kind of likethey're old-school Jim shark logobasically this is kind of like a littlesneak peek I think it usually says Jimshark fitness but it kind of cuts off inthe sports bra and it's like a sharkthat has like major biceps I can'trelate they have a lot of really reallycute items I don't think this is one oftheir really like out there launcheslike recently I'm really excited for thesweatshirts and sweat shorts kind ofstyle I think that's like really like ohgee Jim shark honestly these things arestill kind of up there in the normal Jimshark price range and you would havethought maybe since they're kind ofgoing like old school Jim shark logomaybe they would have gone old schoolJim shark prices like $30 for leggingsand stuff but it's still like 45 to 50okay without further ado oh let's justget started so the first item I want totalk about are their legacy fitnesspanel leggings these were $45 and theseare the only pair of leggings in thecollection I believe they say right onthe website to size up if you want yournormal gym check fit but then the modelon the websites wearing an extra smallshe's like you usually wearing an extrasmall so I don't know I got a medium itdoesn't look like it's gonna be too bigon methe fabric is kind of interesting theysay that this is a performance leggingmeant for lifting the fabric isdefinitely pretty cottony it's alreadystarted to collect some lint has a fewfuzzies on it and I could definitely seeit pilling it's definitely like a superbrush like cotton material it's not asoft as like their poise leggings whichwere like super super soft and it's alittle thicker and stuff definitelyseems like a bit stiffer people arelittle like seams and panel detailinggoing around the leggings so I'm gonnatry these on after I talk about thesports bras I got the legacy fitnesssports bra and the bralette because Ikind of wanted to see the differencethey're both 35 dollars and the sportsbra says that daylight support I gotthis in a size small even though theysaid the size up I also got the bralettein a size medium so we can kind of likesee sizing they both have adjustablestraps the sports bra hasa single row of adjustable straps in thebralette has like a double adjustablestraps so the bralette definitely seemslike it'll have more support this onedoes say medium support and this onesays light support they both seem tohave some padding inside it feels kindof like thin padding which is honestlyfine with me made of the same materialas the leggings this one I'm kind oflike questioning why they had the logokind of like cut off I do think it'scute to have the bigger logo on thesports bra but it kind of just like cutsoff and you can't see the bottom of itso like I don't really know what thepoint of that was and it's kind of likea regular like v-neck in the front andlike classic like tanks out back and thebralette is a little more coverage alittle more high neck it looks like andit has some more panel detailing in thefront but the back is very similar andyeah these do you like collect a lot ofLin I already see them getting like hairand like fur on that like I put them onthe ground in my room for like half asecond Oh Jim shark you let me down yetagain I'm so disappointed guys theseleggings I really thought they weregonna be good and there's just a lot ofissues that I have okay so first of allJim shark why are we making these thickwintry fabrics in the summerI'm trying these on it's like 80 degreesin IPOP so yeahnot loving this is a very very thickfabric issue number two the sizing okayif you watch my channel a lot you willknow I'm basically always small and Jimshark there's like literally very veryfew exceptions and these leggings Istruggled so much to get on the legs areso tight there's absolutely no gift tothem I can barely even pick them off mylegs they just like release this fabrichas very minimal stretch I really don'tenjoy the fabric at all I definitelythink size up if not size up two timesjust because I'm like kind of likepretty uncomfortable in these justbecause they were so hard to get on somepositives are there's no camel toe goingon in these leggings they're also verycompressive so if you like really thickcompressive leggings these could be foryou I also don't think you'd have anycellulite problems with these becausethe fabric is so thick andbut some negatives of all that is it'stotally a but squisher I feel like I'mwearing a diaper right now because it'slike so it's making my butt like so unitbut also what is with this new trend theJim Turk is doing where they putting aseam below the but kind of like shortslike it's not flattering it's notlifting my butt it feels like it's likebringing my butt down and if you have abigger butt the seam will probably belike in the middle of your butt which isnot cute you don't want to cut off theline of your button anyway I think theconcept of these leggings is great likeI love that they're bringing back theirold logo these leggings probably wouldbe nice in the winter because they aredefinitely thick and plush the waistbandis also pretty good like I'm not gettinga lot of like cutting into the waistregion it kind of has a top seen butit's not a thick elastic so it's notkind of in a lot but I think Jim sharkcould have made this collection and kindof like a more lightweight stretchymaterial because this just doesn't feellike it was meant to be an athleticmaterial it's super restricting andcompressive and it's just like not myideal gym legging material[Music]now for the sports braI didn't address the straps much becauseI just like really didn't feel like itbut actually like this is a small of asports bra and I'm usually a small jobtruck sports grassI honestly think you can go with yournormal size on the sports grass it'sdefinitely compressing me but I actuallylook for compression in the sports brabecause I just feel like that helps ussupport definitely not a lot of supportin this because of the thin straps sothey were right to say it was a lightsupport I'm still kind of unsure of thislogo especially if you have boobs toothey kind of like cover up the bottom ofthe shark a little bit so if you foodslike don't get this light support one Ithink the back is pretty cute and basicno issues with it I do like how thestraps are adjustableI think this fabric would definitelyshow sweat because it's so like cottonII it's basically like wearing a plushcotton t-shirt it's just gonna show somesweat okay here is the bralette styletop I honestly like it like so much moreit's actually pretty supportive I woulddefinitely say mediums maybe even highsupport you're not showing a lot ofcleavage I do like the logo how you cansee more of it here it also goes likekind of well with the logo on theleggings it's like right on top of eachother I think the panel detailing on thetop is much cuter than on the littlesports bra it's pretty supportive I'mpretty impressed this is the medium andactually I would recommend getting asize up and this I don't know what thedeal with the sports bra was but Idefinitely love the medium and this Iwouldn't have gone any smaller becausethe fabric is so thick and compressive Iprobably wouldn't have been able to getit on those any smaller I'm definitely alittle disappointed in the leggings andthe overall composition and material Ithink they could have done a lot betterof a job because I definitely think it'sreally cool to bring back this logo Ijust really do not like the leggings atall but the sports bras are honestlypretty cute you could pair one of theseI think maybe the sweatshirts that mightbe cute[Music]next I have the legacy fitness shortswhich were $35 Elise in this color onthe website they're actually sold outalready which Jim ship hasn't sold outof an item in a hot minute because theirrecent releases have frankly not likebeen the cutest so basically they'rejust kind of like a classic little sweatshort I think these are really cutethey definitely remind me of like theshorts I wear on the house all the timeokay what I'm wearing now they have theold-school Jim shark logo and a littlepocket on the back it's definitely likea thick sweatshirt kind of materialsuper soft on the inside like when youget a brand new sweatshirt and it's justlike super fuzzy the only thing I'm alittle bit concerned about is that thewaistband is just a straight up likepiece of elastic which like usuallyisn't the most comfortable or flatteringthis could prove me wrong I don't knowbut let's see okay and here are theshorts they're definitely like superpoofy I think that they're only a littletoo poofy for my likingthey're definitely very like angry andlightweight I feel like I can reallylike just be myself in these but I alsofeel like I'm a child wearing a diaperso I'm a little mixed definitely true tosize for these an elastic waistband isthat like you can't really tighten itand it does this thing where it kind oflike bubbles if it's a little big sodefinitely I'm not a huge fan of theelastic I was a little worried thatyou'd have risk of flashing in thesethat I do feel like they're actuallypretty secure and like I'm not gonnaflash anyoneI really like the gym shirt pocketdoodad it also has little front pocketsI think this comes down to personalpreference I personally don't like myshorts to be like this balloony but I dothink they're very soft and very comfyand then I had to get the legacy Fitnesssweatshirtthis is $40 in this I think is probablymy favorite item of the collection firstof all it's this really cute yellowcolor which I'm not frankly sure I evenlook good in yellow but it's trendy andit's cute so I got it it has a littlelike pinstripe white thing on the sideand then the classic logo in the middleand it feels actually like a pretty likehigh quality like vinyl stick on itdoesn't like feel like it's gonna comeoff I got this in a medium and it doessay it's already an oversized fit onlineI don't know if this is gonna be like adouble oversize fit and maybe I shouldhave got this small I don't know okaythis is definitely my favorite thingI've gotten so far I think I am totallyfine with the medium it's definitely aboxy oversized fit but I don't thinkit's like too boxy and oversized I likejust really feel like a dumptruckathlete in this sweatshirt it just feelsreally cool really fun it's super softit's a very nice cropped length itcovers the broth but it's definitelystill cropped and I also like how theydidn't leave like an open end sometimespeople with cropped sweatshirts theyjust kind of like do like an open cuthem I definitely prefer if there's likea real hem it's definitely a little longon my hands so definitely good for ifyou got like long noodley armsdefinitely moves around a little bitwhen I do that but like as anysweatshirt would I think this is reallycute I'm not really sure how I love itfor summer I think the yellow is reallyfun I think it'd be nice if like a pairof little like a jogger sweatpants orsomething[Music]and then I got the laser cut collectionwhich was definitely not hyped at allthe laser cut tights are $55these are definitely advertises like aperformance leggings I'm definitelygonna keep that in mind when trying themonline and make sure that it's true itdefinitely does feel like a slickperformance material not gonna get anypilling or any kind of like Lynch onthis they do also feel very thin you cansee the fabric is like very thin andflimsy so I'll be interested to see ifthere's squat proof these look likethey're gonna be high rise but theydon't have a very thick waistband whichsometimes is flattering because then youget more room like around your butt andthe waistband is like off but okayhonestly this is how you make a summerfabric it's super thin super lightweightand definitely feels airy and I don'tfeel like I'm really hot in this and itdefinitely wasn't a struggle to get onit has a lot of stretch to itit's definitely hard to pull up becausethese little laser-cut details are verydelicate and I thought my nails weregoing through them the back has like alittle like pointy detailing and thewaistband goes above your butt so it'snot gonna cut off in the middle of yourbutt which is more flattering you don'thave that weird seam at the bottom ofthe butt which I don't know what I'vebeen doing I'm not getting any camel toeeven though these are very spin againsaying these are very thin you'reprobably gonna get a little bit ofcellulite but also because they're sothin I feel like they're not pushing mybooty down in any ways so I'm actuallykind of liking the leggings I feel likethey're really thin and lightweight ifyou like a slick kind of performancematerial that's super lightweight Ithink these leggings are really cute andI like that they come in this neutralcolor even though I feel like I kind oflook naked right now they just have onelittle logo around the hip here theyalso have one of these little likelaser-cut pockets which I don't lovethis kind of pocket because theyliterally just like cut the fabric andthen lined it with like this stuff so Idon't think it's like the best qualitythey remind me a lot of the duo leggingsexcept in the Select material but stilla lot of that same like thin stretchybags the leggings also feel like theyhave like a little thickness insertedinto the waistband like kind of like anelastic but not as restricting itactually feels like therea little bit extra compression which iskind of nice and then I got the lasercuts Sports brow which is $40 it haslike this interesting rap design I thinkit's cute on this side this guy kind oflike looks like it like cuts off and I'mnot really sure about that they alsohave double adjustable straps in theback and actually the support and thislooks pretty good because it does have abra hook closure with three clasps sousually I see this mostly on bras thatcome in like actual bra cup sizes andeverything but this one was just smallmedium largeI believe it got a small because it's mynormal size but it's actually like Ifeel like this might be a more of a highsupport so I guess let's see here's thesports bra I thought it would like itmore I just feel like this isn't veryflattering it's like okay we got alittle rap herethat's cute we probably should've justdone the rap on both sides because Idon't know what this little situation isI just feel like it kind of like cutsoff your boobsI took okay I'm wearing a banjo and thenI have this like bold fabric over thetop not my favorite it's actually prettyI'd say medium to high support and I dolike that it has a rough closure it hasfour adjustable straps I definitelyappreciate the gym truck is making moreoptions for larger chested girls it'sdefinitely a double thickness fabric andI'm getting a lot of compression youcan't really see the outline of the padsso that's good with me I just like don'treally think that this is that cute Iwish they may have like a different kindof option for the top that wasn't likethis because the ladies are actuallypretty decent like I don't hate theleggings so yeah that's in the laser-cutcollectionthat's really it for me for this videoI'm a little disappointed with thelegacy collections because I reallyliked the old-school Jim Kirk logo but Ithink the sweatshirt is definitelyreally cute and if you get like theirtrack suit like joggers that I didn'treview I think those would also bereally cute but definitely like anoversized look the material and theleggings was just like really way toowintry and compressive and made my buttfeel really flat so I just didn't likeitand I like the laser-cut except for thetop isn't very cute so I did feel likethe leggings are very lightweight andthey definitely feel super stretchy andlike the kind of legging I would want towear during the summer so yeah I hopeyou guys enjoyed this video make sure tosubscribe also doing a

"having that transaction go through itwas like such an amazing feeling butthere's never a point I was thinking ohgod we might lose 15 grand here 15 grandto me was a chance to find out what ifagain for me to drive a van was reallyreally cool like so after half an hour Ihad to turn the website off becausethere was just there was just too manysales going through what we completelysold out yeah that year was that yearwas incredibly incredibly tough I wish Icould say it was some sort of geniusmove right where we thought we workedout what this business plan is it wasnothing like that within 30 minutes wedid 30 thousand pound in sales but atthis point this is awfully scrappy ohyeah I can't describe manically was itthat was everything so in today's videowe're gonna try something new and we'regonna be recording some sort oflong-form content which I'm reallyexcited to do this actually came fromthis man's idea of our internal podcastyeah we've got because we've got so manyoffices now around the world we've gotlike you back in the day when we did acompany update we'd all get together inthe cinema and one of us may Bend SteveRena Paul whoever we would stand andaddress the whole nation of Jim sharkwhich is like 150 200 people and tellthem what was happening now in thecompany and what our plans are next timewhatever but pretty soon we're gonnahave the Denver office open we now got400 employees just here rightMauritius Hong Kong so we needed abetter way to communicate at scalebasically so we're in a podcast worldnow right - yeah we recorded our firstinternal podcast last week and it wastalking about sort of the initial stagesof Jim shark so that everyone worldwidetruly understands it and the feedbackhas been so positive that we thought youknow why not let's see how it goes on myyoutube channel put it out there we'llhave the conversation publicly andhopefully this is submit that you knowgoes well and if you do like it pleasedon't forget to comment subscribe allthat stuff let us know that you enjoy itso that we can obviously record more soyeah when so well internally we thoughtwe would give it a gopublicly on my youtube channel so yeahhere we go let's do it corner talk aboutthe starter Jim shot let's discuss thething that so there's the story that Bentold me the fat the first day I met Benthe story that I heardthat really impressed me was the firstever event body part and like I thinkexpose more so back in the day was so soso important to the fitness industry Ithink they've been you know quite sadlyI suppose becoming kind of less relevantbut that being said for us they weresuper relevant right yeah like I mean ifyou go back to that first body powderwill not go back even further right thefirst body power that I went to wasprior to gym shot so gym shot obviouslydidn't exist at that point in to me itwas it was a place that me and my mateswent to after school or whatever afterwork just cuz it was like that coolplace where all those or big Americanbodybuilders were coming together inBirmingham which was just likecompletely just it was just somethingthat just didn't happen right weird aswell that's Birmingham whether ithappens to be round the corner that'sstrange you've got the royalty of thefitness industry in her hometown I thinkwell looking back right at the time hedidn't he didn't fill out this butlooking back I talked about sort of thestars align into get Jim shot to whereit is but you say the fact that bodypower the biggest event in the UK and atthe time albeit wasn't the biggest inEurope I think it was the best in termsof like sort of the quality of event ofthe event from the people attending thethe athletes of also the companies yeahit was it was certainly up there in theworld so yeah the fact that thathappened 20 minutes away from where Iwas born and grew up it's just you thinkthat's one of the stars aligned to makeall this happen yeah definitely so yeahthat first body power wasn't it butbefore even that like I said we went askids we went just because it was thecool place to go and and that was thefirst place for me that I ever reallywanted to be involved in fitness and itwas at that place where I thoughtregardless of how it is whether it'ssupplements whether it's clothingwhether it's through you know fitnessand compete in whatever it was I justwanted to be involved in fitness ingeneral so now you say when you say thatyou say you and your mates went thereand you walked around and you know youheroes they're not stuff paint thepicture for me of you and your mates atthat time how old are you what are youdoingis it college is it part-time jobs withthat point I guess 17 years oldtypical 17 year old lad I think it wasit was a sick form 17 years old it sickfor massiveinto the gym you're honest at that pointthe gym was literally everything in ourlives so like I said to have to be ableto be at the epicenter of fitness for italbeit just for one weekend was supercool so yeah we just we were typical Iloved the gym in the summer we would diein the in the winter we were just ballcompany a load of food following you saytypical I think that's typical now but Ithink back then cuz you know similarages I think back then being 17 and thatobsessed with the gym where you knowabout sort of cutting and bulking anddoing all that kind of stuff I think youwere definitely at the the what wouldyou call that sort of the early adoptersof that I think there's low descendingyou was doing that now back then when Ithink of me and my group of friends allwe knew was drinking protein shake go tothe gym dude I mean but I think becauseyou had got into Z's and Greg Plitt andall these guys super early you'd hadthat like three dmj American influenceon your sort of training regimes yeah itwas Australia Greg Plitt Scott HermanScooby all those sort of guys like yesmaybe it was weird but I remember for meit was it was genuine ago as a board ofwar craft all fitness videos learninghow to you know do a proper bench pressor a squat or whatever it was so yeahthat was a interest in time but I thinkbecause all of my mates did it and I'mtalking like there was a group of atleast 10 to 15 of us that wouldliterally have like arms Friday chessMonday I think maybe for me it did justfeel like a completely normal thing soyou go so you go to body power that'slike the mecca of everything that youcare about at that time yeah and whatyou got to remember is I think when youlook at the industry now and things likestring divest sand and a lot of thestuff that lifters wear nowadays are soreadily available they weren't isreadily available back then and I thinklet alone in Birmingham or in the UK inparticular so the first time I ever sawa string of s that wasn't in ablack-and-white picture on ArnoldSchwarzenegger or one of the big lifterswas it body power and I remember walkingaround sort of picking one up and Ithink it was a MPC stringer or a goldshimmer string of similar at the timeand just seeing that in real life waswas nuts and don't get me wrong we triedit on and it just completely drowned usit was like way too big but having thatAmerican at the timeinfluenced rock up in Birmingham for aweekend was crazy so you were going thenas just avisitor walking around during the wholeget some free supplements get a stringget all that jazz what was the pointwhere you went I want to do I want to dosomething here so I'm so yeah that's agood I just sort of thought of anotherquestion for myself there did you haveJim shark at this point no so at thetime so I vividly remember having to andI was so miffed at the time having toleave all my mates at body power earlyexcept to go and do my shift at PizzaHutso when you're delivering PK so at thetime there was no Jim shark it was justschool in the day or whatever pizza inthe evening usually like five till 10:00obviously body powers was a day thing soI was literally there as a fan and likegenuinely just obsessed with the wholefitness industry mm-hmm so Jim shotstarts start drop shipping supplementsI'm guessing this is in between bodypower events yeah so it was body powerthat wanted me to be or wanted us as agroup to be involved in Fitness right sowent away at that point and found outabout Shopify made this website and thewebsite because it was a case of itwasn't there wasn't like a pall in termsof any specific direction it was just itwas always like the the image in my headwas involvement in the fitness industryand however that looks obviously got thewebsite up and just dropship supplementso filled up the website was all withall the supplements I could possiblyfind they would be shipped from anothervendor someone would order it and itwould then obviously ship by the vendorthrough Jim shark we make a small marginand I remember it took two must havetook about two months to get the firstsale the first sale was for somethingcalled us sin hyperbolic mass which islike a South African brand it was like awhite guy now and it was 50 quid andthink we made two pounds profit on thatand just having that transaction albeitit was nothing right to quit at the timehaving that transaction go through waslike such an amazing feeling it was likenothing I'd ever experienced beforeHarley from Shopify talks about that alot right at the motor so that firstsale he says like there's a superimpressive metric which he gave abouthow many Shopify vendors or you know newentrepreneurs get that feeling per daynow thanks to shop before I have thatfirst sale it's really cool that isn'tit so it's cool you remember that somuch but the so so it's body pilot madeyou want to get involved in the fitnessindustry so you've done that the dropshipping thingwhen was the first point you went tobody power having the gym shot websitelive selling stuff so first party powerI think was a visitor and I think Ithink it was the second buddy power thatever went to at this point Jim shot waslive right so at this point you dropshipping supplements we weren't making awhole lot of revenue we had a Facebookpage it wasn't really doing a fat lotand I remember being at that show andagain it was just it was more of a goodinstinct of just a feeling of we have tobe here next year so at the show we waswandering around I remember thinkingjust we have to be here so I went up tothe place where he book stands they hadlike a little booth by the sort ofentrance slash exit and at the time itwas a guy called Ali Upton that I spoketo and I didn't know who he was at thetime you know still a mate to this dayand he he basically owns the Chicot andthe show and I just said to him like canwe ever stand what what whatever standwe can get whatever the Chiba stuntmenused to look like some little ragam isthis point Tony right roughy hole in ourshoot holes in our shoes or somethingjust literally just all tracks herewhatever and just said just whatever thecheapest and is I think the cheapest andat the time was about three grandthrough building up Jim shark andpersonal savings and all that we'dliterally been out to save 3,000 poundswhich was everything you had everythingwe had literally everything I remembersaying to him right we'll do thisbecause I knew that we had 12 months topay for it because we was obviously atthe show the year before I just saidright that's it we'll do it sign up forit there and then and at the time wesigned up for the smallest and now inthe next 12 months we absolutely graphedit at this point bought the screenprinter bought the sewing machine andand handmade the clothes for thefollowing 12 months and at that pointbecause if we were hand making theclothes the margin was was so muchbetter right and we were literally itwas literally a case of what do we wantto wear what what what do we enjoy whatdo we like and let's just make it so itwas all around hoodies stringersobviously because they just weren'tavailable at the time more fittedt-shirts there was some shorts calledlike the look shorts that sort of stuffand we just spent twelve inches handmaking product which was which was nutsI mean I remember actually on the shortswhich was really really lucky actuallythere was a the shorts were actuallypurchased abroadpurchased in Pakistan and it was a guycalled Tanviwho got friendly without speech andquite a lot and I just said to him likeyou know got these shorts we can'tafford to pay you for the shorts but canyou sort of do me a favor and ship as aload because that would really help hersort of build up revenue so that wecould pay for the pay for the floorspace at the expo the following year andhe did us the favor to be fair to mesentence the shorts completely free butI just didn't think would happen so thatwas a huge again and so much of thestars aligned him right if all thesethings didn't happen if all these sortof pieces didn't fall into place then wewouldn't be where we are today I don'tthink so yeah sent them over we soldthem and it to be fair we'd made therevenue back on the shorts for the costof what it cost us within a week or soso sent him the money he was obviouslyhappy at that point and then with thatmoney we could then pay for the standardI remember actually calling the guys atbody power and saying you know we'redoing quite well at the moment can weupgrade the size of the stand so wemanaged to do that and yeah that yearwas that year was incredibly incrediblytough I was I was at university at thetime so I do University in the day I doPeter between 5:00 p.m. and I think thefinish if closed at 10:00 but usuallyyou'd end up staying a little bit afterjust to clean up and then sort of do Jimshark on the evening but that was atough year but it certainly didn't feellike at that at the time because it wassort of like my passion it didn't itsound worse than it was it was Iwouldn't have had it any other way youknow so well fast falling then up to youmaking clothes now the years past whoactually you're gonna be exhibiting abody power now the reason I think thistopic is such a great one in this storyso good is because well I think kind ofhappened here is these days you maybunch of other people we get invited tothese events and we get asked to talkabout our pioneering retail strategyright or our pioneering influencermarketing strategy and they say that wewould have one of the earliest brandsever do an influencer marketing like alot of stuff but the reason this thisthis seems like to me like this littlead-hoc thing which I want you and yourbunch of friends did together just youknow as like a passion project whichsort of burst and now you know notoriousretail strategy and influencer marketingsort of as a whole - I mean because thiswas the first time you'd ever seebespoke and all met any the gym trackathletes right yeah so it was thatat this point so going back to what Isaid earlier we had like a heroes are onYouTube right our heroes weren'tanywhere else and you're growing up itwas all around sort of football being avilla fan around from around here thosethose were our heroes but as we got intosort of teenage years those heroesshifted onto YouTube and it's nowlooking back I feel like maybe thatwasn't the norm everywhere but with usit certainly was so heroes Matt oh goshChris levar doe Jeff side along goodbyeLex Griffin in Manchester those were thepeople that we were watching on YouTubeand following on Facebook at the time soit was literally a case of we're superproud of this product that we're makingand we think it's great so we thoughtthat's getting touch to them and see ifthey'd like it and you know got in touchwith Lex he was only in Manchester sosent some stuff up to him and then hestarted giving feedback we were doingSkype calls with Matt and Chris reallyregularly and just chatting to them andwe saw I guess we just sort of becamefriends via the internet and they werefeeding about the product they wereloving it was things they didn't likeand at this point they are going throughit but this does zero commercial missgoing on right this is literally justsome guys on YouTube who teach me by howto train and then some kids in Englandare making some stringers and stuff andyou just talking to them about theproduct you're not paying them there'sno typical influence of stuff going onyet know this this goes back to what Isaid before it's a case of we justwanted to be involved and to be able tospeak to our heroes get feedback to ourheroes and have our heroes wearing theproduct was like for me that was likeyou know that was the aim right thatfelt amazing so it was during thisperiod we sort of built up therelationship with them and to be fair itwasn't until I reckon a few weeks beforemost a month or two before the bodypower that we got in touch him he saidyou know obviously blex was easy as itwas a short drive down from Manchesterbut all the other guys you know we hadthe money to fly them in so it was likedo you want to fly and we'll cover allthe costs obviously do you want to cometo a body power in the UK and don'tthink any of them had been to the UKbefore so for them it was a hugeadventure free trip doing so yeah theyall flew in went down and picked them upin the car they were sort of like rammedinto the back of my car at the timedrove them up to the event we stayed inlike a budget hotel in Birmingham at thetime and yeah we just we did the eventand and like you say there was noplanned I wish I could say it was somesort of genius move right where we'dsort of youworked out what this business plan is itwas nothing like that it was literally acase of following a gut instinct anddoing what we thought was calling themright at the time so like when you seethere's a point on stress there likewhen anybody who watched our athleteswho's watched our athletes vlog beforewould see them flying to our events inyou know on nice aeroplane standingreading those hotels everything's verywell planned the hand structure and theygot our fleet managers and all that kindof stuff but at this point this isproperly scrappy oh yeah crap flightsstuffing me back I'm on my dad's car toget them offwould you Hotel all that kind of stuffyeah and then even I mean and even thenright like you say like now it's greatbecause athletes get managed and so andit was literally a case of you knowwe'll see you at the event because whatyou've got remembers so at the time mybrother and my dad helped out so theystayed back the was a with the time wehad like an old unit in in Droitwich andthey stayed back there and they sort oflooked after any orders that was goingout and just made sure everything wasgood there so we literally had to doeverything so I borrowed my granddad'svan and loaded that up with all thestock taken it to the event anyone hasever been to the NEC and tried to workout how that place works that's like alabyrinth it's it's an absolutenightmare and one minute you wereallowed in there and you're not and Iremember sort of almost just drivingthrough the entryway and sort of landingit by their loading bays opening up thevan piling out the boxes and thenrushing them into the stand yeah it wasproper proper scrapping it was reallyhard work we we had to almost look afterthe guys and obviously we they wereheroes so we wanted to spend time withhim and get to know them but then we hadto help sort of help with the stand sowe didn't actually physically build thestand that was outsourced but gettingthings like we you know we'd forgot toeven get hangers like we hadn'tsupported approach before that on top ofthat just going back as well it was thatinitial event that essentially moved meinto my decision of the week before Iboth left University and I left pizzaher as a job so that was my I'm all innow sort of thing so I was literallydedicating every single second I had toto Jamaa still forgot the hangers yeahit was it was absolutely not so we hadto bring it all together and to be fairwe we on the actual opening day whichwas Friday Fridaysanyone who's been to an event will knowthat the first days of trade oh but itnever really is an insulation that iswhere you have the main sort of guestsso we were told Friday's a trade day andI think it opened at 9:00 I think it was9:00 or 10:00 so we thought we had a bitof time we probably had about half anhour to an hour more work to doobviously all the athletes were downthere and it was just you know there wasa couple of us I think down in Craigcame down and helped as well so think itwas four of us in total and we werestill sort of finished off the stand Iwas carrying a box over and they sawannounced that the show was openingwhich to us wasn't a big deal because wedidn't really think that many peoplewould know who you are this is the Sunyou know we were just we had a smallFacebook page Instagram wasn't a thingat the time you know I think pretty sureMatt Ogas at the time was the biggestathlete and he would have been in around20,000 YouTube subs which by today'sstandards is obviously not a lot but thetime he was and I think he still isright like the boy a particularlynatural bodybuilding the doors openedand I was carrying the box obviouslytowards the stand and then the entry iswas behind our stand and what I can onlydescribe as a load of people likeliterally it was like a flood of peoplejust piled on to the gym shot standingI'm sort of carrying boxes and there wasliterally hundreds of people surroundingthe stand and I'm having to sort ofexcuse me to try and get them out theway to get this stock to the stand andthis is on the trade day not and this ison trade day I I have never knownanything like and to be fair it wassuper cool because a lot of the peopleyou know a lot of the people were therebecause we launched the looks tracksuitat this events I think a lot of peoplewanted to see that a lot of people justwanted to come and have a chat which wassuper cool and I remember just speakingto people and we you know they weresaying are where you lived in tonightand we went down to two Iron Works afterso it was a super cool experience but itwas it was a it was in that and albeitat the time you have very little time tothink because it is just I can'tdescribe how manic it was it was justten hours of constant just work makingsure everyone's okayrestocking the shelves going back tothis we sort of had stock inboxes roomaround the back it was just completelyand utterly non-stop and I think lookingback I'd say that was one of the mostincredible and pivotal times in Jimshark history and to be honest it wasone of themsurprising because you just do notexpect anything like at the time we weregetting a handful of sales a day on thewebsite like I said a few thousandfollowers on Facebook it was nothinghuge but it was at that moment we went Isort of I've genuinely felt like we wereat the epicenter of the fitness industryand to feel like that in your sort ofhometown is absolutely crazy so I knowwhy I think that happened but I'minterested to hear why you think thathappened and I want a sort of I want toalso spell out to those who don't knowthe fitness industry that at this pointnobody else has done the influencerthing at an event have they really yetyou had a load of sort of you got yougot the IFBB due to the competitionwinners who would want some great youknow accolades on stage for theirphysique and stuff but they weren'treally on YouTube or Facebook orwhatever else right so you're taking aroomful of sort of what would call itsort of traditional achievers in thatworld you're sticking some youtubers inthere who were competing on some likethey wouldn't mind me saying it's lowerlevel shows right yeah there's astampede past all those guys to get toyour guys right well to be fair therewas this weird thing of at the time youwere either a competing bodybuilder oryou were like a social media sort ofperson and to be fair like no the theinitial group that came over Ilan JeffMacke Chris and Lex they were likemassive massive pioneers in what theydid they were the first people that sortof really did that whole Fitness socialmedia thing that this thing that rightnow is so big right I think even likefrom now from a from where I sit I lookat YouTube and online and you see some Isee three really distinct communitiesright so you see like makeup and beautygame in a fitness like when I lookonline those communities are you knowthe most sort of powerful communitiesand that's where you see people reallysort of come together the theseindividuals certainly started that and Ifelt like we we just sort of happened tobe there for the harness that I thinkthat was super cool so in your opinionthen we're all those people which needto get the gym shark or whatever sheneed to get to the to the mat Ogas andthe jeff side and whatever I'd saymainly those guys right but I do thinkit was a bit of both because I thinkwhat we offered was like a central placewhere like-minded people could cometogetheralbeitwas by no means plan that it was by nomeans a conscious effort I think that'swhat happened I think I constant Driveand I think it's to this to this dayright were just to create the thingswhether it's a product or an event ratethe things that we would want to wear door go to and I think we inadvertentlydid that and by doing that I thinklike-minded people similar to ourselvesall sort of resonate with that and cametogether and that was cool and I thinklike I said that the fact that we becameto the stand they you know they boughtstuff they spent on with the athlete andthe fact there was a massive group of usthe winter ironworks after was what'scalled it for me that's a wickedparallel because although people wouldnever know anywhere this comparison I'veheard so many founders or skateboardbrands have the same thing in streetwhere brands right where they were partof this sort of rebel undergroundcommunity where skateboarding in itsearly days was seen as like crazy kidsbeing pissed and whatever else in thestreet and they went out and started youknow Nike and the sports fans didn'treally represent what they were about sothey went away using screen printersstarted their own sort of street wearthings on guild auntie's or whateverelse and that's them because of paralleldo only 100 percent but but people wouldnever normally make the comparison Ithink between Fitness and Jim shark andwhat they have done but it's all just tome sub communities that would weren'trepresented by any brands yeah and thena brand came along that was the firstperson to stand up and go I representwhat you stand for which is what youguys did which is what I think theskateboard brands did which is reallycool but I know obviously on yourchannel there's loads of sort ofwould-be entrepreneurs or evensuccessful entrepreneurs already in theright right who are the startingsomething new or whatever else so I wantto give some I want to give some frameof reference financially at this pointso you've got three grand on the standright right then you upgraded it andthat cost you got me an extra two fivefive so five grand total and then yourstock which we'll talk he does it'squite a separate and then the gettingathletes over in the hotels and stufftotal cost probably a few grandI'd say it's gonna look him back all-insomewhere in 10 to 15 grand I would saywhich by the way was like buy a clearmile the most whatever had right sopizza at the time was paying I was like$4.99 five quid an hour so that sort ofmoney was just crazy right it was it waseverything you haveyeah completely went all in and but likeI said but I don't want to come acrosswas there was never this moment of wegoing all in it was a case of this feelsright this is what we want to do this iswhat we're passionate about to let youknow let's go for ityeah yeah it was assuring you stomachfeeling didn't thinking on an event thisthing called influencer marketing oroffline fitness events or whatever elseit was just what you guys thought wascalled on us and I think and I stillthink we do this day right it's lessabout the risk of what the image theparticular risk that we're taking sothere's never a point was thinking ohgod we might lose 15 grand here it's acase of 15 grand to me was a chance tofind out what if you're I mean like ifif this thing goes well if this is coolif this is an experience of our lifetimeand then it flops and never happensagain to me it was worth every penny andwe were fortunate enough for it to goincredibly wellso Friday's trade day what was it likeSaturday because if that was the propertime it opened exact same thing againyeah so Saturday was just as busy if notslightly more busy but it felt much moredifficult and the reason was obviouslyFriday night jump back in the van goback to the warehouse my dad and brotherhelped us out in terms of getting morestock in and taking that van back to theNEC and loading the stock up and sobasically had no sleep so Saturday itwould just go again albeit I think wewere slightly more mentally prepared forwhat was to comeit was just honestly it was rammed andat this point we just couldn't deal withthe amount of people that were coming tothe stand so be fair call it my matesOscar and Dan Blackwell who were fromCoventry who we historically went to theevent with called them up obviously theyknew the event I think to be fair theymight been come in anyway but they cameand helped us out so dropped everythingthey were doing that day and helped usout so thank God they came and did thatas well yeah so between like Dan andCraig skipping their exams Blackwell andash grant helping us out as well my dadand brother in the warehouse everyonereally really helped us and if it wasn'tfor those people helping us we wouldhave really really struggled so and aswell this is just two things therethere's the other people the otherbrands that are at the expo and I'mreally excited to hear what they'vethought of that then the other thing isyou only started coming out on youtubermaking yourself sort of known as who youare a Jim shark after like four yearsmaybe five years of Jim shark right acouple years backand so I think sort of the world hasonly known you as like successfulentrepreneur Ben Francis but again Ithink it's really important to stressthat point that nineteen-year-old key toour viewers I'm not right nineteen atBlinn nineteen your kid in the van quickbrush back I'll carry the stock in allthat it's all that stuff you wereproperly like you know stringer yourpants like rushing around like to allintents and purposes like parents orgirlfriends or whatnot might think youknow that's sort of typical what's hedoing don't get a real job kind of thingtoo I mean which is so funny when youthink about that now because like I saidthe rest of the world knows he's is sortof successful entrepreneur it wasn'tlike it was incredibly tough but it waswhat I love doing right it was again forme to drive a van was really really coollike when I was a kid like working mygranddaddy would let me drive the vanoccasion say and I love driving it sothe fact that I got to drive it into theNEC was just sick yeah you I meaneverything's like an adventure at thatpoint everything is like first so that'sthat's super cool and this feels like alesson in your people say it sounds likea cliche but just doing what you loveeverything you've said to me so far aswe've been recording it's just likedoing it because I loved it speaking ofthe athletes cuz I love them I mean likewearing the clothes because I love theclothes we're making cuz I want to makethem so although that's a bit of acliche I feel like you're the kind ofliving example of that will eventuallywork out right if you just do what youlove and you care about and so then goback to that first point as well I'mguessing you've got USN there and maybeoptimum nutrition and some of the reallybig brands of the fitness industry whohave drops best part of a hundred grandon just their stand build in their spaceright and then you've got these likefour Brummie kids with a bit of a poxystand in the corner and all the crowdsare rushing over to you yeah and so thething is because so much was going onduring the weekend we had no idea whatwas going on around us the fact that weknew the the event right could we'vebeen there prior so we knew that you SMwere the biggest and the best life theyjust were they own that event everysingle year they were they were there onthe entry I think you had like MaxieMarceau and sounds like that smart shakewas opposite us as well yeah I think ohand the sort of glam Bureau and brandswere there as well so it wasn't so wehad no idea what was going on right andwe genuinely we just I think you justsort of assume that everything's thesame and youevery stand is as busy as what we wereit was until until after the event andagain vividly remember doors closedeverything had gone and we would justlie on the floor and the stands I thinkit was someone from oh and actually cameover and they were just saying they'vejust said like awesome weekend Congratslike how did you do it and we were likehonestly not even sure ourselves not aclue and not even a clue in terms of howwe how we did this thing but how we evensort of survived it physically in termsof getting all the work done so yeahthat was again it was just absolutelynuts and it was it was such a specialthing to be a part of so there's anotherlittle nugget in this story which Ireally like which probably bring us tothe end but Sunday finish Monday go homesleep recover whatever else and thensomething else particularly specialalbum Monday night didn't it yeah so atthat point we saw broke down the standfinished Sunday so suddenly you get thebreakdown Monday obviously is the firstday after thing everyone sort of startedto head off home and then Monday night Iwas just literally sat on my own in theliving room it was must have been aboutmidnight just watching telly or whateverand over the weekend we turned all thestock off because again everything wassort of made to order at the time it wasprinted it was sewed and so on so it wasa case if we don't want too many ordersgoing out the looks tracksuit wouldobviously been announced at the eventand it had been sold at the event butthat had never gone online we had a fewleft so I put them on the website did apost on Facebook thought nothing of itand announced that the look tracks itwas live and so were stringers t-shirtshoodies and so on were also put on andwithin that half an hourlike I think because this is thispicture I think because this whole thingwith the look structure in particular inJimmy shark had gone viral and this hadgone viral globally by the way and wehad no idea that this would happen inthe first 30 minutes of turning thewebsite on we did more sales it was likethan in the entire history of Jimmyshark like from a financial perspectiveyeah in the first half an hour so afterhalf an hour had to turn the website offbecause there was just there was justtoo many sales going through what wecompletely sold out to put things intoperspective prior to the event we wereselling I would estimate between threeand five hundred-pound revenue a daywhich was you know that was great at thetime after the event within 30 minuteswe did 30empowered in sales which was like CSIagain mind boggling and I remember satthere and i was literally sat there in aliving room on my own that night justturned the website off and it was thecombination of the event of going to thegym with every one of the almost thatthe reaction of the sales and the socialmedia reaction afterwards and it wasthat night I remember thinking agenuinely can see that we were undersomething really special here and yeahthat was again a just an incrediblymemorable point in my life it feels likethe perfect place to end it then to behonest 500 500 pound 3 to 500 pounds aday in sales to 30 grand you know youwant something then do you",22,UCTLDHVizMEHSOt5A-rpN_Rw,Ben Francis,284,55,0,6185,"['Gymshark', 'how I started Gymshark', 'build a business', 'gary vaynerchuk', 'Whitney

what up guys Gero Campisi here it's gota new packaging from jin shark a coupleof other new shirts so i'm going to do alittle review for you guysthe reason I'm wearing this shirt isbecause the sizing is a little bitdifferent on these so I wanted to giveyou guys my take so this is what we havewe've got the new Jim shark tank topsthese are seamless tank tops so it'sjust like the t-shirt that I'm wearingexcept in a tank top form the reason I'mwearing this t-shirt is because thesizing is ended up being a little bitweird and so I wanted to make sure youget we're aware of it so when you'reordering them online you get the rightsize these are size mediums so I got theflu here and then that cool gray that isshow you this is the dark gray thisone's actually sold out already sohopefully you don't like it too muchthere is a different grade it's just asnice it's a little bit lighter and as ablack tip shark down is really cool tooat the end of the video I will show youthe element t-shirt very very coolt-shirt this is a medium as well so soin this shirt and they're seamless asthey're seeing this line I wear a mediumand so I picked up mediums in the tanktops as well but as it turns out they'rea little bit tight so if I was going toorderI definitely get a large and so let meshow you what they look like I'll popone of these on for you and I'll seemissing filming ok so let me just showyou guys the material first in case youdon't have one of their t-shirts it'sbasically like a stretchy fabric it'skind of a polyester blend I wouldimagine um it's cool because it's gotventing down the side so if you can seeit there and that parts a little bitdarker and it's also kind of ribbed andit's just stretchy everywhere and it'scool because there's literally no seamsat all on the shirt so if I turn itinside out thus there are seamless linesactually that's that's a lie the twoplaces where they actually it's onething of fabric but they actuallyattached it at the top here so that'sthe only area where their seams which isjust right up top on your trap there soreally cool design it's okay for them tobe tight since I don't have scenesyou're not going to have like rubbing anannoyance or anything this just ripsright off no big deal they also have thelittle gym shark underneath there whichis a nice little touch same thing withthis shirt here you flip it up they havea little gym shotgun Heath it's a littledetails guys you know it's a littledetails okay let me throw this on realquick and I'll show you what they looklikealright so this is what it looks like onin my opinion guys there are awesomeshirts don't get me wrong it's supersick very comfortable but the way theycut the shirt here underneath around alot area the chest you kind of have togo side up in my opinion like I said Iwork pretty much medium and all theirother t-shirts and seamless shirts andthe fitted shirts but in this one if Igot a pump in this at all at the gym Ifeel like I'd be like it's just it's alittle bit too much for the scene righthere right on the side then or soit looks awesome but I think I wouldprefer to probably go with a large inthese hmmbut did you show off the physique I meanyou're not hiding anything in this ifyou got a stomach you're gonna see itand this one you see that Chris oh sobut yeah they're really nice superbreathable with the breathable areasrunning up the sides and down the backof the shirt as well so again this wouldbe very for like you know running on ahot day in the gym obviously lifting allthat kind of stuff so let me show youthe blue one which is also another verycool color this one's still in stock soyou can pick this one up and also justto reiterate on my size about 180 rightnow I'm 5 foot 10 my chest is around 43on flex when I flare my laps out I'mprobably like 45 ish and then my waistis about 30 inches so I don't thinkyou're really gonna run into issues downhere but um even the light doesn't payon these but like I said it's just theway they cut these around up here itjust did I don't think you'd really wantto wear this super tight you know that'sjust my opinion so let me show you whatthe blue one looks like in kitchen sinkand then this is the blue this is areally cool blue it doesn't seamlessshirt that I had before one of myfavoritesit looks awesome like imma bring sunnyday and but once again if you havea big chest and if you have big thicklatsI mean my last argument apnic youprobably won't want to go a size up inthese in my opinion as you can see it'sit's very very tight fitting around thearound the side here I feel like thisshould probably cut it a little bit downjust to get as a light area but thisisn't going to cut it it still looksreally awesome but it's really not evenmuch room at all you knowoh yeah so that's what it look likefreakin trap action up there oh yeahreally cool they smell kind of good toostretchy it probably won't shrink it allsince the material they're made of soit's going to fit however you get themforever out of magic so better those arethe jib shark seamless tanks you can getthem now this one I'm pretty sure it'ssold out this one's still available plusthere's other cool colors as a coolyellow there's a cool light gray andthere's a like ah what is it a peachkind of color which actually lookspretty cool and then I'll show you guystheir element t-shirt which they havebeen advertising a bunch on Instagramand stuff I'll show you what that lookslike real quick okay so this is theirelement in black these t-shirts arereally cool because they're stretchy sothis is a medium and it fits me perfectthey make you look about twice as big asyou actually are it's like just don'tweigh that they're cut makes your trapslook huge makes you look like a badassand then you can see the back very coolthey have the chin shark up here the gymshark down there and it's nice becauseI'm the opposite side of the of the fitsweat pushing out the gym shark out herebut to just cover it in gym short whenyou bar this together but still not toomuch in my opinion like I would wearthese together to work out so there yougo there's the seamless tank tops theirelement t-shirts these are still instock I think in select I think theyhave four different colors at leastthey're really fricking sweet I'mprobably bigger than them and I hope youenjoyed I hope it was helpful if youhave questions

hey what's up guys welcome back to thechannel so i was actually planning onreleasing a chess video that i didyesterday with my friend nick of the gymhot core chest workout you guys aregonna absolutely love it incorporates mydrop set techniquei mean i'm actually still really sorei'm having a hard time bringing my armstogetherbut something happened yesterday that iwanted to talk to you guys about and ithink you should know aboutand moving forward my goal with mychannelis to have a nice balance of currentevent videosand educational content but like i saidthis happened yesterdayand i want to fill you guys in becausegymshark hasrecently made a post on their instagrampage and then deleted it because of allthe backlash that they gotand they're in a serious hot seat rightnow and the postin particular is this one right here andit was screen shotted bythin blue line media so thank you tothem for getting the screenshotand i actually saw this post and irememberseeing the post because after i did myvideoon their whole body positivity thingthat they've been doing and other peopleposting videosi felt like this post was a response toall of thatright and so they said imagine a brandsupporting body positivity and blacklives matterbothering you well stay bothered becausewe're notgoing to stop and so this obviouslybeing a verypolarizing political post spacked a lotof debate in their comment sectionand then things just spiraled out ofcontrol to the pointwhere jim shock had to immediatelydelete the post because they weregetting so much hateand the reason why they were getting thehate is becausepeople obviously commenting it's apolitical post there's both sides tothis equation rightso you have some comments like this fromsheawhat about blue lives and then jim shaqrespondsyes cannot wait for avatar 2with a blue hat obviously saying thatthey care more aboutfictional avatar characters than thepolice officers rightand then there's this one by rosie twocrying faces my favorite brandhashtag blue lives matter again gymshockavatar 2 is certainly going to be a goodone with a blue hotand then down here from mock looks likejim shocklost every single police officer thatliftsjim shock responds will be okayso and there were hundreds of responseslike this fromjim shack and people from the blue livescommunity we're seeing theseand feeling very dismissed and jim shackmade it very clear that theydo not care or at least that's what itlooks likefrom their response remember it's themresponding to these commentsand so this went viral and gained a lotof tractionand then instagram pages like this onethin blue line mediasaw it and reposted it to bringawareness to itand then all those people i mean thinblue line media has over 150000 followers on instagram i'm sorry 116000 followersand many other pages reposted it theyall went to jim shack started leavingcommentsspiraled out of control jim shaq deletedit and then they issuedan apology and what's getting peopleevenmore upset is they feel like the apologywas kind of like a a backhanded apologywhere they were kind of apologizing butnot reallyand then they actually just copied andpasted this all over instagram and ifyou guys go on here and you see all thecomments and all the responsesand all these different pages it'sliterally control v control v control vcontrol v on every single posttalking about what they said and so i'mgoing to read their apology and let youguys decide for yourselvesif you think that it was sincere orbackhanded so jim shock saysand this is off of the thin blue livesmedia postjim shock says it is never our intentionto causeany offense with our comments we're 100committed to standing up against racismand amplifying blackvoices we are at the beginning of achallenging journey and have a lot tolearnwe do support police officers emergencyworkers and the great work that they dowe wholeheartedly apologize for some ofour commentsand we completely understand that notevery member of the police force has thesame negative attitude and prejudicestowards members of the black communitywe apologize for generalizing all policeofficers with our commentsas that was not our intention weunderstand that some of our commentscame acrossdismissive it may have caused upset forthose that do stand with us againstracismfor that we apologize we are revisingour response process to avoid commentslike these being posted in the futureand to ensure that our comments sectionremains a positiveplace again we apologize for any upsetcaused regards the gym shock teamand if you go to the comments on theirapologya lot of people feel that it was justwords like there was actually no meaningbehind itand you got responses like this lisaveronedon't bother the damage is done and weunderstand how you reallyfeel clee bear you can kick rocks andpound sand with your overpricedworkout clothes war fighter athleticyou understand that police officers comefrom all races ethnicity ethnicitiesand walks of life you pick they sidethat you think gets you the mostsales you're a brand built on vanitynot ethics or morals and you've reallyshown it and it goes on and on and onand if you go to their most recent postthat came after the one they deletedit's a post where it shows some guyboxingand they're poking fun at trying topre-order the ps5 but your credit cardsays declinedand if

it always feels like ahigher rise yeah it is it really comesup really high I feel like I got a runnow do a lot le t SG ho let's gotrue le G yet not really wrongbellybutton jackI don't usually run unless I'm beingchased or likes I see other peoplerunning up my goai there's something weall major we're running away fromsomething bad but the pants smell goodyeah what about support for the bra doyou like are there any sports bras thatdon't hurt when you're having no onehiker I'm a hikerand I I stay at a wouldn't live milesper hour that's a good pointer I thinkwe each do different types of workoutsthis one does some hardcore working outor do you Orangetheory and it's just youspend a lot of time on the treadmill Ialways start on the treadmill I my pantsfall down pants on the ground lookinglike a fool with your pants on theground wait err what kind of workoutsdid you um as few as possible but when Ido work out I have a peloton bike uhmostly because I don't like to leave myhouse and you know I like kind of beingin one position and I know cuz I'musually like kind of bit over it's notI'm usually bent over and I feel like Idon't do a lot of up and down likemoving to stretch it has you stay forone position for me yeah but I thinkthese work amazingly as spent in oh Iwant them they're really cute right nowso I know I said that they felt likethey were staying in place but I keepfinding myself going like this so it iskind of falling I think it's also justpreference I like it to beI think everyone every woman alive and Iam going on a limb speaking for all ofus we like a peds to stay up we donothing is that crazy we doconcerned with armpits why he shouldchange outfits before it gets a littletoo stinky in here yeah I mean goodstart though so far so goodyeah let's go we are all wearing Jimshark which is a brand that I have beenvery curious about this is a higherimpact than the airy so everything ismore snug the sports bras are moreheavy-duty and these are a little moreexpensive than the airy stuff but not bymuchso what do you guys think I really likethe color I like the aesthetic of it allsure I like that these have pockets I'venever seen legging with pockets but Ithink this is just I'm not a leggingconnoisseur never seen it's gonna changeyour life it's a game changer yeah I putmy keys in here whoalike you said Lauren yeah yeah that'sthat I like again I have a torso issueso they just teach are gonna be wherethey're gonna be but it looks good yeahI do like them and I like the color thebra no it feels there's am wearing ashirt under it's not too flashy but Ireally like the bra and it's likesupportive it's you started to get intoit but you're okay with it now it was sohard to get into yeah I don't know ifit's because of the back of the back islike really crisscross oh that's reallyhard when you're sweaty to get in andout of so the bra looks will be easieryeah I just didn't realize it was a fastchange you know but it's supersupportive I love that and the top youcan wear is like a cute little crop topthis is what didn't see that this looksso cool I will say I'm not comfortablein it at all I usually wear a small insports bras but this around my neck isalready kind of like rubbing me a littlebit I don't know if I'm read it all butit feels like it's like rubbing me Rachdo you feel like maybe high cuts thehigh cut sports bra trend is just notfor you I feel like it fits me here it'sjust this piece that makes me feel likeit's wrong something's wrong like it'stoo tight you try to get crafty and itlooks cool but like it's not funlike this is cute for like a photo opbut it cannot keep your functionalityI'm like literally a mildlyclaustrophobic clusters living so I'mlike kind of mildly freaking out rightnowbut I'm gonna move on to the pants whichI feel like I'm pretty comfortable lookwe got the bus start with itDarren don't even start with mewell write me let me say these werereally hard for me to get into like kindof like your bra it was like I thought Iwas like I'm not gonna be able to wearthese but they're really tight whichmeans they probably won't come down butsomething that I do not love about thesepants which I should I knowoh gee oh my god Becky look at her buttthe reason why it looks so good is onebecause it's so tight but also they hadthese seams right here yeahlike puffy in this like attractive waywhich aesthetically I appreciate butfrom comfortability it's not like I canfeel this seam on my butt and like feelit like feel how rough that is it's likethat on the inside it's like hard justdon't get a hemorrhoid why would sheokay no yes so here's this reallyprocess it was it literally was likeputting on pantyhose which I wasconcerned about until they got here sojust the leg part is really tight like apantyhose which is fine that's greatI've you know my calves need support tomy complaints aren't are I can feel allthe seamsoh no don't like that like teeth yeahsureOh terrible you should be called Jimgums nagging complaint is this waistbandis really short for a high waistbandusually they are like this thick yeahand so the beauty of these of like highwaist bands is they double up the fabricaround your pooch so this it's only onepiece of fabric and here from here tohere is two so that's really flatteringand I'm only getting the doublewaistband fabrics from here to here andso it's not like smoothing out the way Iwould prefer things just be smooths outwhich just means that I feel veryexposed here and it feels very thin hereI mean but also great date pants I loveour priorities out was no different hewould eat that up look of it not thatboth really cute this is a like clearlya high impact sports bra which it's notsomething I am concerned about but ifyou are 1 billion straps and then thelittle cookie thing which I actually Ithought I was annoying but now I'm likeyeah it'd be so easy to get out of thisproblem when you're funny yeah unhook ityeah I will say overall Jim shark hasbeen the most interesting to look at theinteresting colors the interestingdesigns like I appreciate the effort andmaking it look fun and original becauseI have seen one too many sports braslike I was just wearing before but I dothink there's some elements of it thatneeds to be worked out still like theseams shouldn't feel like they feel butmaybe they wear down on their suits Iguess I'm just something so much likeman if these pants stay up then I willdeal with you on comfort because it'smore important to me that my pants dayup so should we let's do the squat testwhich I guess is more the squat test isyou all have to look through my buckokay Lucy no have we tried throwingwater on ourselvesyeah first what color show sweat I'm notwearing it wow that's bad okay okay itlike bounced off her no I don't feel anywetnessI'm not going next drew I'm good I justwant that much I was gonna keep oncalling what dry moisture managementwhat is unwiseit means bullish that means they're abunch of liars I mean what did youexpect mooster off your skin to helpkeep you dry good place like expectingit to like repel yes are my expectationsrealistic little it's fabric you knowlike it's gonna get wetdon't be cold dry dry pants true you doknow are they falling down where do notgo in anywhere they're already down Imean they feel the same do you feelthese seams on your good no they're

adifferent fabric than all the fabrics ofLululemon's that I've tried and notliked because they fall down so quicklymm-hmm it feels it already feels like 10times better than the waist bandsthe other ones I warned ya um it oddlyfeels a little too big and this is asize down then the other Louisvillewomen so that feels weird the problem isthese are fleece-lined they'recold-weather working out I'm very veryhot sweaty human and it worries me if Iwere to work out in these inside not inDenver these also come with a drawstringoh not too big anymore and I just wantto complain about what we think

I remember three years ago I was buyinggems for clothing and just hoping to geta repose I'm a roommate taking picturesof me in our dorm my main goal is to geta feature from the chip strikingserenity I would watch the cook videosand envision being able to help otherson that kind of scalethree years later I consider the gymShakti my family we worked on countlesscampaigns together then Steve's flyingin this afternoon spent a couple of daysof us in Texas I tribute the things I'veachieved - hard workmy amazing supporters in my visionI was very very skinny I was I'm talking510 511 riding about 110 pounds so I wasvery small and I've been really any onmy life you know quote-unquote outdoorsand I wanted to get bigger and strongerand so started training for strength forsize and I felt home of it so for me Igrew up in a large family so physicalfitness has always been I've been doingworkouts since I was a kid I'm one ofseven my dad was a high schoolbasketball coach and then an athleticdirector so our kind of familyactivities were going out to the trackdoing things with older brothers andsisters in the gym in the basketball gymthe minute I touched weights I was about12 or 13 electricity it was it was likelove itat first touch you know moving intocollege my first urologist when it wasalmost a new start you know I didn'thave the same friends there's a newenvironment and I was still shy it's sohard to break into it and so I looked upto a lot of people online I looked up topeople like Greg Plitt yourself Stevecook I looked up to these people I sawand I was looking to for advice and foryou know information and I just reallyconfidence to order myself a camera Inever thought that I would be able todo what I'm doing now or reach thepeople that I am now well I just wantedto document in progress and share myjourney and start tracking it I'm havinga crappy nose 19 skinny nose no not muchmuscle NASA wasn't shredded but Ithought that it'd be good to share theexperience the moment I kind of realizedthat this is what I wanted to do or whatI was looking at doing is I was 24 yearsold I just got divorced and I was doneplaying college football I was afour-year starter in college andfootball was kind of what I reallyidentified live like that's who I was Iwas a football player I thought I wasgonna play in the NFL injury and justnot being at the end of the dayqualified enough to play in the NFL ledme to kind of a realization if I didn'tknow what I wanted to be this also cameabout because I was married at 21 yearsold we got divorced at 24 I was leftkind of looking in the mirror like Loriyou're not a football player anymorewhat do you have to offer and it was youknow I didn't have a lot ofself-confidence at that time you knowthere was things that went on in mymarriage that it uh you know I felt likeyou might know wasn't where I wanted tobe completeand I was probably pretty hard on myselfbut it was that that kind of moment thatI looked at something and I picked thebodybuilding show and I thought I'mgonna give this everything that I havebecause I've seen the kind of resultsthat I can get in the gym and I know ifI can go to the gym and work my butt offfor this goal I could then take thatkind of that same mentality and apply itto any other area of lifedid a spur-of-the-moment meet up we'regonna find out how many Jim shark manhow many Jim's shocked fans we have herecan everyone said you know Steve there'sno money in this there's no money andfitness modeling and I was thinking allthe whole time I don't want to be afitness model this is my foot in thedoor to be really a fitness spokespersonor somebody that can change people'slives and I wanted to do it on theground level I wanted to meet peoplethat expose I wanted to talk to themabout my story I had so many people tellme you know I've gone through what youdid how did you get over that breakup orhow did you get over that that divorceand at the end of the day like everyonegoes through we're all share the commonthread of going through struggles inlife and it's how you deal with thosestruggles it's how you deal with gettingover those stumbling blocks and I thinkthat for me was holding on to thatvision of what I wanted down the road Iknow there there's always going to behiccups there's always going to bethings that that are setbacks but it'sjust more of an opportunity to pickyourself up and learn from it and thenultimately be a better version ofyourselfI think that's very important to notethat you're not always gonna haveeveryone support there's even peoplethat tell you it's a dumb idea there'dbe people that say you're not going tomake a living doing what you want to door that there's no money in thatjust bringing you down and I think it'sso little compared to surround yourselfwith people that share the same missionthat you do and thankfully for me havingthe support of my friends my familyI'm Jim shark Jim Chuck believes in mebefore any other company they believedin me when I was starting out with mychannel stankin system of willingand I can honestly say that I don'tthink I would be hereI'll say one thing hundreds of peopleyearly Italians of people and you knowit makes it makes up hora when at theend of the day like there's one one kidthat comes up just one kid comes up andsays you know I've lost 40 pounds fiftypound or changed my life that's whatactually makes it more worth no nomagazine covers worth that no amount offollowers or that the end of the day isthat that person's changed their lifeI think that's what you know we try toembody and I think that's why I viouslythese guys had that line today justsimply amazing happy family happy to PamI had heard of Jim shark but it wasn'tuntil I saw Christian and Mark andreally their online social presence growwith Jim shark that I realized it was aforce to be reckoned with and right offthe bat the clothing didn't jump out atme but what it was it's kind of the thevision and when I spoke with the ownersabout when we were talking about youknow where they wanted to go with thebrand and when they told me where theywanted to go I knew it was something Iwant to be on board with and he sittinghere today in this shirt this is exactlywhat I had hoped forjust the tenacity and which they goafter things they set a goal and I knowthey're gonna do it they're youngthey're visionary and they're gonna worklike hell and that's kind of what I wantto surround myself with people thataren't afraid to work that aren't afraidto put in put in the long hours becauseat the end of the day like when I'm nottraveling or at an expo my life is it'snot normal and I don't want it to be butit's the price you pay to createsomething that's gonna be long-lastingthe price you pay to to be different inthis world and I think that while we areall different everyone shares a littlebit of that I'm an individual I want tobe me and I want others to recognizethat Who I am is significant and I thinkeverybody has that in them everyone hasthat that light you could say in themthat makes them unique and whatever itis the guys from Jim sharprecognized that not only in me but intheir other athletes and they really doa good job of promoting and sharingwhich not only their visions but helpingother athletes create their vision theirbrands their their market and that's forme it was it was so it was like it waslike looking into a mirror of what Iwanted my brand to bereally it's a feel to movement that atthe end of the day you go to an expo andthe gym shark line at the end of the dayis sets itself apart by the energy thatthey're that they're kind of giving tothe crowd and people had to go speed upand there's a reason why you go thereand it's so busy people like asking youknow what is it with Jim shark like yeahit's clothing but is it really that muchbetter and while I say you know theclothing is great what sets it apart isreally that the intangible intangiblefeeling of they they know what they wantand there's nothing that's gonna stop usat Jim shark from creating the lives weall want to live and you know it evengives me just chills sitting heretalking about it wearing a a hot humidwarehouse and I have chills talkingabout that vision,27,UCPXFlFhjHP71rqhI2i4MvAQ,Jaret Campisi,51,6,0,113,"['bodybuilding', 'mens physique', 'npcphysique',

let me just show you whatthe material looks like up close here soteens tell me when it's nice and focusedso this is basically like an upgrade oftheir seamless t-shirt series if youguys have all tried those which we'revery popular some of my favorite shirtsas well these are actually it's like adifferent material completely differentmaterial it's really thin everything yousee here on meet today well in both ofthese are size medium and so I'll showyou what it looks like but you knowclassic kind of Jim shark styling Idon't know this is a I think this is theNavythey sent me both the Navy ones and thenso that's the front that's what thefront looks like the back looks likethis and they're very stretchy andfitted and sothis is a size medium and I'll show youwhat it looks like in a second but itfits very well they're super light verybreathable honestly these are probablyas far as looks go I didn't wasn't thatimpressed with them just looking at thembut when I see them on and feeling howthe material feels are so light sobreathable time one of my favoriteshirts Jim Stark has made to date so I'mvery very sick shirts so this is thelong sleeve and honestly thislong-sleeve shirt right here and navy Ithink they have it maybe they have it agray and they have it in some sort ofcrazy pink color but um this one in navyis like one of those mannish shirts I'veever worn like seriously one of myfavorite shirts for sure oh this is asize medium it fits me perfect it's gotperfect amount of length on the sleevescoming down but the fit is really coolthe way it wraps up around and thelittle things up here it makes you lookJack that guys like it kind offeels like a superhero shirtthe way that it's cut down around hereno Jim shark under there says be avisionary which is really cool that'swhat it looks like gun hugging sleevehug in there see those teens how's itlook that's fineChristina needs me that's what the backlooks like super-sick shirts they don'tgo up too much when you put your handsup they do right up with just a tiny bitbut yeah this there's SafeSearch guysthese are this is one of my favoriteshirts hands down so it's called the Jimsharks seamless devant t-shirt this is along sleeve t-shirt let me put on theshorts so you don't show you what thatlooks like in just one second okay sothis is the seamless Devon t-shirt andnavy to be honest it's weird this is amedium and I think you gotta be carefulwhen you wash these because if you putthis in the dryer in my opinion thismedium is going to become too short forme very quickly so I can never have tobe careful and not put this in the dryerthe long sleeve version seemed like ithad a little bit more length to it soI'm not sure why they did that but justbe aware of it so you could probably goup in a large if you're the same size asme in this t-shirt and get away with itso something to keep in mind it's veryhuggie you can see the sleeves thereyou're hugging there my arms are onlylike right around 16 inches so it's notlike they're huge or anything butthey're definitely sleep hugging nowthey are stretchy so you can get awaywith that and it's really cool up herewhat they do with the shoulders and makeyour shoulders like big make youlook like a badass guys so that's whatit looks like this is the short sleeveversion mary-6 shirt get some whippedgoing boom oh so there you go that'sthis gym sure I've seen miss Devonshorts t-shirt and long sleeve now let'shop right into will see the pufferjacket for last since that's probablywhat most people want to see let's jumpinto the hoodies Jin shark hoodies verycool this is a size large in the gymshark Cody's really honestly guysthere's nothing that special about thegym shirt for these it's pretty much asa normal hoodie the coolest part aboutit is the fact that this is embroideredJim sharp logo so teens you want to kindof zoom in on that so they can see whatit looks like so really it's just it'sjust a hoodie they are very comfortablebut you can see that memory which isreally nice and then they matching yeahthey match camp with that which is areally nice touch but honestly it's ahoodie so you know whatever they weregood for lounging around in the house Iwear them a lot just to kind of layaround watch movies whatever also if youdidn't go running outside or startingoff your workout for on a hoodie excuseme so that's nice to have it they have abunch of different colors that I thinkthey have a gray and black they have agray and yellow obviously the blue andblack and then they have the white and Ithink this is black I didn't really seethis one on the website so I'm not sureif this is like a prototype or somethingbut I think they have Navy and white onthe website but yeah they're nicesomething to have like they have littledetailing in there - Jim shark it'sreally cool these are size large so mystats 510 about 175 right now andvery well 43 inch waist or waist Jesus13 inch waistthey were different chests so large fitsme perfectplenty of room I could get away with amedium in these but this hoodie I wantto fit nice and baggy so nobody's andthen perfect jacket the puffer jacketand honestly guys I was so stoked whenthey sent me this it was one of thefirst products that Jim sharp sent mebefore they were even released and so wewere out taking pictures for them andstuff and that's why all this stuff hasbeen it opened and um when I got thisjacket I was so stoked because it'sbasically like a down puffer jacket whatdo they call it I forgetsecta me they call it a sector jacketthere's all sectors here they have likedown leaves in them but I love the blueand the black like I'm sucker for thisand then they've got pulleys up here ithas a hood that guys Burgin this is okayso here's the thing about these jacketguys they only sell them in small mediumand large and they run small sobasically if this mom super small so ifyou are small you're gonna need a mediumor large if you wear a size mediumnormally like I do in their shirtsyou're gonna need one that doesn't existyeah you need I need an extra-large likeso look at my hands in this and I wish Icould have got this out this review outbefore the Black Friday event cuz Ithink a lot of people are gonna begetting largest that are that don't fitthem unfortunately yeah and so it lookslike it fits fine right when I put it onit's like okay but then I can't movelike I literally cannot movethey either needed to add some stretchor they needed in my opinion this lawyershould be a medium and they should havea large that fits normal people like ifI'm a large in your hoody I should be alarge in your jacket I mean I know thatthey made them to fit they wanted themto be fitted but you guys can see Iliterally cannot wear this so I wore totake some pictures for them and stuffbut I can't wear in a superwoman theyjust look so awesome withwhatever so kind of fun without that Jimsharp if you're watching this video makean extra-large and send it to me I thinka lot of people are going to need extralarge as well so that's the jacket it'sjust a standard jacket you can see it'sgot a hood a hood here very nice jacketthey fit so nice - eyes up or added somestretch or something looks like you seewhat happens the hood is really nice youcan work out on these you can just smellthem always but normally they have apulley here just stand off to the sideand that's the the men's sector jacket Ithink that's why you see mark fitwearing the cutoff version he probablywears the larger than that as wellbecause I'm guessing the jacket didn'tfit in so anyway still an awesome jacketif you're smaller than I amprobably like five eight five nine andand under and smaller than 43 inch chestprobably like 42 and lower you couldwear these and every six I can for youso I'm sure they'll get them back intheir sold out right now but yeah that'sit that's the men's stuff so I'm gonnatake over the camera and let Christinathe ladies stuff like I said I know

"it's gone on family we are back in thegym and today we are doing a QA this isgonna be two about two-part series so Iposted an update on Instagram and alsoon my Facebook fan page so today we'regonna go in a new Instagram and we'll doFacebook another day or later on thisweek but let's go ahead and get startedguys the clips are gonna be seeing allthese clips are from the last week or soyou're gonna see some back some bicepssome chests some legs so you'll see alittle bit of everythingbut yeah I'm rocking the brand newgraphite and black gym shark tracksuitand also their new purple stringer whichyou're gonna see in these next clips butif you want to purchase any new gymshark they came out tons of new stufflinks in the description box and thenuse Guzman 10 save yourself some moneyand let's get started guys so like Isaid this Instagram got my phone in handand we're gonna kind of wing it mmmfirst question how do you bring uplagging arms number one increase yourvolume so if you're only doing twoexercises for arms maybe add a coupleextra sets at a couple differentexercises increase the amount ofexercises you're doing and option twowould be to give arms its own specificday there's nothing wrong with thatif your goal is to grow your arms thengrow your arms you know do maybe what Idid for the longest time when I wasbulking up was my priority was to growmy calves and then grow my arms so I didCasso up four or five times a week andmy arms I did push-pull leg arm off so Idid a little bit of tricep on pushed alittle bicep on pulled a legs and then afull arm day so I had the frequency inthere and the volume so try that outguys and lastly you got to be anenforcer Plus no questionsyou know ass you have to be the coresurplus to grow unless you're anabsolute beginner so I those are my tipslet's see let's see next question sorryguys I'm kind of reading through thesewhat age did you really start to growhonestly see I started at 14 years old Iwas doing shrinkagility work I did that till I was about17 17 and a half and then I startedworking out on my own and you know doingmore bicep curls and trying to change myphysique as opposed to just gettingstrong and athletic so I would say atabout 17 when I started really you knowdoing my research training on my owndoing more isolation exercises and goinga little bit higher rep as opposed toyou know the 3 to 5 rep range so 17 171/2 that's when I hit my growth spurt Iguess not height wise but as far as likemuscle goes and yeah that answers thatexercises for building the lateral headof the tricep any kind of push downsreally gonna I guess give more attentionto that lateral head the lateral head isif you're you know flexing it's thatlittle horseshoe so I looks awesome Ilike to always at least do one kind ofpush down when I'm doing triceps andnext question this is you one doeshaving thicker abs make you look moreshredded okay so when you think thickabs since we're all in YouTube here Iwant you guys to think of Chris Jonesfrom position greatness being expectingsome stuff from us pretty soon guys buthe has very thick abs she has verywell-developed apps so we're gonna usehim for an example and then we're goingto use me for an example my abs Ihaven't been training them as muchthey're not as developed and thedifference there is having thicker absis not going to necessarily make youlook more shredded but the benefitshaving thicker ABS is you don't have toget down to a 5 to 6 percent body fat tosee your six-pack if your abs are moredeveloped if they pop out a little bitmore they're gonna be more visibleyou're gonna be able to see them quickerso meaning if Chris Jones were you knowhe's getting lean pretty soon he'll beable to see his abs when he hits 8 to 9percent body fat whereas to me at 8percent at 8 or 9 percent body fat yeahyou can kind of see my eyes but youreally don't see that full six-packuntil on the 5 and 6 percent body fat sothat comes with development ABS ourmuscle just like anything else you dohave to work them if your goal is toclearly have a six-pack I mean if youthink as you know you think reallyskinny kids that are 100 1520 poundsskinny you you know vascular reallyveiny and they don't have abs the reasonis because they haven't developed thoseabs sodefinitely don't be scared to train yourabs I would recommend maybe two or threetimes a week should be plenty and yeahgrowth ABS you'll be able to see them ata little bit higher percent body fatwhich is great that's a very nice thingespecially if you're just looking tokind of stay lean it's a lot easier tomaintain an 8% body fat you around asopposed to a five or six percent bodyfat so next question let's see you let'ssee what countries do you want to visitthe most right now honestly guys Ireally really want to go to the UKthat's one of my goals I really do wantto go to the UK hopefully if the bodypowder will be able to go but that alldepends so it's kind of up in the airright now I'm hoping so support mychannel and guys will grow the channelwe'll see what happens next question letme see let me see top 3 supplementsalrighttop 3 supplements I'm gonna recommendI'm not concerning whey protein andsupplement right now guys here's wheyprotein I consider it food but if youneed protein to help get your proteingoal it should be about one gram perpound of body weight then go ahead andbuy that but other than that creatinemonohydrate 5 grams a day every singleday you can buy it in bulk for very verycheap it doesn't have to be any kind ofcracklin or you know whatever creatinenitrate 2.0 crazy monohydrate it's goingto do just fine by gramsdrink plenty of water and you will seesome strength gains so creatine isnumber one other than that guys I guessa pre-workout any of your choice Celiecore c4 is my all-time favorite ehp labsbuzz is really good yeah a lot of prettyworkouts to choose from so if you wantto buy cellucor I like the tastes reallyreally good it's my favorite taste souse bunch of discount code and cellularcomm I see blue R as my favorite butyeah so tree teen pre-workout just gonnahelp you have more energy in the gym andthat's not going to necessarily apre-workout it's not going to get youbigger or allow you to put on moremuscle but if you have more energy inthe gym you perform better in the gymyour nutrition is right that youprobably will build some more muscle sothat's kind of how it works but thirdwould just be I use some multivitaminsand fish oilthat's what I recommend and those arethe top three I would recommend so nextquestion let me see on the sea can youburn fat and build muscle at the sametime you can burn fat and build somemuscle if you if you're a beginner so ifyou're new to the gym and you're in acaloric deficit you will build somemuscle I would say for the first yearand a half you in two years and honestlyguys like I know this goes against thecontrary belief but I've been dietingfor like I said in the previous video 24out of the last 28 weeks and without adoubt guys I've seen some growth in myupper back I know my traps are grown alot I've been doing a lot of rack bullsand throughout the summer and everythingI can definitely tell growth of my trapseven though I've been an importantdeficit so I would even say it'spossible obviously it's not going to beoptimal progress you're not gonna seethe most gains you could if you're infloor deficit but if you're taking inprotein I definitely think it ispossible even a little bit later on butprimarily you're only gonna see musclegain while shedding fat in your firstyou know year year and a half oftraining so second man there's a funnyone I'm not gonna answer that's notappropriate on YouTubebut next one let's see how many caloriesdo you eat for a day currently guys I'mnot trying to be super lean you know I'mnot gonna lie to you guys and say I'monly trying to get in pound to a poundand a half a month just so I'm trying toenjoy myself a little bit like I saidhave been died you so much that I'maround 3,500 I would stay at a 4,000 aday trying to keep the best for minimumhaving pretty high carb protein is rightaround one to one point two grams perpound of body weight and yeah nextquestion is form or weight moreimportant when you're just startinglifting form is everything guys you knoweven if it takes weeks and weeks toperfect form with really light weight Iwould recommend that over using heavierweight and trying to get your yeahthat's the easy way to snap some stuffup next question opinion on keto dietwhich is all that means guys is youdon't eat I guess anything that comesfrom that's process you only need likenatural stuff that comes from the earthor whateverpretty much it's good it will work it'sa great way to lose weight initially butthe thing is it's not sustainable youknow you're not going to avoid rice andbread and pasta for the rest of yourlife so I'd much rather lose weight onsomething that's more sustainable thansomething that I can just get off and ifthat makes sense get off the dietanother thing about keto is usually thefat intake is extremely high and theprotein is ridiculously high which isnot really necessary to drop weight so Iwould personally just rather have somecarbs in my diet so that's gonnaconclude this episode guys I hope youall enjoyed it stay tuned for a secondQ&A and yeah be sure to subscribeemail me

what's up guys welcome back I just gotoff work it is Wednesday at almost 5:30I got home and I had a package waitingfor me and so I figured why not make avideo about it as you can tell by thetitle it's going to be a couple Jimshark item so what I got briefly was thenavy blue eye on stringer the coral formt-shirt this was on sale for $14 so Ifigured might as well pick it up and youfit bottoms v2 in grey so a little whileback I got a random gym shirt gift cardfrom somebody I can only imagine it wasfrom Jim shark because they had a littletrouble with an order in the processesof Yami and I'm moving from New York upto New Hampshire I was also in theprocess of exchanging a shirt I bought ashirt for somebody else and it didn'tquite fit them and they said they werefine without it anyway so I exchanged itfor a larger size for myself and theyactually ended up sending it to New Yorkand so for that trouble I guess I sentme a gift card I figured might as welluse it and pick up a few more thingsalong the way so I'm gonna take you guysthrough how I fit how they look so forreference I am 6 3 I don't know exactlyhow wide my chest or my shoulders arebut I have fairly wide shoulders I'mabout 220 pounds right now so if you areof similar size and have trouble findingclothes like I do I already have a fewof the t-shirts I have three of theirseamless Avent shirts I think it's howyou say it one of the seamless devantshirts and a long sleeve and a stringand those so I wanted to pick up acouple more items just to see how theyfit and I love the deeper stretchalready so I don't see them not fittingwell but I will take you through itso let's start off with the string I gota like I said a navy blue and it lookslike it has a white gym drug logogrowing across the front firstimpression of it it fits really well itfits really well around the back and thelats fits really Relan eck and theshoulders it's not too deep it's not tooshallow very easy toaround in which is good obviouslystringers are meant to restrict you theleast amount possible but sometimes thestringers from some companies just fitreally weird but right between theshoulder blades so you have again a nicefree range of motion which is reallynice I noticed with the devant stringerthat they also have it says it's reallyshort I think this is maybe a little bitlonger than that not too much but itdoes feel definitely a little bit longeron though if you guys can see because Idon't have a flip up screen so that isthis stringer fits really well I like itreally nice material nice and stretchy Igot this in a large and so again ifyou're looking for reference for ifyou're someone similar or around my sizea large does fit pretty well for a beingfairly wide and I feel like if I went tothe XL it might be a little too wide inthe torso but I like how the large fitsnext the forum t-shirt here's the plumt-shirt first impression I was notexpecting it to feel like this I wasexpecting it to feel more like a cottonspandex mixture but it's much cooler ithas very cool feel to it cool touch Ididn't really look at what it's made outof that tells me on here no I'll checkthe tag you might already know but Ihave no idea what's made out of but itfeels actually incredible and so I thinkthis is a slight step down from theseamless series obviously there seams onhere but it still has two Raglan sleevewhich is really comfortable good lengthso when you do reach up you're not likeshowing your belly or anything like thatso it still stays about at the waistbandbut again really cool feeling to it thisfeels really really well I math to pickup a few more of these so I got this ina large as well just like a stringer formost shirts I am a lawi fluctuate between a large and Excelfor when I am slimmer and cutting or adeficit to bulking or in a surplus so itdepends on what brand what season I'm inI guessbut right now I am a large and it fitsreally well along the lats the shouldersa lot of times the shirt will be reallynarrow when the shoulders and all ofthose feel like I'm really restrictedbut this the Raglan sleeves really helpwith that and I really like the shrimpdefinitely have to pick up a few more ofthese next the fit tapered B to bottomsjust try now I've got my camera for thiscuz obviously in that position of thecamera before will not show d-typesso I'm gonna pick it up and show youguys so these are my kona these are thetapered bottoms v2 they feel reallyreally good they are a little big in thewaistband I will say that these are inExcel so I did get an excel in thejoggers because I've gotten a couple ofthe Jim shark joggers enlarged and theyare a little bit smaller a little bitshort I have longer legs and so tryingto find something that fits the legsfairly snug while getting a good lengthis pretty tough because a large fit mylegs around pretty well but they're alsoa little short so I had to find a happymedium and going up a size is not anissue ever expecting them to shrink alittle bit when I dry them so these arethem they do have a zipper right therewhich is pretty cool if you want toloosen them up a little bit a little bitwider around the ankle then I thoughtthey might be but that's okayyou know it's not a big deal again otherthing waistband is a little bit wide butyou know again not a huge issue fitreally well around the legs the glutesand then I believe all the pockets havezippers in them cooltwo pockets in the back on the right onthe left and those are joggers got thegym track logo on the front left hip aswell as the back right bumso that is my gym shot call guysso I got the stringer the iron stringerand blue in a large the forum t-shirtand the chloral and also large but thev-2 bottoms in grey in an XL so that itguys hopefully it helped

if you were clicking on this videohoping that Jim shark finally made apair of squawk proof leggings I am NOTgonna be the one to bring you that newswhat's up guys and welcome back to mychannel or welcome if you're new Iliterally feel like I just made a Jimshark video I just reviewed a flawlessknit like two weeks ago and now they'realready making new leggings they'rereally cranking out the Lighting's veryfast and it's honestly hard to keep upif you guys enjoyed these Jim sharkreview videos please give the video athumbs up and you know I will always betotally honest with you so you will getthe details on if these are sheer ifthere's any cameltoe if they're fittingweird I do not hold back because Ibought these for my own money but todaywe're reviewing the new colors of theirenergy floss seamless which are theupdated energy seamless leggings theyhave three new colors they have thisblue they're calling this and then theyhave red and this is like tropical bluewhich is like a teal color I feel likethey're definitely going towards likethe spring kind of trends with thesecolors and they're definitely like verytrendy bright colors which I love sothese leggings are going for fifty-fivedollars which is on their higher-end ofleggings kind of than usual for themthese days honestly so the material ofthe leggings is 94% nylon 6 percentelastane and this is the same materialif the oldenergyplus seamless was so there's nochange of materials these are just newcolors but if you aren't familiar withthe energy plus seamless they might belike the tiniest bit stretchier than theoriginal energy seamless but they stillhave a lot of compression these leggingshave that kind of more slick texturethey're not at all cottony and they'rejust very compressive they do have adecent amount of stretch to them butwhen you feel them on they just feelvery tight and if you like a lot ofcompression and like being sucked in alotthese are definitely a good pair ofleggings exercising they have extrasmall to extra large which is thelargest size range I've seen from Jimshark in a while so props to them forthat too the sizing for these is alittle complex I would say true to sizefor the most part I am a small and Iwould not have strayfrom ex-life small just because if Isize up the waistband would have beentoo big on me but they are verycompressive so if you don't like thatcompression and you maybe want a littlemore space I would size up and alsothere's an issue with these that I'mhaving is that the crotch feels verytight I've gone over this in the pastthe crotch stitching on derricksleggings really doesn't have a lot ofgive and like if the energy seamlessespecially I've been having issues withthis they just feel like that's reallypulling whenever you do any kind ofstretching movements so if you're reallyinto like yoga and dance and like youreally like to do the splits and stuffthese are probably my least favoriteleggings for that just because thecrotch is so stiff and it almost kind oflike pinches my thigh like in like weirdway it's all absurd clips it just Idon't know it makes me feel like kind ofweird and it doesn't it doesn't likejust glide over your leg it kind of likepinches at it these are also afull-length on me and I'm about fivenine so with all of these leggingsperfectly lined up at the top you cansee that the Reds are the tiniest bitlonger for whatever reason and these areall size small so this waistband isshorter than the original energyseamless the original energy seamlesswas like super super high waist which Ipersonally loved but this one hits rightabout at the belly button I had somedifferences in waist fan pipe with thecolors but I'll go over that later whenI go over like specific colors there'sdefinitely lots of compression in thewaistband these leggings are alreadycompressive and the waistband is doublethickness and I kind of like thewaistband is semi flattering for mehonestly because it's so thick it kindof like can cut off your butt and lookthe middle of it or and it kind of likecuts into the love-handle region too andgonna make some like spill out so Iwouldn't say this is Jim sharks mostflattering waistband I personally prefera waistband like their flawless knitwhich gives a lot more space down hereand just as the waistband at the top sothat it doesn't cut in anywhere onthat's unflattering so have the red andthe teal lined up on this end and theteal definitely has a good centimeter onthe waist and the blue color has evenmore room on the waist so the red is thesmallest in the waistband then the tealand theit was the biggest these leggings dohave very beautiful details they have amore elongated thin eyelet detailingwhich is definitely different than theoriginal energy seamless but the same asthe energy plus seamless because theseare the energy plus seamless the eyeletsare definitely a very key part of thisdesign but just know with these eyeletsif you use a resistance band these cankind of fray and if you're not carefulwith getting your leggings on and youhave nails you can like kind of pokethrough them and get holes and runs sodefinitely you have to be very carefulwith these types of leggings I don'twear energy seamless on like datesbecause I like to use a hip circle bandand it totally just ruins these eyeletsyeah just be mindful with these thatthey are very delicate I also had nocamel toe in any of these colors there'sno front seam so it's usually kind ofhard to have camel toe there now I'mgoing to talk about all the colors allthe colors generally fit true to size Ididn't notice I had a lot of space inone or not in the other but there wassome difference in stretchiness so firstI'll talk about the red this wasdefinitely the stretch yes of the threecolors and I'm not really sure why thewaistband also was a decent amounthigher than the other colors this mighthave been duded because they werestretch here I could pull them up alittle higher but these definitely cameup to about like a centimeter above mybelly button of all the others were likeyou could see part of my belly button sothe Reds were definitely higher waistedas her cellulite there is minimalcellulite I say minimal because theseare so compressive that it does keep youin place for the most part and hide itbut there's still very thin leggings soand like there's no color or marl tohide any cellulite so you definitely arestill at risk for some now for the squattest so I just thought I would try onsome darker color underwear to see ifthey are possible to be seen and you cansee it sanikalet's just can I just have a moment ofsilence I don't know when the last timeJim shark has had a pair of squawk proofleggings it's like I just can't not onmy last two reviews these I give them a4 out of 10 I really thought the redwould be fineno you can see the booty cracked andit's full full of glory it's not cuteit's not cute and we'll notice down theline that the squat test doesn't get anybetter so squat test fail on these forsure ok next is the tropical blue andthese I give them a 2 out of 10 on thesquat test I mean this is really bad dowe need to talk about the yellowflawless knit again because this isgetting up there with that the yellowflawless then those weren't even sandproof but these are like this is thesearen't definitely a no for any sort oflight day any day that you're leaningover these are just using us goodbyesame story with the cellulite on theseand also they felt just a little bitstiffer than the Reds but they're aboutthe same stiffness as the blues but justkind of that regular like compressivelike kind of stiff under a seamless feelyou know what I meanif you've ever tried this energyseamless you'll know what I need andlastly the blue also not squat proof Iwill also give these a 4 out of 10because it's better than the tropicalblue but and maybe a tiny bit betterthan the red but still like you knowyour booties gonna be showing like Iwore like a nude underwear on these soyou couldn't see that but you can seethe skin and that's not what you wantyou don't need to be flashing everyoneat the gym so apparently energy seamlessreally aren't for life days and justabout everything else on the regularblue color it's very similar to thetropical blue in cellulite andstretchiness and all that that they feelabout the same so the moral of the storyis you can never bend over in any gymshirt leggings apparently don't know whyit's like this you'd think that theycould make some squad cruise colors butif you guys remember the original energyseamless they made it in a light bluelike this and they included those littleunderwear because they knew they weren'tsquat proof now they don't include thoseanymore they just let you show your buttto the world which I don't know what'sbetter to be honest so thank you guys somuch for watching and I'll see you nexttime[Music],26,UCbonrAHrxSXtVcdJRgOHcBA,ethercycle,6,0,0,14,"['shopify', 'ecommerce',

company okay and then likewhether or not it was like aa company that should be allowed toexist and then there isthe federal government versus kencourtrighta dude we are accusing of committingcrimes isee so in the case against kencourtrighthe in all of his filings has been likenope we were a legitimate business thewhole timei'm innocent and i didn't steal moneyfrom these people and also you coulduse i could find someone that will wantto buy the income storeand when they buy the income store allof my investors will be made wholeand therefore you can't see i committeda crime did you because likeeveryone got some money so so thereum so he's really just been taking he'snot beenplaying ball whatsoever with the fedsokay andgenerally from what i've read and youknow giventhe way that the government and theworld has gone the last few years i'velearned a lot about physical federalprosecutions because i've been payingattention to stuffuh and the everyone seems to agree thatlikethe federal government doesn't bringcharges against you unless they likecompletely have you utterly and totallynailed to the walljust can i talk for five minutes justkeep going nouh unless they have you totally nailedto the wall so like and the feds arelike they're not gonna bring it to trialunless they're justthey're just gonna wreck you andgenerally you thenyou then make a plea deal with them uhso anywayin last month uh ken courtright'sattorneysfiled with the court to not be hisattorneys anymoreoh what do you think happened there soit's either one of two things it'sgenerally uh our clientthey don't say why they're just like wedon't want to be some uhdivisions have sprouted up between usand our clientand we wouldn't be the bestrepresentation for them anymore soplease let us go uh and so thequestion is are the divisions so theycan't just quit they need permissionfrom the courtthey need permission because they youcan't just like walk out the door andleave a guy high and dryokay it's like facing federal chargeseveryone is entitled toa defense in court um but i mean i'msure the judgewas i'm sure it's pro forma for thejudge to grant that but maybemaybe i'm wrong uh so the question is isthedivision between ken and his attorneyshis attorneys are like dude you're deadlike you need to like sign a plea dealwith the feds and just like take what ittake whateveryou're gonna get yeah take the bargainand let's move on take the bargain let'smove on with our lives because thisfighting is doing no one any goodand ken is refusing to do that or is ithis attorneys are likehello we would like to be paid for ourservices and ken is like don't have anymoney anymoresorry and his attorneys are like coolwe're out of here because we're notgetting paidbut both of those theories beingentirely speculation those are bothentirely speculation but those would bethetop two reasons if you were a bettingmanyou would bet on one of those if thoseif you were a betting man the vastmajority of the bets would go onto oneof those twoand from from experience i was briefly aparalegal oh yeahyeah i worked at law firms uh most of myteenage yearsas like a little wiener who had to gorun things and likepick up stuff and like make go you're agopher check things out of course yeahpretty muchthat sounds like a paralegal no becausei didn't actually like andwasn't involved in any legal documents iwas just like adelivery boy oh you should have gonewith paralegal sounds better no i'm notagain i'm not going to steal anyone'sparalegal valor i seeuh but yeah anyway so i'm feeling likekenis being very uh in all of his filingsi've read he's been very obstinateabout what was actually going on wheneveryone seems like they got himthey're gonna they really got himagainst the wall yeah so i'm guessinghis attorneys are kind of likeyeah we're we're out of here peace outbarbara see yai'm sure he could fight if his if he'slike look i ii want to fight it tooth and nail i'msure he could find somebody that willgo along with that well he's got to payhim though okay so if all of his assetsare frozenisn't that kind of the scam like if thethe government freezes all your assetsand then you have to defend yourselfwhat do you do i don't know do you takethe public defe like are you forced intothe public defenderi mean i think so i mean i i guess ifyou have no money i meanif you're high enough if you're highenough profilesomeone will take you just for the prbut he's not high enough profilewell when do you think we're i mean withthe pandemic obviouslycertainly that has to slow these courtcases down umwhat's the is this thing gonna go on foryears oh yeah ohjeez yeah i think so i mean if he's ifhe's actually if there's gonna be likemotions on either side and likeeveryone's fighting over the evidenceand all that other stuff it's likejust drags on for years for years uhi mean there's a woman on um if you arelike extremely thirsty foryour ken court right content uh theplaces you wanna youwanna look for there's a woman onyoutube called uh amelia gardnerwho i think was involved in a lot islikeinto you know online sales type stuffum oh yeah she's gotshe has a playlist on youtube

wesuggestedand the chances are that's entirelycoincidence butyou know there's that one percent okaythat one tenth of one percent chanceit's not in which case i am honored butyeah it's it very much is 99.9 probablycoincidence anyway they hadyou really changed your tune becausewhen i said was just like yeah it'sprobably a coincidence you got somad at me i wanted the win and you tookit away from me you wereno it was exactly what we said no theylistened to usi was like okay buddy i had time togrieve since thenand now i'm willing to accept my hubrisyes uh but so they i don't know ifyou're aware there's a pandemichappening and that's really messed uptravel and they're a travel companyso if you sell luggage like this is apretty grim scenarioand they had yeah i was gonna say sincewe were talking since later on we'll betalking about jim shark's financials thethought crossed my mindto ask my sister-in-law about it whoworks in thefinancial areas of big companies she'scurrently she works in the financedepartment forairbnb and the other problem is ofcourse herthings aren't going so good for hereither oh in airbnband of course san francisco with thestate being on fireyeah that's um we have we have familywho live there and they weregiving us updates and sending photosit's scary stuff did you see it'sliterally blade runner 2049yeah it's just like all the photos itwas like 3 p.m and the sky was justred just blood red and everything isdarkand [ __ ] yeah i found it quitedisturbing it's even worse in oregon ihave friends in eugene oregon andit's like it's yeah it's straight redskyat like two o'clock so it's bright redoh jesse our project manageroh yeah that's right jesse's and yeahshe uh posted to her storiesit was it was creepy and sad to see ituh all right so we're trying to travelyeah you know by comparison to insanewildfires uh waze travel sale hardlyseems interesting yeah wellall right so away travel had aa site-wide 50 off saleand apparently this was big news becausedtc brandsare seemingly allergic toto sales in general it's like a umit's very dishonorable to run a sale indtc twitterit feels like and anyway a weight ran asales 50off the entire site seems like it mighthave been successfulbecause the site went down when theystarted the sale when people ran tocheck it outum and it was reported on thisnewsletter i read that i recommend ilike calleduh morning brew and they said umwhat did they say uh brandon louis vp ofcomms corporate affairs away told retailbrewthe sale is meant to inspire shopperswho may be ready to travel again thisfalland there's interest the ways onlinetraffic increased and recent launcheslike pet carriers and mini travel kitshave sold out uh but the sales chance tooffload suitcasesafter the pandemic flatlined the travelindustryand in april awaysco's founders saidsales had plummeted90 when travelers put worldwide vacayplans on iceum they laid off 10 of their staff andthey said if they've picked up momentumbutthey didn't specifies too much and thenmorning bruce commentary was thatdiscounts caninstantly jump start sales but away inits dtccohorts avoid them and uhthe argument being that well dtc brandsbecause it's direct to consumerhas already given you the best pricetherefore they can't do a sale and iterodes brand valueuh and they had a this poll quote herefrom uhnick sharma who founder of sharma brandslike judy is a really cool one of hisi like him a lot he said i don't thinkrunning a single sale is going to havean impact on the brand in five yearstimebut it becomes a recurring strategy forbrand then that becomes a differentstorywell when you can't sell anything rightbecause of a pandemicwhat you're running out of options yougotta turn you gottayou gotta free up cash and if you've gotthis inventory not movingit's costing you money just sittingthere the saleon stuff that you can't otherwise sellseems like a smart movei mean yeah this i want to defend salesfor dtc brands oh well this isn't goingto be fun because thisthis this article when you send it to meimmediately got my hackles up because iwas just like stopsmelling your own farts and acting likeoh well we're too important forhaving a sale you can't expect that ofus you know i never thought i'd get touse this sound effectthere you go oh delicious i work for awazetravel oh i'm now talking about oh sogood i'm gonna go yell at my underlingsnowuh that was that's the finest segmentwe've ever done on this showuh but yeah it's like oh well what'll itdo to the brand it's like[ __ ] you're not rolex like rolexhas built their entire brand around thisand they've existed for like i think 100years at this pointit's like you you sell boxes you sellboxes that people carry their clothes inthey sell polycarbonate clam shells thatare realistically no different from the60 samsonite i got clearance from amazonmany years ago got done down therethat's my clothes boxlike that's what it is that's my clothesbox what florida airplanei just throw my clothes in a garbage bagbutit's just like oh well it's really gonnakill the brand if they have sales like[ __ ] they have no saleslike you could have a sale you're nottoo good for sales no one is too goodfor salesyeah if bentley did a sale suddenlybentley becomes more attractiveoh well they're doing it to inspirepeople like [ __ ][ __ ] [ __ ] inspired my [ __ ] bankaccount yes yeah no cli don't think they said other look guyswe need to inspire people to travelyeah no they're like what are we goingto domy godyeah it's just like if it's like youknow a brand should just sit there andbe like well i'm only gonna eat if yougive me caviarit's like okay well if you're only gonnaeat caviar have fun starving to deathlike i'd rather throw a sale instead ofstarving to death and that is exactlythe situationas you sell suitcases you sell expensivesuitcasemoderately expensive suitcases andno one is no one's traveling andcertainly so no one's buying luggageyeahyou don't want to go out of business soall right and they've shifted to thingsthat they can selllike pet carriers uh so continue thatshift it clearance the stuff thatdoesn't selli don't know why there's thisimplication thatwithin the realm of dt direct toconsumer e-commercethat that is in some way a shameful actthat to me that sounds strategic andsmart you know it's a direct to consumeruhdtc uh e-commerce brand what appledoes apple have sales yes okay so i'mpretty sure you're fine not oftenand they're light those black fridaysales back school salesthey do yeah how about like fiftypercent off give me i want airpodseveryone's got sales i mean sales haveexisted for what 100 yearshow long has sales existed oh it'sgee i have no idea that's a goodquestion it's a good question and youknow what you just reminded me of youknow what was itwell i don't know if sears was likesears like sears would made things andsears would send you a catalogi think sears was the original dtc brandi think ford was the original dtc brandyou could only buy it from a for a fordyou could only buy from a forddealershipand they owned the entire manufacturingprocess and streamlined itfor efficiencies and the goal was youknow low price direct consumer productcut out the middlemanoh then i think clearly four i thinkford should be trading at whatever like20 times earnings is then because i meanthey're a dtc brandi think it is funny to think of likethat somewhere along the waye-commerce rebranded itself as direct toconsumeri mean that's why i mean the searscataloginstead of they just they'd send thewebsite to your houseand you'd flip through it yesyeah there's a lot of they a lot ofthings that we act like oh this is newand amazingit's not it's the same stuff so manythings in our lives especially inbusinessit's just like stuff borrowed from otherindustries orstuff taken uh that happened so long agoyou forgot about it and we just kind ofrelabeled it and reinvented it formodern agebut no i don't fear the sale i mean ifit's in their case it's choosing betweenlike well we could sit here and sellnothing or we could clear up the stuffand use that cashto sell um you know to develop and sellnew products they're great good for themthat should be the storywell but i i mean i'm just taking it astep further insteadyou know anyone listening to this even imean i knowwhatever um pierre escargo the ceo ofbentleyuh i'm sure he uhhe's not listening to this but anyonewho is listening to this you can have asaleyou don't need to be going out ofbusiness to have a sale please for thelove of god to have salesbecause more people will buy your craplike what why is this hardthe yes and like the umis bentley french it's probably notfrench it's british damn ityeah i should have been like nigelhuffninglenigel huffnaglehey you know what harry potter harrypotter's the ceo of bentley there you goyes there you go all rightum and the queen is the ceo of jaguarthat'swow that's my the extent of my mybritish knowledge oh and that's why youjust sold your jaguar because you'reanti-royalistyou know i still have the jaguar sittingin my garage mocking meah every time i get in the car it callsme a colonist and spits on melike what what did i pay for this uh allright soyeah i think i get wherelike so the fear with sales like if youran sales constantlythat it devalues the brand and likeunless you're areal unless you're you're selling aluxury good where it's like all right itiswe're selling this thing at 10x cost ofgoods soldyou're probably not really a luxurybrand but i'm even saying luxury brandis in likewhen we think of like you know luxurybrands like bentley and rolex andwhateverthose are luxury brands that are likethis is only they have a story historythis is only meant to be purchased bymillionaires yeslike come on yeahso the you're not one of thoseso i have a sale statistically probablyyeahmaybe someone at bentley is like whati'm leaving a one star review i don'tknow i mean if you work for bentleycome in contact with us we'll build yourshopify store i don't think it's gonnawork you know what don't don'tit's hard because they're totally gonnawant like a product configurator app toconfigure all like the differentthis is basically the hardest thing youcould do those are horrible i don't wantthat jobyeah they're very difficult i respectpeople who could build a productconfiguratoryeah one for a vehicle oh my god nothank youuh all right so last timewe jim shark came up and i as part oflike the gymshark explanation i saidthey've got this billion dollarvaluation and you said what the heck dothey sell i said i don't know stuffonline and you said well they sell abillion dollars worth of stuff wellfirst off you said it was two and a halfbillion which we've now learned wasdefinitely wrong oh yeah it was waywrong1.4 billion i believe it turns out isthe valuation all right so that's stillunicorn statuswhat is what do you have to do to getunicorn status what does that meanyou you're you have a company with a uha a three-comma valuationa billion dollar valuation is that athingyeah i didn't know that yeah all rightyeah no that's the thingthat's unicorn status okayuh and anyway so i poo-pooed it anduh because i will happily say wheneveri'm wronguh i was wrong uh they sound like theysell some stuffuh they don't sell 2.6 billion dollarsworth of stuff whatever kurt said yeahthat's a number i literally turned out ijust made up butuh he was also correct to chastise methey're not built entirelyon a wing and a prayer of softbank andsaudi money soi'm willing to give them a little bitmore benefit of the doubt and what'suh i think what's very interesting aboutgymshark it was started byuh two guys who were 19 years old in2012.that i mean e-commerce is sucha young young industry andthing and to think like wow 2012 that'sa lifetime agoin e-commerce and two kids who were 19now own acompany with a billion dollar valuationoh good for thembut uh i was christian linkedin and wehad a past guestuh jason andrew who is a uh a charteredaccountantin um uh on the other side of the globeand he gave us this really good rundownof like okay here's how to approachaccounting for e-commerce that is hisentire thing is being a cpa forbootstrapped high-growth e-commercecompaniesand i saw he had written a mediumarticle that was very good where he'slike all right let's break this downis this valuation legit and so ii i passed along to you uh i did notactually read it myselfinstead i emailed him and i said heywe're going to talk about that on theshow would you mind giving us a dramaticreading of that would you mind giving uslike here's the executive summary inaudio formand so he very kindly did and i'd liketo play thatnow make a heart rule hey everyone it'sjason hereit's a pleasure to be on the unofficialshopify podcast now gymshark is one ofthe fewpureplay ddc brands that have officiallyhit unicorn statusi'm sure there are others flying underthe radar but this is the bestcase study i've personally come acrossnow it's unique in many waysfirstly the founder ben francis he'ssuper young he started the company whenhe was 19 years oldbut secondly it was bootstrapped upuntil the investment from generalatlantica rare quality in this environment whereevery large consumer brandseems to be raising buckle loads ofmoney rightly or wronglyare these qualities which make gymsharkso impressive in my eyesnow my accounting firm works with a lotof bootstrapped high growth businessesand what ilove about working with bootstrapfounders is that by necessity they needto equip themselves with strongoperating discipline and financialgovernance from day onethese are good habits for everyentrepreneur to build an early stageas they carry through the business as itscales now many outsiders see jim sharkas a company withawesome marketing and leadership and ican say that the hype is supported byequally strong financial managementsome key highlights from financialperspective healthy gross profit marginsthat hover between43 to 50 percent now the operatingprofit margins have remained consistentat 11 to 20 percent even as the companyhasscaled in other words the unit economicsof gymshark workwhich has enabled profitable sustainableand healthy growthnow from a working capital perspectivejim chuck's cash conversion cycle was anenviable48 days in 2019. now compare that tolike nike adaswhose cash conversion cycle hovers at104 and 160 days respectivelysimply put gymshark is a cash generatingmachinein summary gymshark is a refreshing casestudy forevery entrepreneur to reflect on itserves as a stark reminder to thoselooking to scale their ecommercebusinessand the key message is this you don'tneed to raise venture capitalto build a great high growth businessfund your company with customers it'sthe best way to do iti absolutelylove his takeaway there oh the end yeahthe end is themain thing to focus on yeah i think thethere is there is some bias and i i'veseen some arguments onlinewhere like people bootstrapping versusumtaking investment whether that's privateequityventure capital whatever it is um andthese people fighting butt headsi think clearly it's your business youshould dowhat the heck you want right do thething that you know is right for youthat you feel comfortable withbut there was always this implicit thingthat like well if you're bootstrappedthat's just a lifestyle business likelifestylebusiness was very much used derisivelyi've only recently been willing toaccept lifestylelike we have a lifestyle business it's afabulous business that supports ourlifestyleyeah i mean it's a thing where if we ididn't know of it derisively at allwhere i was just like it's a lifestylebusiness it's like this business is mylifestylei'm like okay waiting for the bad partyeah right that's silly but it's itderisive becauseuh the implication with lifestylebusiness isyou can't it's not high growth you'renot gonna beyou're not gonna be worth tens ofmillions and you're certainly not gonnasell your light your little lifestylebusiness that's cutefor 200 million dollars or something tothat effect let aloneget a billion dollar valuation andwhat jim shark has shown us is thattwo regular dudes i mean literally thisguy was a 19 year old pizza delivery boywho started silk screening t-shirts wereable to growbootstrap so they did not takeinvestment a business and thenafter steadily stacking the bricks inthat for a decadeget to or almost a decadeget to a billion dollar valuation whenthey finally did takethat investment so these these thingsare notthese two approaches are not at allmutually exclusive noand even if it's not exclusive it's likeoh no you failed i mean it goes back toour story with umgumroad with uh salil from gumroad whereuhyou know his his uh gumroad he had abunch of ec moneyand he failed at building the startupandinstead now he just owns gumroad himselfoutrightmoved to salt lake city and makes likehalf a million dollars a yearby himself yeah i think uh pretty mucheverybody listeningcould live with that business yeahthat's the thing because no stress he'slike i failed becausegumroad didn't turn into a 100 millionmulti like billion dollaryou know exit for me uh all it did was ihave a job that i kind of workin my own house that i lived in thatthat is not in san francisco and i makehalf a million a yearlike oh no oh nohow will he survive right and so thatlike that was kind offor someone who chose to have abootstrap lifestyle business like wewe've never had debtum we've never taken investment theand i have intentionally chosen toremainuh uh to have a small team and keepthings as simple as possiblebecause i am risk-averse and prone toanxietyand i don't like anxiety no so i'vebuilt the business arounda system where it supportsgot a cool place yeah it's all good weall we own houseswe have cars we're not scared about likepaying our mortgage next monthno uh it's pretty it's pretty sweet yeahbutlive comfortably and largely stress freeand that was my goal and if that's yourgoaland you're like look that's that's all iwant simple goalswith uh living an upper middle classlifestyleabsolutely you could do it i mean ithink we've mentioned this before butwe've had people approach us they'relike all right here's the move you gotto do nowyou got to like triple your head countso you need to like take out a giantloanright then hire 50 people and then findthe workto keep those 50 people employed andthen you become a big ass businessthat's doing whatever revenuewith your new giant head count and theneventually someone will want to acquireyou100 we could do that and i'm like that'sthe worst thing i've ever heardif we did it we might be successful atitand or we could fail miserably and blowourselves upwho knows but like it's a risk-rewardscenario i havei have stuck to the level of risk iliked yeah andit has worked in the few because wedon't have the debtuh that in the future that could changei could say all right well you knowlet's take the investment let's buildthe big teamlet's do do the whole thing and then setit up so it's all systems of processesand we could sell it umyou could still change your mind even ifyou're like look a bootstrap nowi'm happy now but maybe down the road iwant to change it you can absolutely dothatand that's that's what jim shark did andthat's why i like thesejim shark and these two guys and havinggone deeper into the storyum absolutely i i respect it and itshould be should be held up as auh a shining example of what you coulddoin e-commerce with a shopify storethey're on shopify plusuh back to gymshark uh their money for aseconddebt cash i just want to point out theirlittle sneaky thing they didhe mentions in the medium article thathe wrote about this soum for the big brands like nike adidasand lululemontheir gross profit margin is like 45 to50which is like good for apparel umjim shark is like oh yeah ourprofit margin is 70 because we're dtcgeniuses and this is the magic you getwith dtcbut the little thing that they did whenthey're reportingtheir financial information isthey've placed uh their distributioncostswhich is like shipping customer servicerunning the website doing all the stufflike doing all the stuff that would befor nikewhich is the nike supply chain to shipeverything to all the stores everywherethey are counting that all underdistribution costs which apparently isnot part of your gross profit marginnormally i don't know about this i'mjust reading this in the articleand so what they do is they add all thatstuff after they've calculated theirprofit which iswhat you normally would do but becausethey're dtcthe way that that's put together forthem is entirely different like theythey need to do all that stuffin order to sell the product becausethey're direct to consumerso they have no distribution network soreally that should be counted as part ofthe cost of the goodsis all of this stuff uh so they'reyou think they're misreporting cost ofgoods sold their misreporting costs thatgoes i don't think that that's whatandrew says in his articleokay that they're misreporting costs agood cost of uhcost of goods sold because they becausethey're direct consumer they have to doa bunch of stuffthat balloons their costs of thatballoons their distribution costsokay and because of that when you addall that intheir profit margins are 40 to 50 justlike all of the other companiesi see so but still i mean even includingthat stillhuge i mean incredibly successful we'recomparing them to nike adidas andlululemonbillion dollar company yeah companystarted by two guys in 2012.i'm not saying that it's like bad i'mjust saying is thethe unicorn is a little he's got alittle limp in one of his hopesi understand and well as long as we'reon the topic of gymsharkwe should do a gymshark teardownjimshark.com we're

thegym shark sale 2020uh up to 50 offselected lines all that's left to do isexplore the discounts and prepare yoursportswear wishlist but remember thegymshark sale will only be around for 24hoursyou know it's fine we are like totallynot the target market here extremely notyeah so but it was a hard given wetalked about it and the valuation it washard to ignorebut yeah we're totally not gym ratsno no it's like it's not stuff i wouldwear neither of us would but i like thatthat they were likethere's a sale it's only occurring for24 hours get goingwhen you're doing a sale absolute likethe thing was that you don't want toalwayseverything's always on sale like youdon't want to be kohl's right yeahor macy's where it's always it feelslike it's always on sale and you knowlike well if it isn't on sale i just gotto waityeah yeah um theversus the like jim shark hereabsolutely you want to time box thosesalesto create urgency um i mean it was 24hours how much money did they make that24 hoursreally tens of millions of dollarsi would hope so yeah maybe i don't knowifit's an impressive brand that's for surei'm sure everything they do has likedramatic ripple effects uh let's goto everybody loves hoodies let's for acollection go tomen's hoodies all right do they havejedi hoodiesi don't believe they sell jedi robes nopretty cool if they did i would if theyhad a star wars line i would be veryexcitednow we'd be talking now i'd be a gymshort customeruh scrolling down they've got or in thecollectionthey've got this lovely banner imagewith the the collection titles over thebanner imageand these very clear easy to useuh collection filters i love these atthe topthey're not hidden they're easy theyworki'm very impressed by i love that it's abar which leaves way more room for thecollection gridand then what like because thecollection grid has more roomthat allows the images to be biggeranytime you can err on the side of theimages being biggeris a good one 100and all right so i've got scroll down tonew there's newi like their old new badge it's nicecritical hoodie dark green 45i note that they don't sell 3xl again ohi'mi feel very abandoned herewe'll find you we'll find you a 3xlhoodie buddyi don't want to ugh sleeves i get so hotuh all right he's not kidding umi appreciate that you uh i'm on theproduct page they use breadcrumbsi don't want to like breadcrumbs but ihave found consistently over and overacross all categoriesbreadcrumbs on a product detail page getused people use them to go back to thecollectionor the homepage wherever uh so on thecollection grid oh okay so this is aquestion we get a lot in the groupon the collection grid the top thinghere is this crest hoodieand the crest hoodie is broken out intomultiple colors and each color has itsownimage associated with it and then ohyeah you're right and so if you clickthrough if you click through the red oneit has size and then it has the colorsbut when you click on the colors on theproduct pagethat is a completely separate productlisting so they've split outeach color is its own separate productwe get a lot ofquestions we get a question about thatall the time in the group oh yeah yeahif you hover over it you can see it'sdifferent lengthsi'm sure this is like metafield madnessto make this workthere's like apps that do it oh really ithink but at the same time at like theirscale they could build a private app todo whatever they wantyeah or i'm sure like you know theycould call toby and be like we reallywant this featuremaybe toby's like get out of here iplayed starcrafthe does play starcraft he playsstarcraft the man enjoys starcraftuh interesting way to lay out theproduct photosit is a more editorial style it insteadof thumbnails it's likethree images across a big image and thentwo images across the bottomwe did something kind of like this onadam's polishes and it worked well ireally liked itdo you have one with a video the one i'mlooking at does not have a videoclear video look like the differentcolors switch all right i'm looking ati'll switch to charcoal marl oh yeahthat'll have one okaywhoa oh [ __ ] okay so i always tellpeople go should i add videothe answer like say no more the answeris yes videolooks professional it looks engagingthis as far as video being executedis truly phenomenal and what's fun aboutit the video starts and ends with theguy walking into frame and out of frameso it's got kind of there's like a funumbenny hill quality to it how was it likebenny hillyeah that they're messing with like theframe you just want to hit the buttoni didn't even hit the button this videowas 720ptoo huh it's huge but what about theirpage speed scorewe're not talking about that this weekoh sorry no it'swow that this product page this photolayout with a videotruly impressive and that's really niceoh at the bottom on this one it's got abutton says load more imagesand then it flips the images tosomething else okayif i click them ah all right so then ifyou click an imageit loads in this really nice light boxbut it has all your thumbnails down thesideso they've gone with an atypical layoutwhich is a risk but they haveexecuted it so well it entirelymitigates the riskyeah they got a little position stickygoing on theform as well as you scroll down throughthe images yeah that's coolis always there that's nice that's verythisthis is very nice oh yeah it is if iclicksize guide they've got a nice size guiderelevant to the product tells meoh i could choose between inches andcentimeters umand uh even tells you how to measure thethe size guide is on point and thenunderneath the add to cart buttonit says um it's got after pay and clarinhere two financing optionsinteresting interesting choice that thedescription one is closedyeah the description defaults to closeso they use an accordionmenu for the description and it'sdescription delivery and returns reviewsthe item is new that i'm looking atdoesn't have reviews umit's got a bulleted description whichhonestly i wouldi would default it to open and at thesame time like these products are fairlyself-explanatorythese products pretty much like do youthink this looks cool yes no yeah and sothe images are the thing that sells it idon't need to be like okay but how manyarms does the sweatshirt haveyeah right the sweatshirt i think thefont is too small toobecause i'm old there ever oh cheatersyeah it's 12 point font it's tiny iwouldlike if i still want to keep that smalllook i'd bump it to 14but my ideal minimum for font size is16.but let's go back to the debate sothere's always a debate in thegroup about whether you should split outvariants by color and make every colorits own producti don't like that but either do iwant it all on one page jim sharks doingit well yeah but they also have a hybridapproachyeah where i can pick the photos like icould choose the other colorsfrom any of the product listings that'sthe differenceand that's why we say like we'll bundlethem together because you got onelisting to promoteand i could flip through the colors allon one page yeah and so they did thatand that they do have them as allseparate productsbut the swatches they still have colorswatches on every product pagethat will lead you to that product yeahand then by doing that then they alsoyou could see all of them at a glance inthe collection gridso they have combined and solved forthis problem entirelyit's very clever all right so i've gonewith an xl i've selected it click add tocartand it's got cute cute little animationto confirm it and then it opens a drawercarti think the animation is nice but youcould skip it just have it open thedrawer cardonce i'm in the drawer cart very minimalnothing to itso there's some opportunity there andyou can add a lock icon to the checkoutpaypal did a case study supposedly thatincreases conversions umwell enhanced you can have the i wouldsay like they've got this free no hassle90 day return policythat's a big deal i would like andthat's one line of text i would havethat in the cart draweryeah they can get some upsells in theretoo like buying a hoodieall right i'm going to click check outbuy the cheap because i have yet you'reright there has been no cross-sellno upsell oh my gosh by the time you getto the checkoutit's been styled it is a a custom styleduh shopify checkout very very raredid you get to it i i accidentally wentto the checkout when i wanted to checkout the cartno um no dynamic checkout buttons on thecartno but once you're in the checkoutyou've got uhexpress checkout appears and it'soffering me paypali don't know like if it were on my phoneyou know they offer me apple pay how dothey get these buttonthese things up here that are likeinformation shipping payment that's notthe standard shopify checkout oh exactlythat's why i wanted you to see this yeahwellthey're on plus it's a custom checkoutbut yeah they have changeduh they have like custom steps stuck uphere that's very cool that's cooland then this covid question that'sgreat we're still shippingit'll be contactless delivery pleasekeep an eye on our covenant 19 faq pagewhich they smartly did not link tooh come on guys no i they want it thatthis is a squeezeyou don't want to leave them yeah idon't want them to have i got them tothe checkout i don't want them to leaveto go read an faq about covet 19. targetblank manyeah you could do that um no this isreally goodso then once we get into shipping methodit's just a standard delivery four toseven working days five bucks expressdelivery one to three working days 15bucksyou would not believe the amount of overcomplicatingpeople do with their shipping when itshould just be like give me the standardoptionand the faster option and that's it andthe standard option should ideally befreeprobably with a threshold for them it's75 bucks we're below it yeah it's likedo you wantfree but slow or fast but expensiveyeah no this is good i i was talking toa merchant this weekwho does not have a billion dollarvaluationand had um so why are you shipping rulesso complicated it required a six-pageflow chartand my advice was like this is insaneyou'd wildly simplify this for your sakeand the customersand well clearly jim shark did but allright so my point is like don't givepeople choice paralysis don't tear yourhair out with shippingum simplify it if you can and jim sharkhas done a wonderful example of it hereuh overall i mean this site reallywith the exception of like the mega menucouldcould be polished up with that oneexception the rest of the site is quiteextraordinaryyeah no it's a extremely good site gradeait was clearly made for young thincool people i am an old fatloser so this was not meant for me ijust want tomake the font bigger i can't

hey guys it's Hannahso longtime new top briefly I'm justgonna let you know I went to Mexico toCalifornia I had my birthday wasyesterday um I've been trying Oh alwaysI'm trying to kind of get myself back ontrack I've been trying to get mycosmetology license out here in Oregonyada-yada point is took a break fromYouTube because I feel like I was kindof putting a lot of effort into it andnot focusing on things that I needed toget done other than that so I am heretoday with a Lulu Lemon Ohlike do you see this like all right guysso this is a collective haul most ofthis was from yesterday for my birthdaysome of the stuff I acquired like withinthe past month when I went to Californiaand Portland and things like that soI'll show you the things that I've hadfor a little while a little while firstand then at the very end I'll just showyou a couple things that order from Jimshark um alright so I guess the firstthing I purchased in this group is goingto be these wonder under roll down pantsdon't worry I'll try everything on soyou can kind of see how it fits and I'm5 foot 9 for those of you wondering sothese are the wonder under roll downs Ican personally go in a 6 or a 4 in thesethese ones I always rip the tags offbecause they always bug me but I thinkthese ones are a size 6 so I got theseand they're really really soft andstretchy and I love the pattern it'slike such a pretty floral print and thenthese ones you can wear high-waisted orroll them down kind of more like yogapants style so if you ate a lot where ami wasted and they'll suck you inotherwise you can roll them down andthey look really cute too and then inthe back they have like the little itprobably can't even see it but they havea little Lululemon in here and there andI just reallylove these pants all right the next pairof pants I got was in Californiaactually I got these ones in Portlandright when I got back but though thesame exact style of pant like the hothigh-waisted ones but these ones aresize 4 so they're a little more snug onme what's actually alike they're in thiseggplant maroon II purpley color andthen they have the Lululemon there andthen when you roll it down it has on theother side as well so I got these pantsand then I had gotten this sports brathat's the exact same colorum oh crap I forgot what this is calledI think this is the free to be wildsports bra you'll see what it looks likeon and I'll put everything in thedescription I'll link as many of thesethings as I can find they're still onthe website but this is basically itit's a shorter like sports bra this wayand then my energy one so it doesn'tcover as much about Li how many can youcover so that's not a huge issue for meand then the back is super coat I likethese ones because as you you'll be ableto see in the video when you wear likeracerbacktanks it kind of pokes out and then alsoyou have like this really cute like thinband at the bottom and then you have thelittle Lululemon on the corner and yeahthere's worth those are really amazingquality I can't stand sports bras thatlike dig in or cut or just like I don'tknow like I just I'm really obsessedwith this or super bra and it matchesthose pants all right so we're going tomove on to what I got for my birthdaylet's start with a big oneMichael got me this bag I've beenwanting and I really glad you did it'son the website price in a store anymoreat least of the one we went to sowrinkled frumpy the bag it's huge youguys this is it it's like a giant duffeland I saved the tag since I just got ityesterday this is the sweat and go bagso I really love this color I think thatin the fall time it'll be really prettywith some maroon type clothing andand the summertime is perfect it's anice light color and it's got the rosegold blue the lemon right here and ithas like a pocket here a little zipperpocket here and then you open the top ofit and it says sweat it and forget it ithas like a little like bathing suitbaggy in here it comes with another likelittle baggy inside it's got pockets andthen it's got like a perfect pocket bikehere that I like to put my laptop in soyeah if you guys want like what's in mygym slash person but a video let me knowbecause this is my new favorite it'sgood for like going to the gym goingovernight places I stay at hotels likeonce a week with Michael for his job sothat is perfect so he got me a Michaelalso got me these shorts I don't haveany workout shorts because I'm not a biglike shorts persons I'm usually supersuper pale but now that I've beenself-tanning I really wanted theseLululemon shorts so these are the UMwhat the sport short and I love thislike stripy pattern they have like coolpockets on the side there are pretty bigpockets too and then they say lululemonathletica on the band and then they havelike a little Lululemon and being righthere and then on the inside they havelike a little pocket and then they alsohave a drawstring so you can make surethat they're fitting properly and thenthese ones are a 4 inch inseam sothey're a little bit longer soespecially people like me are reallytall and have long long legs these areperfect because they're not superhoochie short so owen other-- storyMichael had to order these fromAustralia from a place called stylerunner because they don't have thispattern on the website anymore so if youare looking for these go to style runnercalm and that's where Michael got minethe next few things I got I boughtmyself for my birthdayhow cute right now the first thing Iknew I just wanted to get a plane likeone of these tanks thisis the swiftly racerback and I like ityou probably can't see I don't know butit has kind of like the Lululemonembossed into the fabric and then italso has a little sign up here and thenit's got um like little patterns maybeyou'll be able to see it better when Itry it on this I'm not gonna lie to youthis is a size 2 which is weirdsomewhere on my throat I'm over 6 in thesports bras yeah so this is $48this is like a paper-thin tank top so ifany of you understand why this specifictank top is $50 please let me knowbecause I have a no freaking clue thenext tank top I got I kind of understandwhy it's more expensive and you'll seewhen I try it on what it looks likereally because it looks kind of grosslike this but it's this really cool armygreen kind of heathered and it's gotlike a super high weird neckline I'venever seen any shirt like this beforeespecially not a workout shirt but Ilove it it like covers up here so ifyou're like bending over to lift weightsup or like doing anything like thatnothing is going to show not that I haveanything to show but then the back dipslow so if you wear any of those coolsports bras they'll still show and ithas like ventilation all over it likeyou can't really tell but the way thefabric is placed like it's gonna bereally Airy so if you sweat and it's allscrunched on the side so it hugs you andstays on your body it doesn't like rideup on you and then it's got the littlewound women in the corner this is theend the flow tank and this was fifty twodollars but the quality of this one ismuch better feeling to me personallythan the other one I mean I love it theminty color is really pretty and it'spretty but this one is like really wellmade and I understand why it costs whatit does so this one I definitelyrecommend if you want something a littledifferent it's definitely going to be apiece that not a lot of people will havethere's only like two in this store nextpurchase is going to look really strangewhen I hold it up you see which way itgoes so I got these pants that looksuper weirdand these are the in the flow crop - andI usually don't wear crop leggings tothe gym but I figured since it's gettingwarm outside and summery like I shouldget some things that are not justfooling fans I really like wearing fulllike pants I don't know why I just dobut these when you put them on this partlooks more normal but this fabric islike it's nothing I've ever felt beforelike this is the absolute thick as italmost feels like a thick sweater Idon't know like it's just like the supersuper thick fabric and then thewrenching on the sides and I mean I'veheard how am i see people wear thesepants I picture them being really thinmaterial but no this is friggin thickand then it's kind of got the Lululemonembossed like in a big circular thing onthe buns then you've got the little logohere and then the actual pattern ofthese I don't know if you can tell butit's like a chevron II type pattern so Ireally like these and these were 88which you know right so last thing fromLululemon is gonna be these high x panor perfect length for short people likethe perfect full length for short peoplebut for people like me who have reallyreally long legs these are gonna be inbetween a crop and a full pan so kind oflike an ankle pant which is kind of funbecause I don't have anything like thatand they're high-waisted they come rightto my belly button and then they're thiscool pattern and then they have thisreally cool like black detailing on themthese aren't really like the roll downones but I guess you could but these aremore like they fit perfect perfectthey're not as high-waisted as thehigh-waisted ones but they are stillhigh waisted so they've got it's justreally cool pattern on them and then Ijust really liked this like cutoutdetail and then it's black like I knowlosing them and makes them with meshcutouts too but I really like the blackone I think it looks a little lessscandalous for the gym the last twothings I got I ordered from gym sharkwhen they weren't out of stock I alwayshave a stock of everything likeseriously like I don't understand how acompany does well when they literallyarestop all the time but that does not stopme from stocking their website 24/7waiting for something to show up anywayI got thisJim shark seamless tank top I think theystill have this in stock it has thelittle Jim shark logo the quality ofthis top is amazing it says Jim charwritten on this side it's super thin butsuper super soft and sweat wicking andit fits like a glove and I absolutelylove it I wasn't expecting to like thisshirt that much but I do in the color isjust like something and then I got theoh crap are these the Flex legging I'lllink them below if I can find them but Igot these leggings when they launchedand I love them the Jim shark legginghype is definitely worth the height Icannot wait until they get their otherones in stock actually checked thismorning and the ambition leggings areback in stock but they don't have extrasmall so I'm gonna wait but when theyget more the leggings back in stock I'mdefinitely going to order everything butthese ones have the blue band thatmatches the shirt and it says Jim sharkand then these are a material I've neverexperienced before like it's not whatyou would think you just have to trythem when they're in stock but they havelike this weird ruching at the back ofthe knee here and it just kind of helpsthem form to your leg it's really niceand thick but it's like breathable soyour knee doesn't get all crunched upand then here at the ankle it has a nicelittle stripy detail and these um are alower rise and they definitely make thebutt a look nice so I am loving my Jimshark stuff I cannot wait to get moreand then that was only at Lululemonstuff and you've been to Lululemon youknow that that is a lot of stuff forthat store because everything is reallyreally bringing expensive but I wasfortunate enough to kind of gather thosethings all I really wear on a day-to-daybasis isand workout clothes not all women butworkout clothes so I felt it better toinvest in things like that versus justbuy a bunch of clothes that are justgonna go sit in my closet alright guysso I am going to Santa Cruz andSacramento next week um I'm gonna try tosell them as much as I can but otherwiseif you guys are wondering where I'm atthat's where I like to fill me inCalifornia because the lining is likebut anyways um and then do a life updatevideo or something if you guys want tosee like a gym lookbook how I'd actuallylike style these pieces let me knowotherwise I just tried them on randomlyin the trial I'm so give this video athumbs up if you liked it don't forgetto subscribe while you're here pleaseplease please and have a great dayalright bye

"losing the closest person in my lifesent me on a real lonely path one yearago I was having some pretty darkthoughts about life which I'm not proudto admit but I was scared confused andalone strangely enough I found comfortin YouTube I reached out to the entireplanet through YouTube and the worldreally supported me it was what I hadbeen missing a year later I'm sponsoredby Jim shark and I've been asked to befeatured in the my vision series to methat's Testament enough to where myvision has taken mewhat is up YouTube todayyouI can still remember it like it wasyesterdayit was December 20th and my mom hadpassed away she passed away from aterminal illness she had colon cancerand it was a really long battle shebattled for about a year and a half andto put it short my mom was my bestfriend she was my worldshe was a single mom my dad not a partof my life so just her and I growing upwe had a really really strongrelationship after she passed away itfelt like everything in my life was justfalling apart right in front of me likeall the control I once had was justslipping out of my hands and I had mybrother I had my aunt I had family to bethere and support me and help me throughthis I wasn't alonebut regardless losing a parent is one ofthe most painful experiences thatanybody could ever go through especiallywhen it's the only parent you have andso naturally I fell into a really reallyreally deep depression I didn't want tosocialize with anybody I would sleep for12 hours a day I didn't want to go towork I didn't want to go to school I wasjust losing myself completely and on topof that I fell right into an eatingdisorder andthe eating disorder didn't come onbecause I was unhappy with my body or Ifelt overweight or anything like that itwas merely that I felt like I had lostcontrol of every aspect of my life aftershe passed away that the amount of foodthat I took in or how frequently I waseating that felt like the one thing thatI could I could control and that nobodycould tell me would change it was mything and when you get into thatmentality it's really really dangerousI went from 105 to 110 pounds and Idropped down to 80 to 85 pounds so itwas really really terrible on my bodyand I remember going to the hospital foran annual checkup and my doctor lookedat me and said if you keep this up likeif you keep doing this to your bodyyou're already having issues with yourperiod you're eventually going to takeaway any chance at having kids one dayand so if that's not a clear indicationthat I was completely destroyed my bodyI don't know what is so this depressionand this eating disorder really tookover the last three four years of mylife after she passed away and I wasjust in a really really really darkplacearound this time I had just startedworking at a salon I just finished upmaybe two years prior getting my licenseas a cosmetologist and it was kind ofweird because I was really not making alot of money obviously I was assistingand as an assistant you don't reallymake very much money and I was realizingthat I wasn't really passionate aboutwhat I had just gone to school for for ayear and a half now so I guess I wasreally just looking for like a means ofescape and so I was really just lookingfor something that would bring me somesort of happiness again and give mesomething to be excited about again andI guess that's kind of when I reallystarted to get into YouTube I startedfilming my videos in December and itreally started as just a hobby it's justsomething like I said to be excitedabout again I was finding Fitness it wasjust this whole new journey hi my nameis Jasmine I'm 20 years old I am fromthe Bay Area and I am a 3 dmj athlete ifyou're watching this video I'm assumingyour friends and family then it juststarted to pick up like in a way I wouldhave never imagined and one day Iremember you know it's probably been 3to 4 months of having my YouTube channeland I was starting to pay attention tothe monetization on YouTube and I waslike oh okay like I'm actually makingsome money from thisand I started comparing what I wasmaking from YouTube to my paycheck atwork where I was you know going 30 to 40hours a week and I was like this isreally starting to level out it'sbecoming the same thing and it blew mymind because YouTube was only taking twoto three hours of like joyful commitmentof editing in front of the computer andfilming these videos and just having funand then this other way I was making atthe salon with so much work I mean thefact that it was just adding up andbecoming almost the same I was like okayI can go somewhere with this like thiscan become something so that was it Ibasically just went into my job one daythat my boss is down and told them thatI was going to be pursuing YouTubefull-timeso here we are now 90,000 subscribersand over 4 million views on my YouTubechannel and this is what I get to wakeup and do every single day it's kind ofcrazy when I think about it all becauseI originally started with watching Nickiblocker and I remember coming across herYouTube videos and thinking to myselfwow like this is so cool this girl getsto give these really natural pep talkson her channel getting girls throughrough times and now I look at myself andthat's what I get to do the mostdifficult part of my job these days ismaking sure that I am building arelationship with my audience and makingsure that I'm connecting with them in araw way where they actually feel likethey are getting something from thevideos that they watch you know I don'twant people to just watch my videosbecause they won't watch them you know Iwant them to make sure they're gettingsomething from these videos and thatit's benefiting their lives in some wayoddly enough I can actually stillremember the first time that I saw Jimshark apparel I was at the gym with abunch of friends and one of them had onsome track pants and obviously across iton the leg it said Jim shark and I waslike what is Jim shark and he looked atme and he's like you don't know what Jimshark is I was like I have no idea heseemed so offended he immediately pulledup the Instagram and the web site for meand I was just scrolling through and Ithought it was just the coolest thingever it was apparel for a woman thatactually was really really flatteringthe guys all had this really puttogether stylish look it was the firsttime that I really saw fashion get tiedin with gym apparel and I fell in lovewith it so at the time all I couldafford was to buy myself a couple piecesfrom Jim shark I had gotten my first twotank tops at the LA Fit Expo so you canimagine my surprise when I got an emailfrom the head of sponsorships at Jimshark basically inviting me to become anaffiliate for the brandand basically as an affiliate it startsoff as just receiving Commission you putyour discount code up there and peopleare able to make purchases through therewithin about a month I got a follow-upemail from him saying I have someexciting news for you and I'm like oh mygosh like don't don't get too excitedJasmine this might not be anything andthen he took forever to respond and thenI get another email about an hour latersaying that they wanted to obviouslyinvite me on as an athlete and Iremember calling my best friend and justcrying on the phone not like ugly tearsjust pure happiness like just so muchexcitement because I really neverthought that that was going to bepossible and so to see that happeningright in front of me in an email I wasso emotional over it and for me what wasso great about it was all the doubtsthat I had prior about my youtube andabout this decision I made to createthis new career path for myself reallykind of put it all to rest becausegetting to work with Jim shark and workalongside athletes like Christian guzmánNicki black guitar Steve cook the listjust goes on and on it really validateseverything that I've decided to do thisfar leaving my job pursuing this careerwith YouTube it not only was the rightdecision but it was probably the bestdecision that I have ever made andalthough I haven't been able to go tothe expose yet or travel with them I'mso excited to see what this year willbring and to really just get to growwith the brand I can truly say that thisis the happiest that I have ever beenand I really really believe that my momwould be so proud and so excited for meI didn't knowI was doing and I would I would giveanything to get those years of my lifeback but I can't and it was it wasreally hard timeyou",26,UCqOC1SiA6v994Sx_WR1-xew,Kathryn Mueller,114,29,0,992,"['unsponsored

hey guys and welcome back to my channeland today we're reviewing the new gymshark Geo seamless so I wasn't sureabout reviewing this but I feel like itwas like a moderately hyped up gym sharklaunchI feel like gym shark either has twomoves there either like hype it up somuch that it sells out in three secondsor they have like what even is thatcollection because I didn't see any onewhere again the Geo seamless was attheir Houston pop-up so it was a littlemore hype to the athletes were wearingit I feel like a lot more people postedin this outfit and like the non-stopcollection if that's even the namethat's how unhype it was but anyway Iheard a lot of like kind of mix thingsabout these not that the athletes eversay anything bad reallyI dunno they just were like oh this waslike the camo seamless or it's like theenergy seamless and when I looked atthis collection I was like this is atoned down turbo seamless combined withthe amplifi seamless I think the colorsare pretty cute they're pretty good forfall it's kind of like steel tone blueand this like Ruby Rose tone red theyalso had the black but I didn't get theblack I just got these two colors so Igot the leggings and I got the sportsbra in the long suit top I don't reallyknow if there's anything else I don'tthink I saw any shorts so I read upabout the collection a little bit onlinelike when it launched they kept callingit the return of an iconic look or thatit's like oh the classic gym shark fadedlook and like am I the only one who likedid not think that was a classic gymshark look or like that this is a returnof some kind of faded look like I don'treally understand what they mean by thatlike I would like him to reference acollection of peach it would be nice ifthey would like reference like whichcollection they were talking aboutbecause it really wasn't clear if youever hear a little ruffling happening inmy video it's probably peach playingwith all the clothes on the ground yesanyway it's about further ado let's getstarted so first first we have theseamless leggings like I said this camein the blue color the ruby red and blackthese are fifty five dollars so kind ofon the expensive side I did here mixthings about the sizing I heard thefights up I heard that you could sizedown I posted on my story that I got asize small and someone's like oh my goshyou can give me extra small I was likepeople were saying the size up and downso that means I'm just going to go forthe middle one also I just don't reallytrust people to say the sizewe're down these only came in size extrasmall to large I feel like Jim truckstuff usually comes up to XL so we'llcompute it wouldn't make Excel thefabric itself does feel very similar tothe turbo seamless it's kind of thatlike thick knit material it's superstretchy and it has like a little ribbeddetail so this is what the fabric lookslike it's not shiny but it's also notbrushed or anything and when you stretchit you can kind of see the fibers likestretch out a little bit so that's verysimilar to the turbo seamless and here'sthe waistband it's just kind of a morethick ribbed version of the actuallegging and it's a double thickness thisis a pretty like standard Jim sharkwaistband if you ask me it is seamlessribbed probably will give a decent outof compression it has a ton of littlecontour details everywhere and it hasthis like ombre thing going it's alittle darker at the bottom it kind oftransitions with these little bootiecontour contour designs and then it'smore light at the top but it's a verysubtle ombre honestly I didn't evenreally notice it at first they also havethat little raised like seem like thingin the middle of the bed cheeks to kindof separate them you know no youna buthere I like the booty contour on these Ithink it's like pretty subtleconsidering the rest of the contouringkinda make sense that have a bootycontour and yeah they have all theselittle little detailing dudesso more contouring in the front it'skind of like a quad contour I think mostpeople refer to it as the fabric is anylon polyester blend so yeah and has alittle gusset crotch too of courseso let's turn they do have a nicecompression to the waistband I don'treally see this waistband stretching outbut it's possible it doesn't feel likethe ombre seamless oh definitely have alittle more like give to it and justfeels like it'll hold together I don'tknow why people always feel the need tosay that things run small or run biglike this model is totally fine like Iwould not want to size up it wasawkwardly a little bit tight in the calfregion I do think as I know but usuallyit's okay so it's a little tight cut inlike I don't know the lower leg regionbut I have plenty of space up here so Idon't know like Ihave signs up because or else this wouldbe too big but it is a little bit alittle bit small down there they're alsoa little bit short on me they are kindof above a 7/8 most Jim shark leggingsare full length on me so it's a littlestrange I see why they related these tothe camos it does kind of have thesimilar compression and just kind ofknit feel each it feels almost exactlythe turbo seamless if you have the ultraseamless it's a little more compressivethan that and a little less softdefinitely wouldn't compare these to anenergy seamless the fabric just feelslike very much more stretchy and knit tome I do like the little contourdetailing I think it's actually prettyflattering and I like that it's notsuper in-your-face like it's prettysubtle like when I first saw WhitneySimmons wearing these leggings I did notreally think they even had anything onthem so I do appreciate that they're notdoing anything crazy like the monkeybutt of the turbo seamless I give thesea medium compression possibly mediumhigh but like they're totally not themost compressive gym truck leggings everthis fabric is not going to pill orcollect any lint so that is a plus ofthis kind of fabric after wearing thisfor like a little while fabric is kindof getting a little itchy feeling Idon't know maybe it's just because thisfabric is like kind of that like thelittle knit material but honestly I'mnot loving that feeling right now it's alittle bit edgy I am getting like thetiniest bit of crotch gathering but it'snot a ton so you're just gonna get likea little bit of like Barbie crotchsingle camel in these because they areseamless but you're not gonna get doublecamel some of the seams on the insideare already pulling a little bit for meyou kind of see when I do this the seamspull so I wish that they made theirseams out of like stretch to your fabricbecause the leggings are scratchy butthe seams do resist a little bit I wouldassume these might be pretty cellulitefriendly just because the fabric ispretty thick have a little bit of thatribbing to it and it's got like a mediumto high compression booty scale I've gota medium to high I don't feel like it'ssquishing down my butt I also don't feellike I'm getting total unibit and it hasa little bit of under booty contour soyou'd probably also be pretty good withsweat for these because it has all ofthese little patterns that the sweat wasprobably just gonna blend right intothat so yeah overall I think thatthey're like honestly like pretty goodfor Jim shark wish it was likedidn't have this tightness here and thefabrics are a little itchy for me butit's not awful[Music]we also have the sports brow which was$45 and they advertised it as a lowsupport and I would think with thefabric feeling so compressive and thickthey're probably try to add it advertiseit as a medium support they do haveremovable cut pads so we'll see if we'llbe able to see those from the outsidepet peeve of mine but the fabric doesseem pretty thick so you probably beable to take out the cut pads and notsee any nips they have a nice thickribbed Rob and there's the bra band andthis fabric is the same as the leggingsand basically it has the same kind ofgradient effect at the top of the braand the gym shark logo is embroideredinto the fabric which I love I love whenthey do the logos embroidered into thefabric because or else it just lookslike it just peels off I've had the peeloff before so here are straps in theback I love when jib check does this alittle double strap design I think itlike it's simpler than just a basicbreaks her back it's still technicallyRazorback so it still comes in and thestraps aren't gonna come down oranything okay I'm doing the best I canwith the lighting in here people it'sjust it's dark so so here's this fourthrow good amount of coverage I am wearinga small the little bra band is kind ofcoming up on my boobs a little bit italso has a little widow peak detailthing for this as it does with the longsleeve top but you can barely see itwith the sports bra you cannot see thecut pads at all which is really niceactually I mean this one's a little outof place so you can see it but if it'sin the right place like this one it'sokay I want to give this a mediumsupport I don't know why they're sayinglight support for me light support islike spaghetti strap jiggle city youknowbut this is like honestly fine it'spretty compressive I'm not spilling outof the top or the sides I love when theydo the little double strap details Ithink it's so cute I'm not having anyfit issues with the top I think it'sfitting really well again they have thelittle subtle gym shark logo here andwhat I like about this collection isthat all of the contours and everythingare like built into the fabric so youcan't actually feel any of like thedifference there aren't like differentlevels that you can like feel everythingyeah so I think if you're on board withthis like geometric trend actually notabout sports bra it's pretty good[Music]and lastly we have the long sleeve topthis was $40 so it's cheaper than thesports bra which is a little confusingto me but made of the same material youhave the same gradient effect going onI'm not in love with this thing thatkind of tries to be like a boobseparation that kind of comes up betweenyour boobs because usually doesn'treally fall exactly on your boobs andlike that's not really I don't I justdon't think is really enhancing anythingthe long sleeves have some more of thatdetail maybe a slight gradient to themsome holes of course and the back hasreally more of that contour detailing Icould go into all of the contour detailsbut I don't think anyone really caresand it does help a little like cut outhole in the back that if you are wearingone of the sportswear as you probablysee what Kriss Kross sees so let's tryhere's the long sleeve top so it'sactually pretty good it provides adecent amount of compression so on topof the sports bra I think it gives alittle extra support the sleeves are agood length for me they have littlethumb holes my only thing is like Idon't really like when sleeves do thislike they kind of have like this extraspacer around the wrist it's just like alittle baggy like for something that'ssupposed to look very fitted andeverything I just think that the baggywrist looks a little weird and Idefinitely cannot size down becauseit'll be way too tight here because it'salready pretty compressive you can kindof see the straps up here the topactually is staying put pretty wellbecause it does have this compressiveband at the bottom but as you can tellwe're like very close to the sports braso this isn't like a cover a lot of yourtorso kind of top very cropped you cansee the sports bra through in the back Idon't think it's like the cutest view ofthe sports bra but you can see it maybeif you were a different sports well youjust have your open back which could becute I don't know I can't be the onlyone who's not a huge fan of the longsleeve tops I just think that like itmight be cuter if they had like a tanktop so for people who don't just want towear crop top or sports bra they couldhave like a cute little tank andwhenever they make tank tops they alwaysmake them that go down to like your buttit's like sometimes you just want a tanktop that'll end at the top of it like itbecause then if you're not in the moodto show skin you're not comfortable withthat then like right now like I justdon't really think that they have anygood options for that okay I justchecked and they didn't make any fulllength tops for this collectionanyway that is it okay that is it for myreview I feel like I've been reviewingso much recently that like justreviewing one collection seems likenothing but yeah overall I'm not mad atthis collection I actually like it a lotmore than I did originally the leggingsare honestly feeling pretty good I likethe compression level I feel like theyhave a good amount of waistbandcompression I do like that the patternsubtle honestly these would be cute andjust like a plain legging like withoutany of the pattern but the fact that itis like kind of subtle I like it I alsolike the kind of like jewel tonesituation my only thing is that likethis fabric is kind of feeling a littleitchy after a while and the seams justdidn't feel like super flexible when Iwas squatting so I don't know if thesewould be like leggings that you wouldreally like stretch in or anything ifyou're really sensitive to itchingfabrics probably wouldn't go for thisone because after like a few minutes ofwearing it I do have that kind of itchyfeeling but yeah it's not the worst tubeshark thing I've reviewed this year sothat's great anyway if you guys enjoyedthis video please give it a thumbs upand subscribe to you girl because I justtook two exams and then came home tofill this video so watching TV so thattook a lot of self-control alright thankyou guys so much and I will see you nexttime

hey guys and welcome back to my channelso today I was inspired by some of thelike kind of like unhype Jim sharkcollections if you've seen thembasically what I mean by these are likethe collections that aren't like youknow the energy sea must be super hypedthe ombré see most of super hype thevital camo flawless knit and then JimJeff also comes out with these littlecollections that they kind of like don'tsend to their athletes a lot or theykind of send like they're smallerathletes or they have their athleteskind of like hype them like afterthey've launched so Jim shark definitelydoesn't advertise these launches verymuch it's just kind of weird becausethey're usually like so all about hypingup their products and there's like halfof their collection so they just kind oflike let slide by which is just kind ofweird and in my opinion some of theseare like kind of uglier than the otherones like I personally love they're likecamo and vitals seamless but thesecollections I'm kind of like don't knowwhat they were thinking so I don't meanto like [ __ ] on Jim shark or anythingbut like these collections aredefinitely more questionable I kind oflook at them and I did not feel like Ineeded to go buy them right away theseare also kind of on the cheaper sidelike their camo was $60 and a lot ofthese ones that I'm doing today are like$45 so they must have been like cheaperto make or something so without furtherado let's just start so I have fourdifferent leggings I have the Orileggings I have the like color-blockones I have the do collar ones and Ihave the true texture which I think arereally ugly so excited to try thisso I'm gonna start with the Ori leggingsI got these in a size small and theywere $45 I did not get these on the gymshark sale because I've been to a gymSchreck sale before by then I mean likewas online for a gym strike sale beforeand it's just absolute it's just anabsolute [ __ ] so like nobody super bigfan of it so okay so these are the Orileggings already when I'm holding themup like a lot of light is going throughso I feel like they're a little sheerbut they also have this fun like fuzzokay that came out so they say thatthese are a mid-rise which I don't lovemid-rise I don't think they're veryflattering like their Flex leggings ifthose are a mid-rise and these are alsoa middleI probably won't like them they alsohave this thinner waist beyond at thetop which I feel like would cut into youmore it does it also has a top seam soI'm not so sure and I definitely thinkthat these are more aimed toward likeleisure and not like gym going becauseon their website that says at yourleisureso definitely maybe not a performancelegging they feel definitely likecheaper than most they feel like kind ofslick and texture and like they don'tfeel like they have like the moststretch to them oh I also got the onesin this like pattern print I thought itkind of looks like marble I'm not reallysure but let's just try these and seewe're gonna move the camera down so youcan just see the leggings or else it'sjust you can't see you know if you can'tsee it so these are the Orient leggingsand I wouldn't say them it racks I meanthese go just as high up as any othergym trip like these I have there like aright at my belly button and the waistand actually is like decently flatteringI actually don't feel awful in thesethey just feel a little cheap to get allI'm like this fabric just feels kind oflike I don't know when you get likecheap athletic ladies at the storedoesn't feel great I feel like I havelike major you know but it doesn'treally like give you any putt separationor anything I kind of feel like I'mwearing cargo pants they just have allthese little seams and they just feelvery thick I don't think these would begood for the gym they don't have likethe most stretch to them like I feellike they're really tight on my kneesyeah I thought I would hate these butactually it's not the waistband is likekind of flattering but yeah they're justthey don't wanna Sealy performanceleggings I just don't see like there'sbarely any extra stretch to them thistheme is very weird it kind of goes likehello out to the front I don't know howI feel about that um I don't really haveany camel toe I'm not gonna get anycellulite because of these print so yeahwe're gonna test the squad types in aminute[Music]next we're trying the color-block onesso these are $45they definitely I don't know they justseem kind of unflattering to me I waslooking at like them on some of themodels and they just seemed like reallylike thick and compressive and likedon't do a lot of favors for your butthe fabric nestle feels nicer than theOri leggings it's also kind of that likeslick compression I don't really knowwhat I've compared this fabric to it'snothing like most like mainstreamChimchar collections they all saw thisweird waistband at the top it's kind oflike extra sewn on they have pockets onthe side and yeah I just don't reallythink these are gonna be superflattering they don't really have a lotof things to like accentuate the butt soso these aren't as bad as I thought theydefinitely are stretchier than the Orionleggings they were easier to get on andthey definitely feel like more of aperformance fabricI just am not so sure about a lot ofthis stuff there's no camel toe reallybut they kind of have like I don't knowthere's a lot of seams going on in thefront here that I feel like don't likethe kind of drawing attention that Idon't want um I just don't really feellike it's doing any favors for my butt Ikind of feel like I'm wearing a diapernot really doing any favors here thepockets are nice they're a little smallbut they're pretty cute I feel like thisstyle actually isn't that bad I justfeel like it's not doing me a whole lotof favors it also feels just like reallyweird down here in the crotch I think itjust feels like there's like extramaterial and I'm not loving it yeahthese are definitely I don't know I feellike the OREA leggings made me look alittle better this waistband it'sdefinitely a thicker waistband but Idon't feel like it's helping withanything the top team isn't coming in tome though so these are just like teenybit big so yeah they're just okay[Music]next we have the duo leggings these onesare also $45 so these don't have like awhole lot of like shape or features tothem that make them seem like they'rereally gonna be that flattering the SAPof this fabric is actually super softif these kind of feel like Lululemonaligns I'm not gonna liedefinitely a little bit thicker andheavier but they are honestly reallysoft they're super softokay this is something I don't like so Idon't really mind that it's kind ofasymmetric but they have the scene forthe booty and then they have the seamlike right next to each other so it kindof looks like a mistake I don't knowthey just don't seem like they're gonnado me a lot of favors and I don't know Ido kind of like their logo it's cool onthe bottom it like is the other tone andI'm a little nervous for these becauseon the model on their website the frontseam here is causing like her majorcameltoe and i wonder like why they putthat on there like product images cuzyou can definitely see some camels arethere thank you so okay let's try theseon okay Jim shark um honestly these areso thin and stretchy I literally feellike I'm wearing like ballet tights ifany of you guys used to be dancers theyseriously feel like I'm wearing tightslike I've never felt anything this beenand stretchy I feel like I can doanythingthey are literally yeah yeah these areso soft like I'm thoroughly impressedyou jerk you need to make more thingsout of this fabric because I'm feelingmyself and we're having a good time Imean so the waistband is actuallyseamless at the top and its really doingthings for me in this region I feelsnatched but I have to say I just don'tfeel like this little like asymmetricthing is really helping me out it lookslike this but it's smaller than this butI don't know it's not the cutest I alsofeel like I'm getting a little bit ofcamel toe these are just like reallythin and Ilike it's kind of like accentuating I'mpretty sure this fabric is really sheeras well which is probably why theycovered my butt with this darker onemostly but these leggings really showunderwear lines because I'm super thinso props need to like you know not wearunderwear because these are seamless andyou can still see them but yeah reallyvery impressive these guys like youdon't understand how soft these are likeJim shark good jobalso because these are so thin probablynot gonna be doing any favors in thecellulite region but if you like reallythin leggings I would definitely go forthese these are these are a good onewould love a solid color[Music]okay and last and also probably least wehave the true texturethese are $55 so definitely on thepricey side oh god okay oh my goshI'm sorry these are just so weirdthese are so weird this feels like towellike it's a really weird like softmaterial that I wouldn't expect out ofleggings and I also like I don't knowthis doesn't seem like a very goodperformance material these littletextured bits are just kind of like Idon't know they don't feel very nice thepocket they literally just like cut ahole in it like yeah they lined it onthe side but this is just like they cuta hole like that's kind of cheap likeJim shark you could have done a scene orsomething for $55 really big top beyondhere no looking at the back this lookslike it's just gonna be like a bigmonkey but and also that's not really agood like shape for a but that justfeels kind of like well looks kind oflike pancake to me yes so these leggingsjust have a bunch of different texturesand like this kind of looks like you'rewearing kneepads I don't know I thinkthat these are very very ugly not gonnalie so we're gonna try to no I'm sorryI'm sorry these are just not huge I justfeel like they're kind of squishing mythighs in weird placesand if let me tell you if you havechunky buys all of these seams are gonnado a nice little sausage fest for youokay I know that's not the correct useof sausagefest but that's how I'mfeeling in these leggings I just feellike this onething isn't doing a lot of favors for meI mean my butt ends here and it goesdown here and I just feel like maybe Icould pull it but like yeah I mean allthese textures I mean they just don'tmake me feel very good I feel like theymake my legs look like chunky and likethey like kind of create that appearanceof cellulite almost like this justdoesn't feel like the material thatleggings should be made out ofdefinitely have a tight seam at the topof the waistband could definitely giveyou some muffin top issues I mean justlook at these if you have any thicknesson your thighs it's gonna be a no-goit's gonna be a no-go[Music]okay so that was definitely interestingand so in true texture leggings stillhating them I was pleasantly surprisedwith some of these leggings especiallythose judo leggings that fabric wasliterally like butter but some of theseother ones I just have to ask like whatwere you thinking jump shark like thisisn't a cute look I feel like I amliterally encased in sausage so thankyou guys so much for watching I guesswe'll see you but Jim shark comes outwith next I feel like they haven'tlaunched anything really in like a fewmonths so I'm waiting for those summerlaunches so if you want to make sure tosee all the reviews I'm gonna do thissummer please be sure to subscribe

this is November 21st 2013 and we justgot done with the leg workout hit a newPR today we hit 275 pounds for five setsof five on the squats which is a bigimprovement from the last time in squatswhich was about four days to go fourdays - I only hit 275 for three sets offive and then had to drop the weight sowe got all five sets so we're gonna bumpit up next week and so I got to work outwith my old friendIsuzu Barrett his name's Merritt and weused to work out we were kind of likepartners had that strengthened a Jodykantha I was telling you guys about kindof how I got startedsports performance kind of trainingclasses and such we saw his kind ofworkout and raced against each other andeverything and he's actually inprofessional baseball he's a baseballplayer they have all these differentlevels you know you kind of work yourway up the ladder until you get to themajor leagues always worked his way uphe's 22 years old and he's at the leagueright under the major league so he'slooking to getting picked up within thenext year year and a half or so so it'sawesome for him I know he's gonna do ithe's aone of the hardest-working people I'veever met and it was for work and out ofthe be really pushing you know we weredoing the same way if not he was doingmore weight than me and just kind ofworking out with people that arestronger than you just kind of pushesyou know you want to compete againstthem you wannathere's the same way they're pushing souvr andon way home we're gonna have a nice bigmeal probably some big hard to sourceI'm probably some pasta just because Idon't feel like having rice right nowand then some chicken so it's a pastaand chicken here are calories from theday and that's a guys it's really thenight today it was really a workday soyeah I'm sorry you can't really see toomuch or nowthat's it so how see us tomorrowright now the air is 49 degrees and Iknow that's not cold to a lot of youguys but to us Texans it's like theNorth Pole over here but look who lovesthe weathershe's been outside for like two hoursand this is all she doesyou ready it's kind of kind of weird butit's what she does it's freezing and sheloves it so she just looks at the waterand she just look that's all she does Imean she's not I think she might belooking for a squirrelcuz there's a squirrel that lives inthat tree right there but let's see ifwe can get her to look over here sothat's just there just hanging out yeahare you doing like you out here oh youlike it yeah yeah good girlso just hanging out there guys she lovesit so let her enjoy it while she canit's not too many cold months here inTexas so sure you don't wanna come inyeah one good nah all right guys we'regonna have ourselves some breakfastgonna hit the gym and I was debating I'mjust going on an empty stomach but mystomach is humming growling so I know ifI get hungry mid-workout I'll be alldistracted and I won't have a goodworkout so we're gonna have one scoop ofa strawberry milkshake cellucor proteinso you sponsor discount cook but uh hereit is the reason it is not strawberrycolor it'll it's chocolate color isbecause it had a little bit of chocolateleft over so I just poured it in thiscontainer so it's kind of like achocolate strawberry mix and then Igonna have a little bit of cereal nowthe reason I'm having cereal as opposedto oatmeal or likeI promise holy bread you have to knowyour body yes personally if I haveoatmeal I don't know what it is aboutoatmeal but literally looks like afibrous kind of heavy carb puts me backto sleepit'll I swear it puts me to sleep and ifI try to go to the gym after having abig bowl of oats I can't do it and sowhat I do instead is I have some cerealwhich I would normally have a little bitof fiber one and then some like cinnamontoast crunch but we don't have fiber oneso I'm gonna go ahead and have you knowwhat we'll go some tricks a little bittricks probably I don't know thisserving it's probably about two servingsso only like 240 calories but nothingtoo heavy so I show yes but that's whatI normally do I don't think it's a fiberI just think it's something about youknow I mean you know if honestly likelast time I went on a road trip Iactually stopped and got a bowl ofoatmeal because I knew I wanted to sleepthat wasn't driving so I literally knewthat their oatmeal will be asleep so youknow it's just a little I guess knowingyour body over the years how low thiscerealdropping the goods for he's so muchbetter and they keep its image okaythere my legs are so sore from that legworkout I hit 375 for a 5x5 and like itfelt good at the time and now I'm justso soonI wanted a new gym so I was trying likenew machines new light presses andeverything but for the milk I like touse this almond milk with 30 calories soit's a lowest calorie almond milk Icould find right there and honestly Idon't do a lot of milk and then call mecrazy I don't drink the milk after so Idon't really I feel like it's kinda likeafter so literally all output is likedone like that's it just enough to kindof soak it and then uh that's breakfastguys one big super protein probablyabout 30 grams of protein here because Ikind of do like an over you know like aheaping scoop and then uh some partsI'll see y'all again it's gonna be afull day whole workout commentary andhere we are sipping on some cellucor Cfor my all-time favorite pre-workout seeGuzman is your discount code on cellucorcalm and yeah guys I'm gonna gocommentate over this workout recentlyI've been having my pre workout at thegym as opposed to before the gym sousually I would you know twenty thirtyminutes before my workout I'll go aheadand drink my pre-workout and then hencepre-workout you know but then go to thegym and then start working out but Inoticed that if I drink it 20 minutesbefore then I get to the gym I startwarming up you know maybe you talked tosomeone when you get in there and thenyou start working everything's kind ofalready wearing off so I notice if Iactually drink it when I'm at the gymalready ready to go then it kind oflasts a little bit longer during theworkout you know so just a little couldtry out if you have it but here we aredoing single arm dumbbell rows workingthe weight up on these and today we weregoing for about six to eight reps onthis really focusing on one controllingthe weights and two instead of you knowusing the bicep in the upback to pull the weight really justtrying to engage the lot by whenever youdo a back movement I really try to or Ido a back movement I try to focus onbringing my elbow up so it's almost likeyou're bringing your elbow up throughspace and that's just gonna allow you toengage your lot a little bit more or atleast it does for me so we shouldn't trythat out but bringing the elbow up andalso back at the same time so I'mtalking really quick really fast I'mgetting kind of weighted but yeah on thedumbbell rows instead of just flinchstraight up you know yanking thedumbbell up you want to pull you want tostart with the dumbbell a little bit infront of you as you can all right lookhere I kind of put the dumbbell in frontof me a little bit and then I'm gonnapull it up and back at the same time andthat's just gonna help get it a littlebit more natural movement to engage thelatso up and back and yeah one of my bigpriorities this lean bulk is to bringout my lats and add overall lean bodymass you know next time I step on stageI definitely want to be over 160 meaningI have to put on about a good 10 poundsof muscle so we're looking at a niceduration of the bulk keeping it decentyou know I'm weighing in at like 164 to166 between 150-160 for 166 so oninitially you know the first coupleweeks after contest prep I gave myself alittle bit of a break you know kind oflet myself eat a little bit and that'sokay I needed that break and now we'regonna really start buckling down kind ofslowing down the big weight gain whichfor the last two week or we can havefour so it's really been about the samemaybe slight increment so we're goodthe I feel like I'm just mentally readyto you know start tracking everythingget more accurate with it and aim forabout one to two pounds per month andcheck out the stringer this tank-topguys this is a brand new gym shark tanktop it is black with a graphite sharkthis is their Titan design but a reallyreally cool tank top they came out tonsof new stuff and also it matches the newtrack suit like perfectly so it's realcool outfit really sleek and a lot ofyou guys asked me what shoes I wear soif you notice here they kind of looklike I don't know if in all thecountries you guys have vans VA and sbut they kind of look like vans butthese are actually Aldo and that spelledaldo their aldo shoes they're actuallyreally cheap they're like $20 or so andI see I kind of think that they goreally good with the gym sharp look youknow if you're obviously you don't wantto be wearing these shoes if you'regoing like you know if you're going doit to do agility work performance workor squats or anything like that but um Ilike them just from you know like mypull or push workout so I'm not reallydepending on my shoes but you notice onmy squat workout so I'll use my Adipowers or my and then on my leg workoutit's not that they're different but Iuse my a deep hours my New Balanceminimus and you know if you're doinglike a like what I'm doing here a singlearm pull down it really doesn't matterwhat kind of shoes you have on so therealdo shoes I wear and they're currentlydress shoe sizing so if you guys canorder them I'm usually 10 and a half or11 but the nine and a half to ten spitme perfectly so it's kind of like onesize down from a running shoe size sothat is that that's really gonnaconclude this episode guys have a lot ofnew stuff coming for you soon I'mworking on some good projects so I'll besure to keep you all informed on thatand yeah I did a couple more exercisesI've been noticing that I've been doinga lot of high-volume so I've honestlybeen doing like seven or eight exercisesper workout as opposed to five or sixbut that's that and I hope you enjoyedthe video be sure to subscribe and emailme a Christian use about Fitness

hey guys and welcome back to my channelso surprise surprise we have another Jimshark video so Jim shark obviously isjust pumping out the launches thissummerlast week they launched the turbotcollection which is this very boldcollection really bold color blockingjust a lot going on I personally boughtthese now because I liked them butbecause I thought they were like wereally like I kind of out they'redefinitely different than what Jim sharknormally does I'm not sure these are myfavorite collection from Jim shark atleast from my first impressions butwe're gonna give them a solid chance andsee if they maybe surprised me I got theseamless leggings and the sports bra tomatch and then I got the croppedleggings and the long sleeve to matchthis one so we have four differentthings to review without further adolet's start reviewing so I think weshould just start reviewing the seamlessleggings I feel like this is like thebig-ticket item of this collection theseare the turbo seamless leggings inbrick-red and they have some very uniquedetailing so first of all this littlelike seam detailing on the top at leaston the back part it honestly looks likeI go rip in the fabric like I'm notreally sure how much I like that but itis seamless and they have this like kindof like neared Jim shark logo it's likeonce I said Jim shark one side says likecur mag whatever Jim shark it'sbackwards not good at saying backwardsthe fabric definitely feels like aperformance material it's not caught meand not brushed but it's also not likesuper slick it has like an interestingtexture to it it's not quite a marledfabric but when you pull it itdefinitely lightens up feel like whenyou squat even if they are actuallysquat proof I feel like you're gonna seejust like some weird light coloring andit's just going to look like it's year Idon't know and they have a lighter colorkind of going down the legs and a littlecolor black paneling and then they havethis little heart monkey bat detailingwhich personally I think is a littlemuch I mean it's really like Hello hereis my bed yeah it also has a seamlessribbed waistband so the sports bra isthe seamless sports bra also inbrick-red it was $40 so definitelyexpensive for a sports bra it'sadvertised to be a medium support and itclaims to be a racerback but it'sactually not a racerback it just goeslike regular tank back style Reese yourbacks are like what I'm wearing rightnow when it goes like the straps meet inthe back it does have aflights coupe detailing in the back itis very high neck which I like because Ipersonally like to just wear sportsright to the gym instead of like the topand everything so I like a little morecoverage in the sports borough regionjust because then it feels like you'rewearing more of a crop top not just asports bra the logo again is embroideredinto the fabric and has that like neardetailing I do think it is moreluxurious when ship shark embroiders thelogo into the fabric just because I feellike they're little print on vinyls thatthey sometimes do they can peel offafter a few washes and they just looklike a little bit cheap so yeah that isthe first of the collection so let's goahead and try everything on doing alittle boyfriend reacts to my ship sharkoutfit clarify I'm not saying she looksbad it's the out okay okay so here arethe leggings and I have to say when apurchase first trying them on thematerial is very thick and stretchy itdefinitely has a lot of compression toit so if you like really compressiveleggings these are actually not bad thewaistband is okay my only thing is thatI really had to like pull it up in theback to get this line to be in a decentspot around my butt and because of thatI'm getting a lot of camel toe and likea lot of just like gathering around thecrotch The Gathering isn't like extremebut I do feel like when I stand togetherthere's definitely a lot of likeattention drawn there yeah I just feltlike I couldn't really pull it up allthe way like up to my butt very much itwas a kind of a struggle this is mynormal size small I don't know the colorblack detailing is very bold and Iactually think that it's kind of coolit's actually kind of unique have afabric kind of like thins out and iskind of like basically it's a ribbedmaterial so when you put it on it's notas opaque red as well as when you don'thave it on like this waistband red is athicker like more dense red than therest of the liking I do you think it'skind of like a unique design on thefront at least I don't think this bootycircle thing is like that flattering Ithat they could have either just donethe bottom one or the top one they're alittle bit less than a full-length on meand I'm five nine teams feel slightlytight on the inside they definitely feellike I got some stretching in here Ithink that they would be prettycellulite friendly just because they'reso thick and super ribbed and the fabricjust has so much compression I doactually think that they'd be prettycellulite friendly so that is it on theleggings[Music]okay so here's the sports graphI definitely like the neckline I thinkthat the high neckline is veryflattering it has the little scoopedback as well and the straps woulddefinitely not fall down at all in thesports bra because they do go backpretty far in kind of like a Razorbackbut not quite it feels actually probablyyeah like a medium support it does havea lot of coverage but I just feel likeit's not like quite high support youknow the pads are actually pretty goodin this sports bra I can't see the padsthis fabric is just so thick andcompressive that I feel like it actuallymakes for a pretty good sports bra myonly thing is because of the high necksometimes it can have weird fit issueslike I'm getting a lot of gaping aroundhere is part just doesn't sit on yourbody very nicely yeah I just don't lovethat this is my normal size small Idon't think I could have gone for anextra small if I got a medium this issuewould be even worse so definitely not inlove with the fit of that but everythingelse the sports bra is pretty true tosize again it has some color-blockdetailing this part matches thewaistband of the leggings and this partmatches like most of the body of theleggings but I don't actually have a lotof side boob spillage which is goodsometimes with high neck bras you canget side boob now we are on to the caprileggings so these leggings are notseamless and to be honest taking themout of the bag I wasn't very impressedwith these they're made of a very thinkind of like flimsy like that kind ofslick athletic material that feels likekind of like a cheap pair of like Nikeleggings which I'm not saying Nike likethese are bad but like I feel like I'vejust had like some really like lowquality Nike leggings in the past andthis waistband it's pretty awful um itis a nice thick cheap elastic waistbandlike these things are really cheap likethis kind of thick elastic this is notgoing to do you any favors for yourwaist it's either gonna be too tight orit's gonna cut into you and give you amuffin top so I'm really not lookingforward to that the inside of it alsohas one of those little slick detailswhich means that they probably don'tstay up very well on their own if theyuse a more expensive like stylewaistband I don't think they would haveneed this little like elastic stickythingand on the website it says it's a ribbedwaistband in what world is this a ribbedwaistband this is just a little piece ofelastic there is no ribbing going on inthis waistband they also have like somesuper shiny reflective detailing whichjust feels like I don't know this iskind of giving me like Wonder Womanvibes but like knockoff Wonder Womanbutts they also have the shiny materialgoing in the front they have the sameJim shark and like reflection thinggoing on and they have another one ofthose seams right under the butt whichlike I don't think those really do muchfor your but I feel like this is kind ofgonna like flatten it a bit and to matchI got the turbo long-sleeve crop top thelong stiff crop top is $35 so it'sactually cheaper than the sports breaththere's a lot of the same color blackdetailing there's just like a lot goingon with this again like me some kind offeel like superhero vibes but like notin my favorite way very similardetailing to the legging it has kind oflike little wrist cuff detailing withthumb holes which I love a nice thumbhole and I know I don't know but like Idon't feel like these really go togetherthe model was wearing the long sleevecrop top and the turbo cropped leggingsand you just don't feel like they reallygo because this fabric is so shiny andlike reflective and this is very matteyeah then seamless so okay we're gonnatry this on and see how it goes ifsomeone gave me these leggings I wouldnot expect them to cost more than like$10 these feel just so cheap like Ireally really don't enjoy this I justfeel like the fabric is super thin andlike not I don't know not high qualitysince this fabric is so thin it doesn'treally make sense to me why the waistand it's like so thick and compressivewaistband is just like a straight-uppiece of elastic like I'm sorry I justthat's not okay if you can see thislittle front region it honestly kind oflooks like it's like skewed a little bitit's actually not like this line goesthis way and then it kind of like warpsa little bit it also has like a thick Idon't know seam going on here looks likeI wore the leggings backwards butthey're not backwards not for me thisshiny reflective thing I feel like I amon duty at the crosswalk you know tryingto prevent kids from getting hit bythings because I'm so reflective so Idon't love thisthing I feel like it can maybe look youin a different sense but just looking atit right now I just like here's the buttdetailing I do have to say at least thisgoes above the butt so it's moreflattering than if it was cutting off mybutt in the middle so good for YouTubecheck for that part I don't like thislittle seam right here it makes me looklike I'm wearing shorts in addition tolike my leggings I just don't think thisis necessary I don't think it's veryflattering um I feel like it kind ofcuts off my butt in a way so no that'sall I really gonna say about these Ijust think that this is probably likeone of the worst pair of gym shirtleggings I've tried on in a while theseamless leggings were even though Ididn't love them much better than thisthis front seam also could be leavingyou at risk for some camel toe thiswaistband is so tight also like I feellike it's suffocating me and like Ithink I'm like already getting marksfrom it being like it's uptight alsothis is the length it hits right belowthe knee I prefer my cropped leggings togo to about with my calf so these kindof make me feel like I don't know theseare the kind of cropped leggings I worewhen I was like in sixth grade um thisis not my fav look[Music]so here we are with the long sleep crapshop I put it on over the sports brajust to see if you could see thesportswear underneath it personallydoesn't make a lot of sense to me tomake a sports bar really high neck andnot have the crop top like able to coverit I do have to say it does cover thesports bra pretty well there's a decentamount of length under my boobs probablyabout two inches it's actually stayingdown really well this has a very snugfit and this little waist beyond a kindof thing right here or like bra band isvery snug and staying on very well thewrist cuffs they aren't too tight theyhave a sila decent amount of room for meI don't know if you like this littlelike kind of extra fabric look or not itdoes have little thumb holes which Ilike and yeah the fabric is just exactlythe same as the seamless leggings and soit doesn't really go with the croppedleggings it definitely goes more withthe seamless leggings I think for methat all of this little color-blockdetailing is just too superhero vibesfor me for like a daily basis it's notmy favorite I think that the back cutoutis really cute it also gives you alittle like I don't know a little morebreathability because this is a verythick dense fabric and honestly likethis isn't for summer I don't know whythey launched this collection in thesummer it's a very thick in winter IIdefinitely will keep you warm so if youlike really thick wintery fabrics forthe summer this could be for you I dohave to say that this gym truck it's notvery legible so unless you know thatthis is Jim shark you're not going toreally be able to read that and be likeoh I can tell what that isI truly do feel like Wonder Woman orsomething right now maybe a littleCaptain Marvel action so yeah that is itfor the review um overall I wouldn'trecommend any of these pieces I justdon't think this is Jim sharks likeshining collection of the summer I thinkthey're coming out with their ultraseamless line soon which I'm definitelyexcited to try because those are a lotof really cool colors and it's not soin-your-face and like weird is this butif this is your vibe go for it it's alsojust keep in mind very hot for thesummer so I'm not sure I would get itright now but yeah those are my honestopinions let me know if you guys likethese videos down below if you got thisfar in the video make sure to subscribeand turn on the notification bellbecause I am posting all the time

what is up guysI'm currently weighing 90 kilos I meanthis varies a little bit earlier Iweighed myself I was eighty nine pointsix but so far I've lost about fivekilos in the last three weeks so mydiets been going well so today I'm doingmy hypertrophy shoulders and backworkout you can see I'm wearing my gymshot fit but it's up and I'm wearing thetapered bottoms as well matching colorsyeah I'm starting off with the low rowI'm going for higher reps you can seeit's got 70 kilos on each side and Itypically typically go for 10 to 15 repsI think I looked all over this one andthen 10 and 10 presets I'm not really afan of this machine I usually like tofinish first and there were othermachines were back now this machine itstarts off low and then it make it comeshigher as you pull it back so it worksin a weird wave it will do for the areasthat I'm trying to work I guess like thelats just some of the traps obviouslybuilt the rear delts and the biceps butmainly as I'm doing it for the latswe are going for that was the second setof the descent to my first shoulderexercise I'm doing dumbbell shoulderpress my strength has gone off in thisexercise I mean you can play Aikido Itry and get Rufus between six and twelvereps for this exercise and I think I'vegot six for the first set there are afew things I'm trying to do whenever Ido this exercise like apart from liftingthe weights up keeping my back flatagainst the seat because I don't want toarch it too much that's like a naturalnatural thing that happens when you dothis exercise you want a hardshipbecause according to trying to find aneasy way to lift the way up so keepingyour back flat against the bench isimportant and making sure that both armscome up at the same time this is thesecond time I'm using thirty kilos againand I was trying really hard to makesure both arms came up at the same timeI think my left one is to go updown the control but force has to thisexercise here on the third line Idropped down the weight because I didfive on a second set I did thirty kilosfor the third set and I got six I thinkit wasn't moving as quickly as I wantedit to see them for the fourth one Idropped down to 28 kilos and I gotanother six yeah this this shirt itdoesn't ride up or move around oranything it's really fitted and itwasn't that how I actually wearing itwasn't based on tire and obviously thegym is a upon but good alright from asecond back exercise I'm doing the latpull-downs over this machine because I'mgoing for higher reps so I really liketo focus on technique keeping the chestup shoulders back really trying tosqueeze my shoulder blades together atthe bottom and holding that contractionat the bottom for for a little while Idon't just want to come all the way downand go back upso you want to hold it at the bombposition I have my second at theshoulder exercise I do these left sidelateral raiseshere I'm using 16 kilos this is mysecond set the first set I filmed by itwas completely out of focus so I had tore-film it my second set so theimportant thing with this exercise is tomake sure that the elbows are high notthe hands so it's all going elbows upand you want the hands to be twisted sothe little finger should be the highestpoint of the hand so you can see thattrying to tilt the weights so that thelittle beside where the little finger isis higher than the side where the thumbis you can see is some sign to strugglethis way at this point so instead ofjust going through with worsening form Idecided to take a few seconds resttrying to get qualityyeaha few second dress and keep on going Ithink I've got three sets of 15 withthis way so you know they're not thestrictest the reps in the world but Itry and keep them as strict as I canokay this is the readout exercise Ithink they're called scarecrows or reardelt cable flyes so holding a cable fromopposite sides and then you want to usethe elbows to try and bring yourshoulders back so it's all about gainingthe elbows and shoulders back that thefirst set this is the first set theweight that I used it says seven pointfive kilos on each side and I think itwas a bit heavy for me after doing thoselat pull-downs so you see I'm strugglinga bit and the arms should be quitestraight with a slight bend in the elbowbut you can see I'm bending quite a bitit wasn't as easy as I would have likedso I dropped the weight down for thesecond or third sets and the first one Igot ten they all got 12 12 10 or 12 thesecond and third ones so you see withthe lighter weight that performs muchbetter and I mean all the way backsqueezing at the back trying to reallyfocus on using the rear delts and therhomboids as well the inner upper backtry not to use the arms you can see I'musing a little bit momentum at the endat the certain as it gets harder tryingnot to trying to keep its tricks keepthat isolation after that I do facepulls these are good for I find the Ifind I fill them in the traps actuallythey're good for the rotator cuff aswellso I go to before the high reps tank 15reps I think this is 40 kilos on theweight stack so trying to get my handshigh elbows backso elbows and shoulders back squeezingthe contraction at the back I likesaying back Don I yes the threes it's afifteen tryna keep good form and then tofinish off I like to some close gripbench press for triceps because I thinktriceps there's something I need to workon and I didn't do that much volume fortriceps in my in this shoulders and backworkout so I decided to do this high ripbus with bench presses here I'm doing 60kilos I try to get at least 15 reps orhail or 20 for this oneyou can see that I'm using the suicidegrip for the thumbs over the group Iwouldn't recommend this for the normalbenchpress block the close grip benchpress because of the arm and elbow elbowposition is much lower down I think ismuch safer I actually use it for theoverhead press for the military presssee I just did two sets of these thefirst one I got 20 the second one I haveabout 15 by that point I was reallyfeeling the pump been a bit fatigued asI'm dying at the moment I get fatiguedmuch quicker than I would do if I waseating at maintenance or if I was eatingat a surplus gaining weight so I'm justdoing the best I canthese reps with toughmy elbows were coming a bit too far outthe side again I just wanted to get this15here's some poses that I thought I woulddo with the gym shot fit hooded top andthe tapered bottoms in gray in graphitejust to give you guys an idea of how itlooks together and also to show like abit of a progress update might be thatmoment so I'm 183 centimeters so sixfoot tall currently 90 kilos not reallysure where that is in pounds so I'm notthat lean at the moment but I have lost5 kilos over the last few weeks like Isaid I am leaning

hey what's up guys right here yourfriends all I really want to talk aboutsomething that is going on around likeas you can tell in the description ofthe video I say I'm not really big gameshark fan so I find out that in eBay andAmazon is going around like fake Chinesecopies of ginger clothing so I'm notsaying it's bad buying whatever Iunderstand if you are like myself thatyou all are always tracking your budgetand you are always trying to save somemoney just to stay motivated and keep itgoing and keep it hard you know theytrying to be in the fitness thing it'sreally hard you always have to betracking for your food for thesupplements for your clothing so you arelike me I like to look good I like torun nice clothing so but right now it'sgoing around the stuff that is gettingfake like the Chinese fake copies thething is they are much cheaper our theyare like different materials the onlything I want to where the people is thatdon't let them to scam you so you payfor something and respecting that sayauthentic item and that it then is notand you think games are sucks gym shallhave really really nice quality theyhave really nice materials like what Iam wearing right now really love it andI understand it's the price is not cheapbut it's not super expensive we're nottalking about weaboo ton or somethinglike that but the thing is I want to letyou know that if you paying forsomething I want you to know what you'regonna get actually in eBay I find outthat you can find like authenticproducts for somebody that buy them anddon't want it anymore whatever you canfind a cheaper yeah it is the case but Iwant you to know I want you to find outwhat is authentic what is not and justdon't get the scamother day I place a bid for a elementt-shirt and I just I know it was fromChina I say this is fake but let's seehow he how it looks I can maybe use itfor work and I place my before my maxwas like $10 and at the end at the endsomebody pay thirty seven dollars for ashirt for a fake t-shirt like elementt-shirt from huge shark a fake one ifyou go to the page like talking aboutdollars right here in Americayou pay $31 for the original itemsomebody pay 37 so I'm pretty sure thisperson is gonna get really mad when hereceives item the only thing is you haveto find out the way to say you have tofind out a way to get what you can andif you are buying something that youshould know there is not authentic andyou know what you buy you know you getwhat you were what you pay forfor example Jim shark I've been savingthis chair for daysI want to use it but Jim shark alwayscome in this kind of bad okay they mustcarry you you can also see the the sharkthey sign right there always come likethis in this kind of paper they use itfor storage wherever I like idea becauseyou don't you got some dirty stuff onyou I really recommend to wash it beforeyou use it but I don't do it alwaysanyway but you know it's veryrecommended so when you get a juiceafter almost pretty much all the timecomes with sign right here if you seeand comes with a with a tack right thereso when you open ityou open a fake one you can really seethe difference of the material okay thisis a large I love it and I just open itokay so this is what you get thatthey're really nice sign right heresomebody paid for something like this$37 this kind of element t-shirt and Ipaid like 31 so plus plus a shipping andI can give you a couple tips about it atthe end so this is what you get okaynow talking about this one it's prettyold I also have to buy it but I'mtalking about this because I have to buythem this this is one the kind of thefake copies okay look at it this is thered a Titan stringer blah blah blahlooks really good yes but if you see theshark doesn't have the tail on top okayanother tail with it and if you watchthe original one oh you the original onethat I received it a couple days so Ididn't say they made the paper I justthink at all but I haven't used it yetas you can tell and this one for thestory comes with attack a game shut upwith a sign me a shiny sign okay comewith the tire and with the little tagright here that says game shark okayseries large with the little logo andeverything so if you can see in thedifference of the fake one this one theyyou cannot even see the back of theshark because it's bigger okayif you see the fake onethe shark is a little bigger so theyhave to round it all the way in the backanother point they why back okayyou see this why it's pretty big for astringer because in the original thedesign really helps to to promote yourphysique you can really show it out butI have couple guys in the gym tell meare you looking big and say it's no bigis the clothes I'm trying to get bigalso but I am not that big as you cantell but the clothes make you look likeyou are getting huge and that's why Ilove this kind of this kind of teamworkbecause I feel free with the movement Idon't use it when I do like because Idon't move in my arms but pretty muchwhen I am doing chest shoulders back Ilove it I just love it and the thing isyou can see the white back in this oneit's a little bigger you can see it'slike where you can tell like two inchessomething like that and in the fake oneyou can see it is like three inches likeone inch or wider so and you can seethis is pretty old but you can see theeven the favorite you you of course youcannot touch about you see it thisfabric is shiny okay is you can tell youknow all the cut around here andeverything it's much different as thisone then the one that looks pretty muchlike it is the other one with a with around sign okay this is the fake one tooand I want to show you something alsookay this one you see really nice thethe white back is pretty wide and youknow and the sign is round andeverything so and they promote this oneas a golf Jean ordinal color Jim chardblah blah blah the stringer because ifyou see looksthis is the color of the most officialgirls gym stringer they sail around andthe other one this is also the originalyou can see the back solo the smaller sohelps your back looks like more widerlike they'd be tapering when you aredoing it looks a lot better and the signis pretty much the same if you see thesign right here and you see the signright there it's pretty much the sameand also in the fake one you can see thetag just come a little thing don't comeanymore so what I want to talk aboutthis firstlike I said the beginning is not badthat you buy some fake stuff becauseeverybody we wish to have a big budgetand just buy whatever we like but thething is I want you to know that you'regonna get what you pay for and don't Ihave nothing to do with gym shirt I justlove the brand I really like it thematerial is amazing you know make youlook very good this is also is in shockto have I'm going the pants so that'sone thing and another one you know ifyou are like me you are fan from illungaBay Matt algos jet side all thoseathletesthat are

alwaysfold them or whatever sponge them up alittle bit that could look cuteokay so the one thing i will say is theamazons arereally big um i still think they lookgood though but they're just kind ofbunchy in the front and you can see howfar i can pull the waistband off of meit's kind ofnuts but they're comfortable they justaren'tquite as great but a huge savings soconsider themall right next

like thatsame littlesee the little seam the god it's so hardto showthat little crease for a separation inthe back which i lovethey feel a little looser these arei think these are gosh they don't sayanythingi think these aren't extra small but themarkings arethe same see the booty contourand the leg dots and then hereare gymshark onessee like come on i have high hopes fortheseagain i haven't tried any of the amazonones on yet so we're allbinding out together how exciting um butthese would be amazingall right on to the next theseare so close like these are reallyreally good dupesum they again have a lot of fabricin the waist area for me but i thinkthey're almostexactly the same in every other way soum if you have different proportionsthan me they might be likea dead-on dupe for a lot lesssometimes we hold on to let go[Music]all right next we have some of myfavoriteleggings which are the the alphaleteum arrow leggings which i did a try onforum they have all those cool detailingson the legs they look kind of terribleand they're not on butthey are really some of my favorites andthen theseamazon ones that are the closest thing ican findto the arrows they're not dead on butthey're pretty good a lot ofcontouring and detailingthey feel about the same fabric liketexture and quality maybemaybe slightly less amazing they'rethinner which could be a good thingin warm weather and let's see the widthis just about the same and thelength is also just about the samebut the alpha leaves are super long likealways very longall right now i really love thealphalete leggings just something aboutthat fabric blend is sonice so the amazon ones againare just kind of loose and i think alittle bunchylike in the front which is not whereanybody wants it but i do think thecontouring is pretty cooland they give the same effect for againlike a pretty huge savingsnow here's another like incredible dupeand the cool thing aboutthis set is umthese are the gymshark ombre leggingsseeand they're amazing they don't make themanymore so if you buy them you have tobuy themum on poshmark or mercari which i didlike i don't know six times but they'reso expensive because everybody lovesthem you can't get them sothey're like 80 to 100 bucks new if youcan find a new pair in your sizeum they're beautiful they're just soprettylike i have them in coral and pink andgray but this is thepurple into gray andum that was the color that the amazonones match so wellso again super high hopes this would belike the biggestwin i thinkand here are the amazon oneshow crazy is that i feel like thereshould be some kind oftrademark suit i don't know maybe that'smy lawyer hattalking um yeah i feel like somebodyshould get suedover this level of copying but maybeit's not worth it the shape seems alittle strangebut god i want these to be good solet's see what we think you can pairthemlike this okayall right dude i really have to checkwhat's what hang onyeah okay so here they're just aboutwellthe gym sharks are actually a littlewider interestingand a little longer so maybe i'm in luckwith the sizing on the amazon ones whichi thinkas a rule look like they're going to betoo big all right so the thing about thegym shark ombresis that the booty contour is likehalfway down your thighthat's well advertised about thesetights everybody talked about it whenthey came out and they still talk aboutitbut you know they're still cute i thinkso the amazon ones actually fixed thatproblemthe booty contour is better but a lot ofbunchiness in the front again you cansee when i kind of walkum that there's just a lot right thereother than that i think they're reallyreally close and in some ways betterlike i saidall right next up we have the gym sharkwhat are these calledum energy plus seamlessthat i really like i don't wear theseenough i should wear these moreum they're pretty they have this like idon't know what would you call thisalmost crochet effect and they're likeholes they look really cute on they'rekind of thick and warmbut they look really cute um and then itried to do the same colors andeverything but they didn't have thatcolor so thisis the amazon pair similar feelingcheck it out lots of cute holesokay and they're kind of strangelybow-leggedbut whatever they could be great so thegym shark onesare okay gymshark's 55and the amazon are 1680 whatplease let these be great so 55 versus1680god if you have prime like you're set ireally hope these are great um they'rejust about the same widthand they feel similar in the fabric gymshark charlie sturdiergym sharks a lot longer but i thinkthese ones are long on me so maybethat'sa plus um yeah they just feel kind ofslightly less amazing fabric the seamsare yeah pretty good like a lot ofstitches per inch which is what you lookatwhen you're buying um lower qualitystuff just to make sure thestitching isn't terrible so it's goingto fall apart but these look pretty wellmadefingers crossedokay so the gym sharks i should saythere is a little runin the crotch area of my gym sharks sothat speaks to the quality of thosewhich is important the amazon ones likewhen i'm looking at thevideo here i think they look pretty goodthey didn't feel great onthey just felt kind of i don't know likenotgreat quality but i think the effect ispretty closeloose in the waistband again lots ofroom to hike them upbut they just didn't like hold youenough and i'm somebody who hatescompression so that's pretty rare for meto say thati also thought they were prettysee-through butyou make the call[Music]now a funny thing happened to me when idid uma legging try on a couple of videos agobecause iwore the bombshell ones and i was likethese ones i hate and then i looked atthem and i was like wait they lookpretty goodso now i love these that's the thing sothese are um the bombshell leggings withthe socksiconic um and they are80 let me seethey're 86 dollars um and these are theamazon dupessame kind of feel these go up to thethigh so it's gonna look a littledifferent but bonjour makes that styletooand these are like dirt cheap let's see19.80come on um they feel more seamlessum that seamless material than thebombshell ones which are like brushedcottonbut similar with let's see the lengthsame length so i am hopeful let's checkit outand see what we get with these nowthese are the ones i think i'm gonnakeep i think these ones look really cuteonand they feel good and they you knowthey're like shorter in the waist on mewhichi think is what i need because whenthey're too biglike and the waist is really high theni'm kind of drowning buti thought these fit pretty well theyfelt great i think they look cutethey're different and again like so muchless expensive than the bombshellsso love thesenow for my favorite booty scrunchleggings you guys know thisit's the cls umtextured leggings so the closest i couldfind on amazon were thesethat are also textured and definitelyhavea scrunch but like they just looksomething like huge um i'm a littlenervousabout these yeah a lot widerumabout the same length but like same viberight with the texture and thescrunching it's just likei have you know a medium buttand it's like more athletic it's not oneof those giantbooties so these leggings have to belike just right on me and usually thatmeans prettysmall so i'm a worried person but wewill againbe optimistic until we find it otherwiseso again when i'm looking at the tape ithink these look okayi think the sheen is kind of cool but ifelt like i was wearing my mom'spants like they just felt so looseand with a booty scrunch for me becauseyou know i'm not like super well endowedi need it to kind of grab me so theseare going backbut if you are more blessed than me theymight look amazing onactually the quality was great and ithink the color is so pretty and i lovethe effect when i turn around like howthe light bounces off of themso they are interesting just not greaton me[Music]now i've said a bunch of times so myfavorite leggingsof all are the nbgtns the navigationsso i try to find something to do thosebuti mean nothing like those so i tried sothese are great these are pretty they'rea little bit different than the otherones that icalled gymshark vital seamless dupesthey do have the booty contour that'skind of tone on tonemuch like the navigation ones do umyeah the navigation material is whatmakes them so amazingand they retailed for i think like 45bucksso the um amazon ones are 26.99 which isnot really enough for me but you justyou can't get the navigation once that'sthe problemso let's try them and see i'll staypositiveit's kind of unfair to compare anythingto navigation butbecause they're so impossible to get iwanted to try and i think these arepretty good dupei think they look nice the color ispretty closeit's just that navigation fabric is sospecial and honestlyi've paid like two to three x the retailprice of the navigations becausei normally have to buy them aftermarketsoum the dupes are cool though they'redefinitely worthlooking at and i just love the color andthey have these in a million colorsso check them out[Music]thank you guys for watching

I can't lie and say I set out with aplan to be where I am now that Ibelieved in myself and made it a realityI didn't I don't think I had a vision Ithink my success came from making a lotof the wrong decisions I got to a placein my life where I didn't feel goodabout how I looked or felt so I forcedmyself to make a change a change whichgave me the opportunity to reach out tothousands of other women around theworld a change which saw me completelyturning my life around a change whichled me to becoming the first-ever femalegym track athlete this is where myvision was bornyouyouyouI grew up in a small town outside of SanAntonio Texas um singing it was a smallcountry town and as soon as I graduatedI ran off to San Antonio itself becauseit was a bigger city I just wanted toget away from the small-town vibe and Ididn't know anyone or anything when Iwent out there so I ended up I wasconvinced to go to Community Collegebecause it was less expensive and I gota job waiting tables but I just did notenjoy Community College life I didn'treally enjoy the atmosphere the attitudeof the people it was very I just Ididn't love it I didn't want to be thereso I stopped going and so all I did waswait tables and I went with five or sixdollars my bank account at a time andI'd put that my gas tank just to make itto work and I was literally just workingto live just to exist I had no goals nosavings account no aspirations and Iended up just turning to alcohol andgoing out every night to get over myfrustrations and so my friends and Iwould just go out every night of theweekI was always hungover always miserableand that's all I did that was my thatwas my outlet alcohols a depressant so Imean I was obviously just very down onmyself and that continued for years ofmy life from 18 this to 22 I I justdidn't even I didn't know what I wasdoing and I would I would give anythingto get those years of my life back but Ican't and it was it was really hard timethere was a point where I woke up and Ilooked at myself in the mirror and I wasso tired of feeling like crap in themorning I I never felt awake or healthyor alive and I didn't like what I sawwhen I looked in the mirror and I had Ihad tried running and things like thatpreviously I've gotten a gym membershipand never actually consistently went soI always dropped it and I had neveractually done anything in high school ormiddle school or any of my youngerschooling athletic I never did a sportor anything marching band was my PEcredit in high school so this was thefirst time that I decided I was gonna gotry to lift weights and I had just seensome stuff online with some other kindof fitness models it wasn't as big of athing in 2012 but I had seen some otherfitness models that said they liftedheavy weights and got the physique theywanted and I liked how they looked so Igot a gym membership at this place downthe road and it was essentially like theRetirement Center of San Antonio becausethere was no one in my gym under like 60years old so I went by myself everysingle day to the gym and startedlifting weight and it was very addictingto me because I saw results quitequickly and it was fun because it wasn'tjust going and running mindlessly on atreadmill for hours it was like I got todo different things and exercisingdifferent body parts and it was just itwas really fun to me and it became myoutlet and I replaced alcohol withlifting weights it was difficult becausenone of my friends were into that theywere still going out they were stilldrinking so I would literally go to workI'd get off at 11:30 p.m. and I would goto the gym after that and I would justgo work out while all my friends wentout so it's kind of hard I had toessentially lose my friends to to getthis lifestyle and it was very lonely soI ended up turning to social medias tokind of find some support because Iwasn't getting that from my friends andthe people I was around I started atumblr account whichBlagh type platform and I also startedposting my progress pictures of thingson Instagram which wasn't as popularthan it wasn't a thing to really have afits Instagram so my friends made fun ofme quite a bit for it but it was mysupport system it was how I feltstrangers held me accountable and theysupport me and they uplifted me and thatwas how I kept going and I stayed strongbecause I didn't really have thatsupport around me at the time afterworking out for about six or sevenmonths I decided to enter my first NPCbikini competition I was encouraged bymy social media support online andwhatnot and even though it was verylonely physically and in person and itwas a very difficult experience to doalone I had that support and it wasstill better than waking up hungover andmiserable every single day so we met upat the rallying point and now we're offto film an adventure with a gym shirtcrew and I'm excited it's gonna be funI ended up placing second at my firstever MPC bikini competition which wassuch a rewarding and exciting experiencemore than anything I just wish that Ihad known about this like when I was 18years old and that I hadn't wasted thoseyears of my life kind of being miserablebut at the same time something good didcome of it from doing it at that timebecause Christian and I actuallycompeted in our first competitionstogether and though we didn't connectphysically at the competition we did endup connecting through Facebook laterbecause of that he actually convinced methen to start a YouTube channel becausethere wasn't a lot of female Fitnessrepresentation on YouTube at the time Icommuted back and forth from Houston andSan Antonio for a few months after thisand I finally decided that nothing wasreally keeping me in San Antonio so Imade the move to Houston after livingwith Christian for a few months inHouston he had to go to body power foran expo with his sponsor Jim shark andhe asked if I could go along with him soI got to go to England to Birmingham toexperience body power for the first timeand when I met the gym shark crew forthe first time I was really motivatedand inspired because it's this group ofvery young people they're all 20 early20s and doing so much for their livesand the food was so big and there's somany people there and it was just suchan electric atmosphere and so motivatingto be around these people likelike-minded people all kind of strivingfor this this better goal of fitness andthis kind of lifestyle that we were allliving after body power I came back toyou soon and continued kind ofcorresponding with the gym shirt guysand they ended up taking me on as anathlete initially when I started mysocial media growth and my social mediasharing I was doing it for support andfor accountability for myself but itgrew to be something where I just

sohigh-waistedand they look really small but theystretchum i think i pick these up in a sizesmalland they stay up the whole time i'mdancingthe whole time i'm exercising andthey're really comfortable as well likethey don't feeltoo tight even though they are veryfitted and yeah they're in this lovelyum blue color and they've got nothing toprovedown the side and they've got this likeribbed effectum but they're not too warm they looklike they'd be really warmbut they are very breathable so yeah i'mreally really pleased with this set andi think it is probablymy favorite sportswear set that i'veever gotso i would really highly recommendnothing to proveand they have so many different setsthey've gotthis set but in loads of differentcolors i really like the look of thepurple onethey of they also have an aftermath luxeum which looks really nice they havesome new shortsand so i think i'm definitely going tobe making more purchasesfrom them in the future um but yeah i'mreally really happy with thisso thank you so much jade because if itwasn't for her instagram i wouldn't havespotted itand i'm really really pleased with theseso next is everything that i gotfrom gymshark and i made

first is this t-shirt crop top andit's kind of like a darkgray purpley color it's a really lovelycolorum very different as well and it justsaysgym shark here uh where it's croppedand i just really love this it'd beperfect to wear with a crop top andleggings or shortsum i've worn it in rehearsals it'sreally comfortable and i got it in asize s and yeah i'm really pleased withthisnext is another t-shirt uh this is moreof a longer t-shirtand it is in this beautiful likebluey green color again and it just hasgym shark on the shoulder here and it'sreally really softand i have washed it because i've wornit and it has still come out of the umwash really soft i did put it on an easycare washum but yeah i'm really pleased with howthis has come outand it has a bit at the side that youcan tiei'll show you in the cutaway um but youcan make it more of a crop top if youlikeand yeah i really love this um i lovedwearing it with leggings you can alsowear it with shortsand you could also wear it as like acasual t-shirt with jeansum or out and about if you liked andthen ialso picked up a bra from gymshark andi've worn this to rehearsals and it isso so comfortable again it's a reallysoftfabric and it has this elasticated parthere that saysgym shark which makes it fit really welland it has some paddingum but i do believe yeah you can takeout the paddingum if you don't want it um but it givesit a really nice shapeand yeah i've washed this as well andit's come out really welland yeah i'm really really happy withthis um i can findsometimes sports bras can be reallyuncomfortableum but both sports

color and it's reallyflattering and it's just so comfortablei've worn it to rehearsalslike for the whole day and it's beengreat whilst dancingbut i would also wear it just around thehouse as casual wear because it is socomfortableit's got a little bit of padding as wellwhich you can take outbut it makes it a really nice shape andyeah i really really love it it hasnothing to prove just on the back andwhat i really like as well is thatinside it has a little quoteit just says be yourself everyone elseis taken and i just thought that was areally nice touch as wellum but yeah i'm really really

allseparately so you don't have to buy itas a setum but i did really want the matchingleggings as well andthese are honestly some of the bestleggings that i've foundthey don't fall down at all they're sohigh-waistedand they look really small but theystretchum i think i pick these up in a sizesmalland they stay up the whole time i'mdancingthe whole time i'm exercising andthey're really comfortable as well likethey don't feeltoo tight even though they are veryfitted and yeah they're in this lovelyum blue color and they've got nothing toprovedown the side and they've got this likeribbed effectum

hey guys so today I'm going to be doingmy gym shark Tryon and a little reviewclothing haul going to be showing youguys everything that they sent me I gota small in everything that I'm wearingexcept for one thing that and I'll tellyou guys when I show that what sizethose are so to start you can kind ofsee the padding in it but these are thenew seamless sports bras um they'resuper comfy they're super comfortablethey're really stretchy I like I said Igot a size small you can probably go asize down in these two if you wanted todepending on how tight you like yoursports bras I also have padding in itwhich you can kind of see in this lightif you put a shirt over it though youcan't see the outline of the padding Iknow some of my other sports bras thathave padding if I put a shirt over ityou can kind of still see like where thecups are lying this doesn't do that youcan just kind of see because of thelighting right now so I got that in thiscolor and it also comes in this graycolor I do like this one a little bitbetter just because of the color and youcan't see where the cups lie but thatthis is the seamless vest tank top isthe same material as these sports brasthere are extremely comfortable I thinkfrom their new collection this isprobably my favorite my favorite item--period just lookwhat I really like about this is itdoesn't come down too long like if Ipull it all the way down it sits rightbelow my hips I can kind of just scrunchit up and it will stay there it alsocomes in this seafoam I think seafoamgreen it might be like MIT Seco we'regoing to sharat's seafoam green but italso comes in this color same thing thisis also from their seamless seamlesscollection so it's just these shortsleeves at the same material this reallyreminds me of the I don't know exactlywhat it's called but it's the shortsleeve shirts from Lululemon it's veryvery close to same material if not Ilike this material a little bit betterit's just a little bit thicker so thisis what that looks likethe only thing I would say about theseis it as a little tight around the armsand I have I would say I have a littlebit bigger arms for somebody my size sofor these if you don't like it verytight around your arms and hugging yourarm pants I would say go a size up bowcomes in this dark charcoal gray coloras well alright so the next thing itthat they sent me were these sculptureshort they are their spandex they're notthe same material as Nike prosokay they're a bit more hot to me but Istill really like the material I'll trythem on for you guys they're really showyou what I've tried them on so these arethe sculpture short they really like hugyou around the waist but they're not tootight to where they're like pinching youat all they're very very stretchy againthese are the size small and then I alsogot them and the C green color as wellthe next thing I got were these burntout leggings so they have Jim shark allthe way up the side with the logo rightherewaistband is not too too tight but it issnug I have not worked out in these yetbut my guess is they they won't I don'tthink they will stay up as well as theFlex leggings just because thiswaistband is a lot smaller and a lotmore fitting to your waist but these arealso a different material they're morecotton like and then they also come inthis charcoal wish and pink that yoursame exact ones the black one same fitoh these ones are going to be the Flexleggings oh these are the ones that Igot an extra small so if you can seewhat I mean by the waistband it is a lottighter than the other ones it also sitsa bit higher but it is still very verystretchy it does you know it would pullon my skin if it was any tighter but itstays right here my entire workout thiswaistband does not move so that is why Ikind of like the tighter waistbandso far the Flex leggings are my favoriteleggings and the seamless tanks are myfavorite tops this is this sports bra Iwill have the name right here I'm notsure of the name right now thedifference between these and theseamless ones is these do not havebuilt-in padding at all it is literallyjust this material it is pretty snug soit does fit well and then the last thingthey sent me it was this black shirtthey be really sure how to read this tagit is a muscle tank it comes all the waydown on the sides it is a bit longer youcan kind of see goes all the way downwhat I like to do with this one is justpull it up and then I will like tie itin a knot in the back that is going tobe it for my jib shark haul now I'm notdone alright laughing they sent me wasthis air is it jacket this is the one Ihad on my Instagram photo has the gymtrack logo it has be a visionary rightdown here on the I don't even reallyknow what that part is called but it isvery very light it's all kind of remindsme like of a windbreaker take materialsuper light super comfortable just lookslike this it doesn't go down very fareven if I pull it down so far down itgoes one thing for these jackets you canwhy am I like scooting and talking onething for these jackets you can go asize up easily i hat tend to havebroader shoulders so like if I were togo like this it kind of gets a littletight I'm not going to you know be likehugging myself in it so it's fine for mebut that's another thing to look out forif maybe you're like hiin this or something I'm not really surebut yeah that's one thing it's a littlea few like that if you have broadshoulders but as for the fit in thelength of it I just don't really like itso I'm going to keep this size but yeahthat is it for my gym shark haul if youguys have any other specific questionsabout anything I showed or the exactname of it or a link or anything likethat leave it in the comments below andI will let you guys know the other thingthat I really want to get are the drivesculpture leggings but they were out ofstock at the moment but that is anotherthing that I heard is really good so,22,UC5soDJ-TwzErgFqIMGobpOg,Devon

are they gonna suit me do they only lookgood on you child models we're gonnafind out today you'll be doing thingsyou don't like doing in order to go onliving that is to go out doing thingsyou don't like doing hey guys welcomeback to my channel I'm back with anothervideo and today I'm going to be talkingabout Jim shock and I've got a reallyexciting video because there's gonna bea few little and I want to say like kindof like Secrets disclosures about Jimsharks that you really might want tostick around for to find out what thatisand yeah I wanted to do a sort ofaverage girl Jim shock haul because allthe videos I see on Jim chuckholesfeature really fit size 8 models andthey look incredible they look supermuscly and fit and just amazing but I'ma size 12 on my bottom half and I'msmaller on my top half very flat chestedrich I don't mindand it used to really bother me when Iwas younger but I'm over that now I'veaccepted to love myself and so shouldyouum boy I really I was a bit of a lostcause when I was looking around ayoutube videos featuring Jim shark holesbecause I really wanted to know whatsize that I should go for and are theygonna suit me did the only look good onJim sharp models we are gonna find outtoday so stick around and and I'm goingto go through all of the size in all ofthe quality and the shipping how I foundthe Black Friday mess the customerservice I do find it very good and but Ijust want to kind of like dive into somethings that I've found out recentlythrough Facebook through the grace fitUK Facebook group and yeah I just wantto kind of dive into dive into the insand outs of Jim shark so let's gookay so I've just put on the dreamyleggings by Jim shark they feel reallynice quality compared to my otherworkout pants and they fit really nicelythese are a medium and as I've said I'ma size 12mostly size 12 sometimes that you'llhave to get a full team because mybeauty doesn't fit but then it doesn'tfit my waist so I do struggle in termsof my bottom half but these are mediumand they fit really really nicely theside pockets are a really good featurebecause you can pop your phone in thereI always struggle when I'm at the gymwhere do you put your phone sometimes Ijust have to leave it on the floor justdo the workout because it just gets inthe way and so that's a really reallynice feature they're really thick nicequality and I have actually watched agirl on YouTube who is think she was asize 16 and she tried them she mighthave been an 18 actually she tried themlarge and pretty sure and said that thematerial was quite thin so just keep aneye on like this sizing because I'veheard rumors that the small and mediumare a little bit thicker than the largeand extra-large I'm not sure how truethat is as I say these are medium andthey're quite good quality just forreference and I'm quite sure I'm 5 foot2 ish and they come up to the ankle justoff the ankle and there's a little bitextra there's a little bit extra room soI probably could roll them up if you cansee em yeah they feel feel really nice Idon't know if you can see I'm quite farfrom my camera so I don't know if youcan see a camel toe going on you guyslike me no orcs and then these are likeI think nice top squat proof I did havea little noseythey were earlier and but let's justhave a lookyou can let me know and yeah they'requite high-waisted quite how I stoodthis is quite a cropped sports bra sousually if I have like a cropped top itwould come and cover this region becausethis is not looking very flattering Iwouldn't wear this with this this isjust because this is what I had onbefore I really liked the dreamyleggings I think they're so comfortableI tried to get my hands on the Flexleggings and I'm sure you'll know if youwent on the gym shark website on BlackFriday oh my god it was a nightmare andpretty much all the stock went in myfive minuteswell the majority of the stock by thedecent stock like the 7 pound 8 poundleggings they all went in like the first5 minutes so yeah so I'd highlyrecommend these if you are size 1214they are my stretchy I don't know Ithink you probably would be able to getin these if you were 14 depending onyour booty size etc but I highlyrecommend these these are a really goodquality the price I think these were theones that you only guess I only got a30% off yeah I got them in the dreamyleggings 2.0 and a steel blue and a sizemedium I think there were 26 pounds yeahI would highly recommend these this isthe seamless sports bra in black mallwhich was 7 pounds 20 I got this one ina small if it's really nicelyit doesn't like dig in too much and itcomes like quite um quite low down Ithink it's quite a good good length itdoes feel quite supportive supportivebut that's because I'm quite flatchested so I'm not sure about if you'vegot a bigger chest it's probably not themost supportive it's got quite atight-fitting waist island it's gotpadding in here that you can take outand yeah this was a 7 pound one day sothis had like 70% off witches and theyand I think it goes quite nicely withthis although although in the gym I'ddefinitely wear a top over my sports brajust cuz I just feel more comfortablelike that I'll show you the top nextit's the gym shark vital long sleevedcrop in blush nude mom this is what itlooks like I'll try it on for you Ithink this color looks really reallynice with the fees and still blueleggings it's got the standard gym sharkwhole thing but your son's through whichI really like some people don't some beable to just take that thumbs out andjust wear it like a normal topum and it's this top is quite croppedwhen I wear my normal sports for us Iwas doing it with this as well with itkind of pokes out at the bottom thesports bra but yeah this is a small andusually about an 8 to 10 on my top halfand number 12 on the bottom and this ishow the top fits fits really nicely I'mreally comfortable in this I don't feelrestricted and I think it's because it'sreally stretchy I would say you go foryour size yeah just feel it feels reallynice this wasn't slightly more expensiveit was 24 and it just still still feelsreally good quality and slightly thinnermaterial these I think these are theoriginal gym chuck leggings and I'mgonna be honest with you I'm not asimpressed with these as they're dreamyleggings I know these were way cheaperbut you can probably get some leggingsin Primark that are probably slightlybetter see than these I'm not gonna lieI don't actually think they're squatproof eitherI don't know maybe maybe not but I'msure they weren't that squat three-pointI looked in the mirror at these I got ina medium again it's got the gym sharklogo down the bottom yeah these to behonest they don't feel the best qualityand and that probably makes sensebecause I think these were like an oldrelease so maybe the quality is improvedI don't know they're quite they're notwas high-waisted as your other ones yeahI don't know these are medium as well Iwouldn't I wouldn't have recommend thesepersonally the next thing I'm showingyou is this cocky long-sleeved ribboncrop top which was 15 I really like thisI don't think it's worth fifteen quidthough it feels very cheap compared tothe of the pink topI wouldn't I mean I do like it I likethe fact that has these eitherdetachable as well these little ribbonthings it's a nice fit it does fitnicely but would I buy it again I'm notsure I probably wouldn't it's got theholes for your thumbs as well or you canjust obviously go like that I've gotthis in a small and it fits quite nicelyand I like the colour as well yeah Ilike them I like the color I wouldn'treally recommend this at though for 15pound 50 even in the sale I thinkoriginally it was like 25 quid which Imean come on Jim joke like it just feelsthe quality is just quite cheap feelscheap compared to the other the otherpieces in the range I just wanted to gothrough something that I did actuallysee on the Grace fit UK Facebook pageabout something that has happened andwith Jim shark and this is actually onthe internet anyway so I don't feel likeI'm like exposing them as suchbecause it's already it's alreadyinformation that's out there yeah sobasically what happened was this girlreceived Jim shock her Jim shock orderand then on one of the pieces it had ablack marker pen on like a line of blackmark pen on one of the tops and itwasn't small it was literally like thisbig so can you imagine spending all ofthat money and then receiving somethingwith black marker pen all over it soobviously if a mistakes happen and aslong as like a brand rectifies the orderand has good customer service then Idon't think the brand should bepenalized but the way this situation washandled was quite unprofessional so thegirl actually posted what had happenedand she basically contacted Jim sharkand I think it was like via facebookmessenger and she basically said to themlook my orders turned up with permanentmarker or marker pen on this top can youhelp me out pleaseand basically the person who was dealingwith itthought it was a joke which is reallyweird because why would someone jokeabout that that's not funnyand so from the Jim shark account theybasically like took the piss and wasjust like and yeah did you not expect toreceive you order like that if you paidwhat you paid kind of thing or somethingsomething along those lines are tryingat the screenshot but basically that itwas alone along those linesand the this girl couldn't believe itshe was like this is so unprofessionalthis is coming from the actual Twitteraccount or Facebook account and it'sjust a really bad customer service sothen she got in touch with anothercustomer service advisor on a differentplatform I think it might have beenFacebook and said look this is reallyunprofessional like I'm just trying tosort out my order I've received it likethis and and then anyway so someone onthe grace foot UK group saw this andthought this is ridiculous I'm going totweet direct directly tweets at Jimshock and at Ben Frances who owns Jimshark who that's what they did and saidlook this is really unprofessional thisis one of your team members who's justbeing stupid and so then Ben actuallygot in touch with this girl andrectified it and said this is really badthe staff members is basically gettingslacks because that's reallyunprofessional it's not what our brandsets out to do our brand is obviouslystriving to be a professional brand whopeople can trust so he ended up gettingin touch with her andrectifying it and I think he ended upsending her some compensationcompensation goods for compositecompensation and so in the end it didactually work okay work really well forthe girl she ended up getting somecompensation out of it and I just kindof wanted to like say that becausealthough obviously brands they makemistakes and also they might employpeople who really don't don't like theirjob and they don't really care which isprobably what this situation was but ifa brand rectifies it and turns it aroundthen I mean it does show that they aretrying to be a decent brand and althoughI have heard a lot of negative thingsabout Jim shark in terms of my orders Ihave not had any issues I've had areally really good experience with themapart from this the quality of this Iwould say and the quality of the blackpants but other than that so far I'vehad a really good experience with them Ijust thought I'd share that anyway justin case any of you are interested andyeah I think that's it I don't knowwhether to do hey Jim shark versus myprotein workout gear because I've got acouple of pairs of pants and from myprotein so if you want me to do like himmy protein versus shim shim jacques gymshark versus Primark workwe're because I know like Jim sharkIdzik is expensive like I would neverbought Jim shark full price because itis it's so expensive for the amount oftime I go for the gym is obviously isworth it because I pretty much go everyday to the gym but still like 80 poundfor a gym outfit is ridiculous and Iwould never pay that full price so yeahthese sales are amazing well unless Iwas rich one day you like and couldafford that but yeah it's about for agym outfit is it's quite expensive Ihope you enjoyed this video if you didplease give it a thumbs up and if you'renew don't forget to hit the subscribebutton i've got load more fitnesscontent

youman December second already time is justflying by before we know it it's gonnabe 2015 give me a new year for all of usand we're going to reset all of ourgoals and no hope for and work towardsan even better year than in 2014 I knowfor sure that that I'll be aimingtowards have a much better year 2014 inmany different ways I'm excited for itbut I also realized that change startsnow Jane starts today so I'm not reallyuh not really trying to put anything offuntil then so if there's something youknow you want to get working on rightnow or that you know that you want to doin 2015 it's probably best idea theystart making making those steps rightnow rather than waiting for that magicalclock of you know midnight January firstjust 15 because then there's also a goodchance that you like oh well you knowI'll wait until Monday we're all waituntil friday for whatever it may be sohopefully you know 2015 this is a yearthat we all work towards being better atin 2014 and just improve every singlearea of our lives that's why I'm reallyhoping for I'm really working towardsthat as well so I'm here at the gym andoverhead press day which is the mostcommon work out for me it seems likeevery day's in a red press daypractically is every other day has beenand one good thing I do have to say isthat my perfect turn my my PEC has beenfeeling much much better guys my PEC wasuh was a little weirded out you knowlike two or three weeks ago like I'vebeen telling you guys but um I've beenswitching out exercises that mightpossibly involve the chest even to theslightest degree such as like dumbbellcurls such as tricep pushdowns andtaking those things out and this lotyesterday I I didn't do a stiff legdeadliftI'd even do stiff leg deadlift simplybecause I've noticed that after I'vedone stiff leg deadlift I kind of feltsomething up in here in the past when Iwas having this issue so I feel like allthese different things I've been addingup or removing he'd say from my trainingprogram has really been helping my PECbe able to recover at a faster pace andI think it's just two more weeks andthen i'll be back into mentioning andi'll probably have to do something wherei work my way back up maybe spend thenext training cycle with a lowertraining max and then as i go throughthe training cycle perhaps increase itfive pounds back up to where i'mcurrently at such as you know decreaseat 20 pounds and then once i finish thatfirst workout at five finish the nextworkout add five finish the next workoutadd five something like that but then itdepends on how if I five lost anystrength or how it actually feels when Iget back into the benching so I'llevaluate how I feel with this deal aweek that I'll have after this trainingcycle and kind of gauge how I'm going tobe bringing back my bench press in termsof the training max itself and that's ifit feels good enough to even bench sohopefully it does you know hopefully I'mreally hoping for that so today'soverhead press days already the 10 setsa three day it's already the heavy daywhich was like one or just one or twooverhead press days ago interesting itwhat happened was a based on how I laidout this training cycle without thebench press workouts the order of theoverhead presses kind of was switched soI'm excited to see excited to see howthis goes today one thing I do feel isthat the more frequent I am doing acertain exercise which is overhead pressthe the better it feels and the better Ican the faster I can usually progress atit so I honestly feel more comfortableadding a five poundI feel really comfortable just sayadding a five-pound onto my training maxfrom i think it was 265 to now 270 feelcomfortable with that since I've beenhitting overhead press every third dayso it feels really comfortable whereasonce I bring that bench press back I maydecrease that to 4.5 or four poundsincrease in that training cycle but justthat much that much versus five so we'llsee how that goes but um yeah let's getin the gym now let's do this work I gotsome other things I got to do todayswitch is a good of a birthday party formy niece and some other things so yeahI'm gonna finish this free workout nowand again there and do it let's do it ohand i think i'm working with like like230 ish on overhead press hey guys letme know if the microphone and audioquality is better in this video or inthe previous one where i was using thatclip-on microphone please let me know inthe comments below okay forgive me ifi'm looking kind of pale or weird stilltesting out the lighting camera all thatgood stuff in this kook are watchingright now i'm doing it very very dynamicyou'll notice set of 5 reps overheadpress 95 pounds you'll notice that i'mreally pressing that as forcefully aspossible and someone may even think toforcefully but for me my elbows are nono pain from this movement ever ever soor shoulders so you know i go with whatworks and i go with what my body likesto do and even before doing that setthough since i kinda want to guide youguys through how i do warm upI will do you know two sets of just thebar for slow nice and slow reps bothpositive and negative with eight to tenreps so too slow sets of eight to tenreps and then finally a dynamic set likethe previous when you just saw with justthe bar then I moved to 95 pounds 45then I moved to 135 for free and now yousee me hitting 165 here for two and thisis all under you know the the contexti'm going to hit about 230 pounds for 10sets of three so this is how I'vebroking it up and now I think you'relooking at 200 pounds flat bread outthere and finally now i'm working withmy to 34 sets of three and this is thefirst one right here you'll notice themicroplates i think i got a one-pound urpoint seven five and then a point five ibelieve and i'll double check the weighti was using on a specific day looks likei was using two to twenty nine pointfive pounds so just under 2 30 otherwisei would have used 2.5 s per side butsince I'm being really precise to the tothe nearest point five on everythingright now those are the small sweets ihave I I ammake me shut me for the specific justcuz I like it because i have microplatesand allows me to be as specific aspossible to the actual weights andsupposed to hit based on thesepercentages of my training max everysingle set I'm forcing that bar up justas hard as I pushed that 95 pounds asfar as I did that 135 pounds and onceagain my work up was up to 230 pounds itwas the bar for one or two sets of niceand slow you know like eight to ten repsreally warming myself up and this isafter even this is on top of wall slidesmy shoulder drills with my bands that Ido basically my shoulders and elbows arenice and warmed up I even do you know aset a light pushdowns I do a set oflight curls even before beginning mywarm up sets with the overhead pressthis is how I like to do it guys andonce again working my way up to 30 itwas the bar for two light sets are tooslow sets of eight to ten bar for FastFive and then everything everything atthis point is dynamic so 95 for 5 135for 3 165 for to about 200 for one andthen my actual sets of 3 220 9.5 for 10to the 3 and Fayette covered I reps orMaya warmups now this is last set the10th set of 3 feeling pretty you knowactually knit all it'll prob was feelingpretty good honest that wasn't feelingtoo great haven't uh my sleeves beenkind of whack and

the brand okay so that justthat's some heads-up information so nowlet's get started so first thing we'regonna try out I'm gonna put theseall right these right here are thereflecting reflecting track pants on Jimshark it's the one they're the ones thatgoooo like if light shines on them thestripe and the shark thing goes verybright so you don't you'll run over I'mnot exactly sure the name of this but ifyou're into Jim sharks you'll know whatI'm talking about so I'm gonna put theseon and I'll keep these on pretty muchfor everything that I'm trying out andfirst we're gonna start off with thebasketball new basketball jerseystringer things so these are mediums sothis is a medium a basketball jerseystringer I'll put this one the blue oneon and the reflective track pants on andI'll let

medium mediummedium the seamless t-shirt alright sohere it is here's the red seamless teewhoa this is crazy the camera so it's ared seamless tear right here and it fitspretty well fitting pretty well so onceagain if your thicker than me youprobably get a large to be safe becauselook at look at the fit it's prettytight not super tight but it's it'sfitted it's fitted so we've got a coolbut a cool pattern it's got little dotsup and around your chest and it's alsogot the dots on the shouldershoulder right there and then all alldown the hall down the back it's got thedots though it's very breathablematerial so that's what the seamlesst-shirt the gym shorts looks like justright here this is the red one so nowI'm just gonna put on the amethyst andthe grey one just to show you what itlooks like just in case you're curiousall right here is the amethyst one itspurplish and it kind of looks blue inthe camera but trust me it's purple samefit same thing black logo black shimshark logo on the Left sleeve nothing onthe back so here it is- good look guys take a good look justkidding all rightlast of the seamless tees this is thegrey one black logo up here black Jimshark on the Left sleeve fitted prettytightI may have to get like if I'm bulkingand I go up to 165 pounds which was thepeak of my last boat I would probablyhave to get a large unless I unless Iwas comfortable with it being like skintight so there it is there's the backyeah so don't worry about this littlewrinkled appearance only because I havethe tag I have the tag still onso this fit is very good the fit the fiton the seamless tees is much better thanthe fit on the elements he's the elementto use have some kind of weird like trapspace up here these fit exactly right onso it's very good all right next one

everything I got today is amedium medium jerseys medium seamlesstees medium reflective track pants andhere we go last one and medium scoopneck t-shirt alright and here it is lastbut not least the scoop neck t-shirtalright so here this is a medium and totell you right off the bat this is madeout of like some stretched sheet somestretchy cotton so it feels really goodit's different from the seamless becausethe seamless is kind of like a polyestera little bit polyestersnext kind of field this is like a reallystretchy cotton kind of feel so it'spretty light it's pretty light and itfeels pretty breathable like it's nottoo you don't feel like it's super hotand they have shorter looks like theyhave shorter arm sleeves so you can likesee your bicep and stuff like that andthen of course it's got like a kind oflower scoop neck kind of thing so thatway if you've got upper pecs you can seeit like that so that's pretty cool andthen down here okay they got like theold I'm not sure if it's old but theoriginal Jim Stark logo with the themuscle sharp guy doing his reflects poseand then last thing to note over here onthe sides check it out it's like somemesh design maybe it's to look like ashark I don't know I don't know I'm notJim shark I didn't make this but theygot some mesh over here it really servesno purpose because under it's just thecotton like the rest of the shirt but Imean

HardingI mean I didn't really expect muchseeing how the video had like over ahundred thousand views Oh thousands andthousands of comments and maybe twopeople defended you and the rest agreewith me so couldn't really say much [ __ ]happens right moving on hopefully youlearn from this experience breathing onthe other hand was a little bit of halfand half I had probably just as manypeople reaching out to me thanking mefor exposing her and then some of herfans coming at me but I feel like I onlyhad a lot of her fans coming at mebecause she made three posts about mewith like 10 swipe left on each postparagraphs like this long of textbasically in my opinion justifying herprogram and her [ __ ] it's like Iexpect people to make a response rightbut it's almost like you're callingyourself out and you're digging your owngrave when you're making multipleresponses trying to justify it almostmakes you look even more guilty and Iactually had a few people reach out tome and be like I commented on her postthat she's making herself look guiltyand then she blocked me and I'm likewell that should probably tell youeverything you need to know I do want toread you to comments real quick this isone of her fans that reached out to meand was obviously upset I'm not gonnashow her name in her profile obviouslyand her profile was actually private soshe said she had great results Icouldn't see them just because Icouldn't see her profile but shebasically said you do realize puttingother people down doesn't make you getfollowers right I guess you will learnthe hard way there's a big differencebetween putting someone down and callingout their [ __ ] and I feel like thatreally needs to be stressed here therewere a lot of comments about me beingmisogynistic and I don't reallyunderstand how I can be misogynisticwhen I was literally comparing herworkout videos to other women's workoutvideos and showing the differences andwhy hers were garbage and the otherwomen's were great so that's just apathetic dumb ignorant thing to say butanyway so I've said to her I said youknow I have 2.4 million subscribersbecause I producedwith integrity and because I have beengiven such a wonderful gift and becausemy fan base trust me it pains me to seeso many of you blinded by [ __ ] andwasting your money on programs that havevery little thought structure behindthem you are not a fitness experthowever I am which is why I don't expectyou to know why a program is bad that iswhat you are paying money for for anexpert to help you you can live yourlife as a coward or you can call[ __ ] when you see it either way nomatter how pissed off you and be reallymight be at least now she would put morethought into her 12-week programming howhow you feel about me is irrelevantI'd rather you hate me but still makegains and not get scammed so I'm verynice with my reply her response was wellit's too bad you had to write a long asparagraph because I have done her guideand it worked wonders for me it's reallysad that you need to put down otherpeople to get views I don't think sheeven read my whole response not veryinfluential in my opinion and I don'tbelieve she's going to rewrite herprogram because one guide made a videoabout the random thoughts he came thathe came up with well she made threeposts for a reason okay my response wasremember that just as many if not morehave reached out to me saying the exactopposite as you when you plateau becausethere is zero overloading maybe you willchange your tune agree to disagree fornow have a great day and that was it andthen the other comment I want to read toyou was this one right here and she saidcame here and after Brie baby posted onher IG thank you for shedding like thisactually makes me feel betterconsidering I've tried her workouts butreached a plateau exactly what I justtalked about her post actually make mefeel like [ __ ] and basically as you guyscan see from my responses going back andforth I'm not putting her down I'mbasically saying like hey maybe she'llchange her tooth maybe she'll do betterprogramming and that is the whole pointof it's the guy that just to call peopleoh you're like hey we know you're tryingto sell some snake oil let's stop doingthat it actually kind of made me thinkabout something too when it comes to alot of these bleep programs there are aton of people out there selling bootyprograms a ton of women out there butthey're never getting called out and ifyou really just have to take a looka lot of them they're all pretty muchdoing the same exact thing which is whyit's hard to find a good booty programright so why would they call each otherout they're doing the same thing so theycalled out one girls program they to beexposing themselves and I feel likethat's why you don't see a lot of thatmaybe in the female side of the fitnessarea but in the man's side we're alwayscalling to come around like all the timeand that's just kind of like just theway men are right we don't care we justwe just go right for the throat butanyways because of all of this it mademe want to reach out and actually find aman who's doing booty stuff so thismatches was sent to me by Laura and shesaid it was okay for me to show her nameand her profile and she said Scott couldyou please use booty King in your nextinsta garbage video I can't stand any ofus content what he is sharing is pureneglect against the fitness industry buteven more importantly to all of hisfollowers I take personal offense to ithe's explaining how to do these flimsyexercises in the home slash gym but theform cues are close to non-existentthere is major butt wicking and what youknow is posterior pelvic tilt and theguy pushes me off she's really mad he'sseriously injuring people without themknowing all because he wants to helpfemales get Lodge asses he doesn'tunderstand that you need to work out theentire body with compounds progressiveoverload over time with adequate restproper food intake etc etc etc likeplease shut this Joe down I can't withhis content so right out of the gateafter reading Laura's comment to me sheunderstands what it takes to buildmuscle okay you can't just go to the gymand do flimsy exercises and expect tosee a lot of muscle gain and a lot ofpeople confusenewbie games with muscle gain if you'venever worked out your butt before andthis was my biggest issue with Bri babyif you've never worked out your buttbefore and you do a program thatinvolves trading your butt twice a weekwith a lot of volume yes you will see ayou will see changes you will see aresult but you were on a plateau veryquickly and that was the point that Itried to make in my last video and so Iresponded to her and I'm like I'll takea look and so with booty king it'sactuallyright Ricky it was like it was it wasdifficult it was difficult at firstbecause if you look through his profilehe's nine hundred twenty thousandfollowers number one booty bill they'reowning a owner of build a booty bands soclearly everything if you start goingthrough his content he uses bands allthe time and I have to give you creditman you're very creative what your bandwork and your cable work like there aresome exercises in here where I waslooking at it I was like oh pretty goodidea well I'll give credit where it'sdue he had some pretty creativeexercises for the booty using bands andcables but if you start to go throughhis contentit's almost made very clear that helearned just enough to know more thanyou and then try to sell you workoutprograms and what I mean by that is oneof the videos Ricky and I watch is thisone right here and it's called don't docardio before weights and in the videohe makes it very clear that he doesn'treally understand how energy systemswork in the body and you can watch thevideo we'll post the links to hisaccount obviously but he says he'stalking about how if you do cardiobefore weights you're gonna burn up allthe glycogen in your system so if youstart doing cardio for 20-30 minutesyou're depleting your muscles of theglycogen in the house glycogen is thecarbs that's what it's called when it'sstored in the muscle I guessgone like that and then you're gonnawork out and then your body is gonna usemuscle for energy and you're gonna losemuscle and you're gonna have loose skinall over the place any people that havelost so much weight and they're sayingyou're their skin is all hanging thisstuff is mainly because they did so muchcardio Oh God so what's really bad aboutthis video is he's really giving peoplea false perspective on what it means thediet correctly okay everybody knows youcan do cardio anytime you want the onlytime you're gonna lose muscle from doingtoo much cardio is if you're not eatingenough food calories in versus caloriesout period that's it right now if yourstrength training or trying to live tohave yourand he talks about how if you do cardiofirst you're gonna feel weaker in yourworkout and it's gonna affect the wayyou lift weights you're not gonna beable to build muscle and you're gonnastart losing muscle if you do cardiobefore weights but what he doesn'tunderstand is you don't feel weakerbecause all your glycogen disappearedout of your body you feel weaker becauseyou lost a lot of that tension that wasin your muscles because now your musclesare really warm you've got the bloodflowing and when your truck if you guyshave ever like say done some cardio andtried the benchpress before you'llnotice that you can't bench as much whybecause you lose a lot of elasticitythat helps you strength train and benchmore weight now there is some truth toif you're not eating enough food thenyou do cardio first then you go weighttrained you feel super sluggish becauseyou burned too many calories like thatis also true but that's not always thereason why it's bad to do cardio firstin my opinion if you want to do cardiofirst you should only be doing it beforecircuit training because it doesn'treally matter at that point the goal ofcircuit training is to burn as manycalories as possible if you enjoy doingcardio first as your warmup that's greatif you're trying to build muscle it'sgood the strength train first and thenmaybe do some cardio after if you needto burn a little extra calories and youcan still do cardio after strengthtraining and still be in a caloriesurplus if you're eating enough food sowe're not gonna get into all thelogistics of that because it's a loadedsubject for another video and then thisvideo right here also shows he doesn'treally understand how how dieting worksand he talks about why you might not belosing body fat he talks about howcooking cooking with olive oil is gonnamake you fat because of all the fats inthe olive oil something that's reallyimportant if you're ton of this body fatis when you cook your food you don'twant to cook it with oils like you knowyou you are you go and you're gonna makesome food cook some food most peoplethey put oil on here but the betteroption is to use nonstick calorie freecooking spray so you just use this sofood doesn't stick it's a better optionthan oil because oil has so much fat andit's gonna be hard on your body pannierso and it's like no dude like justbecause you cook with olive oil doesn'tmean all that fat goes to like like yourbody like like fat stores all right youneed fat like you have to have fat inyour diet you have to have the rightamount of fat your diet and in fact somany people cut like fats and salt outof their diets don't get enough sodiumand they don't get enough fat becausethey don't cook with it or use it intheir daily meals and that stuff isimportant the only time it's bad tomaybe cook with olive oil or or othersubstances that have a lot of fat is ifit's gonna make you go over you macrosfor the day as you guys know when youbuild a meal plan there's a certainamount of protein carbs and fat thatyou're supposed to have and as long asit fits your macros you can cook witholive oil maybe if you do your macrosand you're getting a lot of fats fromfood you're eating throughout the dayalready and then cooking with the oliveoil is gonna put you over what youshould be getting for your fats yeahthen maybe substitute it out for somecooking spray or buy like it was like aTeflon pan where it's nonstick right butsaying like oh you're fat and you're notlosing weight because you're cookingwith olive oil it's very ignorant in myopinion and the other thing Laura talkedabout was the form cues and that's wherethings started to become very clear tome where he doesn't fully understand howto do a lot of exercises for the bodyand that's why he sells bands and that'swhy he's super creative with his bandwork and his cables work because that'swhat he focuses on but take a look righthere you know he does post like this allthe time where he shows the bad way todo it and the right way to do it thisone my knees hurt when I lungeit's like okay but even in the good sideof the lunge you're still leaningforward in my opinion a little too muchwe should have a little bit of a notchin your back you should have your chestup and don't get me wrong if you'retrying to tag it a bit more glutes youwant to lean forward but you shouldstill be leaning forward where to slightarch in your back and your chest up toput that tension in the right spotthis one right here how to Romaniandeadlift both of these are wrong and inmy opinion the one that he has labeledwrong is closer to being right than theone on the right that he labeled iscorrectcuz with the Romanian deadlift you'renot supposed to bend over all the way aRomanian deadlift is about sitting backyou're not necessarily bending overyou're sitting back with your chest upand you want to bring the buy down toabout mid shin in fact on the left sideof this photo if she just brought herher arms in and the bow was touching hershin she'd be in the right position fora Romanian deadlift the photo on theright bending over way too much there isthe point in a Romanian deadlift whereonce you pass it that weight transitionsfrom being on your hamstrings to on yourlower back and being parallel like thisis gonna be that point and you can seethe same thing right here I feel it moreon my thighs when I do a single legglute bridge same thing though it's notbecause she's on her toe in the leftphoto it's because her foot is so faraway from her body that she can'tproperly push through her heel to flexher glutes to feel it when doing theexercise and if you scroll through allof his photos the the before and aftersthat he shows it's it's almost like justdifferent camera angles and it's alreadywomen who have big booties to begin withlike this one right here burn fat andbuild the booty say no more we on thatbooty program and in this photo likeliterally the girl looks exactly thesame except on the left she's wearing abathing suit that covers her butt and onthe right she's wearing a more like athong tight bathing suit that's pulledall the way up so you can see theoutsides of her booty and obviously theangle is much better so you can't betricked by stuff like this there arebasic principles you need to abide bywhen trying to build okay yes volume isgreat metabolic stress is great butthat's only gonna get you so farthat's gonna get you those newbie gainsin the very beginning but then you'regonna quickly plateau and when youplateau if you're not on a program thenof always progressive overload or we'reloading with a lot of weight takingthose reps from maybe doing 10 every setto sit to eight maybe even as low as sixadding her weight as you lower the repsif you don't have anything like thatstructured in your program you're gonnaplateau quick and then you're gonna beupset and then just like three babiesprogram you're gonna hit a point whereyou just don't see any more gains andwe're actually gonna take that conceptof progressive overload and we'rebring that into the next two accountsthat we're going to talk about one is onInstagram and another is on YouTube okayand before we start diving into thisthere's one thing that your boy missedthe hiding said correctly in his nannyor not the truth video anyone that is myfavorite pro 95% of these people are notgood at me not and with that in mindguys in my opinion okay this is myopinion in my opinion in case you don'tknow and my it's my opinion in myopinion if you're gonna follow advicefrom someone who's a competing IFBB ProI don't think a lot of the times theworkouts are gonna work for you andthese are some of the things that youneed to look out for okay and I'mspeaking in terms of muscle building andtalking about basically the same thingwe did for the booty King you need heavylifting and progressive overload incombination with high volume so withthat in mind what if my followersStephen sent me this profile right hereI have to be pro Niall and he was thisworkout called super child shoulders andbiceps and Stephen wanted to know ifthis is actually gonna build any musclenow before I jump into that let me justsay one thingobviously Niall looks great because Ihave to be pro he competes and when he'snot competing he's raving that's what hesays in his profile and when I talkabout people and I show their workoutsand their programs and whatnot it'sbased on whatever your goal is okay ifyou like to follow pages like thisbecause it gets you inspired to go tothe gym that's great but if you'refollowing a page and taking workoutadvice that's geared towards buildingmuscle and it's not gonna build musclebecause the advice is incorrect that'swhen we start to have a problem hereand now with Niall in particular I can'treally say for sure that these aremuscle building workouts on his pageI would assume in my opinion based onhow he looked that he's giving workoutsthat he does to look the way he does andhis fans want to try the workouts thathe's doing on it on a weekly basis Iwill tell you right now doing theworkouts he has on his page you're nevergonna look like him it's just ain'tgonna happenand as for reasons we talked about withthe booty King zero progressive overloadit's all high repsvol workouts lots of exercises notreally focusing on the ones that giveyou the most bang for your buck not alot of compound movements just a lot offluff and pretty things that look goodon camera which is how you get a lot oflikes on Instagram now this workoutright here it's called super Chadshoulders and biceps right rope curlsreared out rows lateral raises all fluffexercises no real super heavyoverloading the one exercises that hesays go heavy on is Reard outros howeverthe rep range is still 10 repetitionsshe's not even really overloading atthat I mean maybe if you're doing cheatand recovery you can overload with 10repsI wouldn't recommend going that high I'dstill keep it in the 6 to 8 reps 6 to 8rep range but as you watch the videohe's not doing cheatin recover he's justgoing a bit heavier and doing 10repetitions now could have easily madeus a more or you could have easily madethis a better muscle building workout ifyou had some heavy overhead pressing orsome heavy barbell curls right moving onanother workout he has on his page thisis chest and triceps cables only you'renever gonna get big doing cables onlyfor chest and triceps for reasons wejust discussed you need progressiveoverload you're never gonna be able todo the amount of work that you can getdone with a simple barbell bench pressthat you can do with cables like it'sjust impossible you cannot lift as muchweight overload your muscles with theamount of weight they need in order togrow and bust through plateaus and getbig but this workout is what is it sixexercises a lot of volume for the chestbut that's it just volume using cablesin my opinion not a great workout I'mnot gonna pick on him too much becauselike I said I don't know what hisoverall goal is he clearly likes to ravemaybe he's just showing you how to get agood pump and then go raid afterwardsrightjust like when you go out on a Fridaynight and go in the gym you hit a bunchof iron exercises and then you go outfeeling good so maybe he's just doingfeel-good workouts this YouTube channelon the other hand our boys Zach Poornais back in the housefavorite triceps compound movement ropepush downs in the house he posted avideo how to get big arms huge onworkout with Andreyou you how do you say his last name dieyou Andre die you USA vlog - and thereason why I'm calling out this video isfor the same exact reasons we've beentalking about this whole video of instagarbage there's almost like there's aconsistent theme here you have tooverload to grow muscle and with Zach'svideo he's saying in the title how toget big I'm huge I'm workout it shouldreally be called how to get huge arms ifyou train for the next hundred yearsdoing this workout and if you take alook at the exercise list you start offwith rope extensions his favoritecompound movement for triceps and theyalso say in the video you should startoff with triceps first because it's abigger muscle group because triceps isthree biceps is two right does that evenmatter you're trading your arms likeit's not like you're doing chest andtriceps where you would train chestfirst because it's the bigger musclegroup and the triceps are secondarymovers when you do all your chestexercises that makes senseyou wouldn't train triceps before chestbut training triceps before biceps itdoesn't matter in fact if you have ahard time with tricep exercises becauseyour elbows hurt it might actually beeven more beneficial for you to trainyour biceps first to get more blood inthe area and help warm up the area sowhen you get the triceps a lot of thatpain is gone obviously it is more to itthan that but it can definitely help soyou take a look at the exercise list andit's it's all it's all fluff exerciseswith super high repetitions okayrope extensions 10 to 15 repetitions andthen elbows forward variation untilfailure which is gonna be probably 15 to20 repetitions right you're going untilfailure skull Crusher's 12 repetitionsclose grip bench until failure reversegrip push down 12 repetitions spidercurls 12 repetitions and Static dumbbellcurls I don't know maybe they're hangingout with Tom Alice was trainer Pablo forthat exercise it looks really pretty inthe video because they're both prettylooking boys right IFBB Pro Andreand then Zack isn't here will thisworkout get you huge arms and that isthe point I'm trying to make no it ismisinformation and you get all thesefanboys at the time of us making thisvideo a hundred and fifty six thousandfive hundred and thirty nine fanboys gointo the gym to get huge M's doing aworkout that will not deliver Zack we'vealready called you out once for puttingout a dumb I'm workout and it looks likeyou didn't learn your lesson bro and Ireally don't understand what's sodifficult with making great contentthere is so many other YouTube channelsif you don't want to watch mine that'sfine so many other great channels outthere this is thing called Google whereyou can research how to build big armsyou can learn about things likemechanical tension you can learn aboutthings about the metabolic stress okaythe three muscle building mechanismsthat information is out there and justbecause your collabing with somebodydoesn't mean you have to throw yourmorals values and integrity out thewindow just to get views on your videoyou should have been like andre if we'regonna title the video how to get bigarms maybe we should incorporate someexercises in here that involves someoverloading so that the viewers watchingthe video if they want to try theworkout might actually get big oppsbecause this isn't gonna work forreasons unknown okay we'll just put itthat wayso overall guys when it comes toexercises and it comes to training andit comes to following people online youreally have to have your wits about younowadays because everything now is aboutviews okay everything is about beingpretty and being different to get viewsand that's why you have a lot of thesepages on Instagram that put out fluffexercises or different variations whichreally on variations it just made-up[ __ ] of exercises because when yousee that thumbnail on Instagram of anexercise you've never done beforeinstantly in

[Music]hello guys and welcome to my channel forJohn Shepherd Fitness today is a productreview and it's gonna be Jim shark HallyesI've finally got some more Jim sharkclothes and I've got two items that I'mgonna show you one is a jumper and theother is another vest because I do likemy vestsoh the packages come and you know whatfor the first time ever is actuallycaving one of these before I bought itsnooze you came in like a plastic blackJim sharkbite I don't know if it'sbecause I knew you came in winner and inthe big say or when they have like a bigmassive ordering because it doesn't seemto call me one of these but now it'squiet I Fitness spend a bit more timeactually packaging my things easierso yeah it's came in there Big Jim sharpbag I've already opened it by the wayyou know gosh I'm on because I'm notgoing to do a review on stuff it's notgood so first of all is the crucial droparm t-shirt alright basically a vest asyou can see it comes in with really nicepackaging I think they've improved thepackaging a bit if an eyewear is mediumand because I am a mediumeverywhere is a medium so if you wantedto know what size to get and you'rethinking about the similar size to meare basically 32 inch waistI'm about a 42 inch chest I'm 5 foot 9and I wear a medium I've never boughtanything from Jim shark with to do withleg so I wouldn't know about that or topwise that's what size I amso then this is what I've got is the newJim shark vest I would say and he's gotthat if you can see it's got the JimShaka logo on the front like you knowbordered box pink and let see wife lookslike obviously I've got a differentcolor yellow and I got because I saw LexGriffing wearing it so let's see what itlooks like obviously this is a very pumpsong obviously look a lot better whenI'm at the gymand there you have it it's as you cansee it comes down to pasha Lutzand it is a nice fit if you're lookingfor something a little bit baggy and ifyou're looking for something a littlebit tighter I - just get in the smallersize it depends but these are meant tobe quite loose all right and obviouslyif you're getting bigger and biggeryou're gonna be filling in half evenmore but and you see the back whenyou're doing your poses and blah blahblah I think it's about 20 just over 20pounds it wasn't too expensive but ofcourse for a vest or cut-offs he as youlike to call it it is quite expensivebut I'm quite happy with it now this isthe one I want to show you because I'vebeen one in the jumper for ages I keepon trying to buy a job that I want and Iwhat she wanted an alpha league one aswell but they always sold out and Iwanted this color but they didn't happenthis or a gray and I found the gray oneand I saw it I went you know what that'sa good price it's 40 pounds so what Igot was the ultra pullover hoodiealright to medium and same packaging asyou always get with you shop nicequality and this is and this is itthe camera actually does not do justiceyou can see this is the only part whereyou really know it's a gym sock top andthis zips up and this zips up all theway it's got the little symbol on thehoard got pulley strings around the hoodthis actually goes all the way up toyour chin um and it's got pocket whichgoes all the way through to the oversizeit is heavy it is really heavy andreally nice material 88% cottonseven percent polyester and 5% elastinwhich I haven't got a clue about hispinkie started to give it a bit ofstretch because it is as you can see hedoes it the stretch so let's see what itlooks like onas you can see that is it the logo onthe thing I told you it goes all the wayup so you can recognize that the Hordeis like that the fitting on your arms isgoodthe pockets it's all the way through asyou can see the back he's pretty muchbasic but this is what I wanted I wantedsomething that's basic but then I dolike that it's quite a rubbery textureso it says do not earn turbo driveexample melt probably and I like thelittle boots it's got just a little bitson the pockets like like there whereit's just little details drawstrings andthis was 40 pounds so you cannotcomplain I mean this is a medium as wellso when you think about it it's quitesnug on me I mean if I get any biggerI'm going to struggle putting this onbut it's supposed to be tight fittingand there you have it that is what thetwo things are bought and obviously theremain reason was I needed a hoodie andthat is because squatting if it hurts onmy back obviously when you're wearing at-shirt or a stringer or something likequite thin you you getting all theweight on your back of your shouldersand I wanted a hoodie because you don'treally need to wear stuff like that tosquash you want something nice and thickon your back to make it as much as makeit as comfortable as possible and alsoit's freezing down so nice you're kindand oh I basically and going to the gymand I'm just wearing t-shirts I want awarm up in somenoise like this and then obviously takeit off and wear my vest underneathanyway that is day four of my vloggingevery day in February I hope you enjoyedit if you're new to this channel go andsubscribe and give me a thumbs up if youwant to know anything about the twoprojects leave a comment down below andI'll answer them for youanyway I've now got to go get ready forwhere and I will see you tomorrow foranother vlog[Music],17,UCxanV24TwOu0KA2HaLWZC2A,zach lopez,77,7,0,129,"['Hoodie (Garment)', 'Sleeveless Shirt (Garment)', 'Review', 'Fitness (Media Genre)', 'Reviews', 'gym', 'bodybuilding', 'shredded', 'aesthetics', 'gymshark', 'gymshark review', 'fit tapered bottoms', 'Weight Training (Hobby)', 'muscles', 'Fitness (Magazine)', 'clothing review']",IN DEPTH- GYMSHARK FIT BOTTOMS &amp; SLEEVELESS HOODIE REVIEW,Yaa92K_nYHU,11464

[Music][Music]what's up guys and welcome back to mychannel so last week I posted a link tothese leggings on my Instagram storyafter I received them in the mail andyou guys went crazy and needed a reviewso I wanted to give it to you as soon aspossible but also side note that'ssomething I do a lot on my Instagram Ioften post links to leggings that arecoming back in stock just random dupesthat I haven't gotten around filming areview for so should probably go followso that you are always up to date onthat stuff but yeah so these are Amazondupes for the gym shark camo seamlesswith a booty scrunch people so these areby far the closest Stoops I have triedfor the gym shark camo collections theyonly have the leggings but they do havethem in all of the colors and theCasey's are sold out these are from thebrand new mo UGA's I thought it was newyoga but then when I googled that I gotsome pictures of cow leggings so it's moyou cannot move yoga but Ox Trucks hasalso come out with some camo dukes thatlook basically just like these ones so Ialso listed those down below in casethese are sold out because a lot of youbought them from when I posted onInstagram story so these are $29.99 withAmazon Prime which is a little moreexpensive than the ones you could get onAliexpress but I know some of you prefernot to shop on Aliexpress so I do liketo do both the Amazon and I'll Expressvideos so anyone can buy like whicheverones they want of these so in terms ofthe material they do list some materialonline but sometimes with these kinds ofsellers I find that the material theirlist isn't actually what the material islike the material they listed for thesecamel ones is the exact same compositionas the material for like two otherleggings that they sell so I feel likeit's not entirely accurate but I can saythat these really truly do feel exactlylike the camel once when I first openedthese I really honestly felt like theywere exactly the same as Jim shark thefabric feels so so similar it reallyfeels like that more like cotton II veryvery stretchy material and a little bitthickerthe camo seamless wore one of Jim sharksmore thick leggings soreally feel like this goes with that andguys they really feel incredibly similaryou have the same ribbing texture andeverything and on the waistband so Ilooked through my old gym sharkcam aseamless review because I no longer havethose because I returned a lot of thingsthat I review especially condemned chartbecause why would I keep the gym sockversion when I can have a version for aprice but I did look through my reviewsand I paid very close attention to allthe details that I noticed on thoseleggings so I did a waistband comparisonthe real gems are camo and the ombreseamless were the exact same height ofthe waist bands so I'm going to just doa quick comparison and this definitelymatches up these are geometric ombreseamless and this is where they startthese are the camos and they are theexact same height so that is definitelycontinuous with the gym char camos alsolooking at my previous video the printof the cam off looks nearly identicalit's a very delicate cam a print it kindof blends into the knit material of thefabric so it's a very subtle camo and Ibelieve that the camos they do reallylook exactly the same they also bothhave a gusset crotch and that looks verysimilar the seams look very similar aswell the seams of the gym shark onemight be a little more sturdy but Ifound that they were both very flexibleI did a little stretching in these andthe seams to not restrict me at all youcan see that they're still very stretchywe've talked about before some of tubechucks leggings the seams in the crotchare a little stiff and prevent you fromstretching fully but these I found arethe same as the camo ones and they don'treally restrict your movement at all theJewish Ark ones also hit right above mybelly button and I could actually seejust a tiny bit of my belly button thesedo come over my belly button but aboutto the same place I think that that isalso the same it's hard to tell becauseI'm not like comparing them side by sidebut at least we know that the waistbandis the same height and the booty scrunchon the gym shark once was just like afew little embroidery stitches and thebooty scratch one this one looks verysimilar you can see that it's scratchedbut it actually just as a bunch oflittle embroidery stitches that allowthat too like a lot of power to scrunchin a little bit I do notice when I wearthese though the booty scrunch kind ofstretches out a little bit so if you arelooking for morelike a scrunch effect I think I wouldsize up so that the leggings aren't likepulling so much on the but because myreally didn't scrunch all that much Ifound that the gym sharp ones scrunchedjust a little more overall I reallycan't tell any difference is I know I'mnot pulling them side-by-side but Ireally examined the video and I doremember what they feel like and theseare really really close so in terms ofsizing when I was putting these on I didfeel like they're a bit small but thisfabric has so much give to it it haslike the sideways stretching like thisway stretching you really can fit in tolike any size honestly there's so sostretchy I have a size small and I'malmost always a size small so I did gotrue to size but like I said I think ifyou size up you'd get a little more of abooty scrunch effect so if you'relooking for that I think you could dothat I also think these might run justlike a tad bit smaller than the gemshark ones but I also think that they'rejust a tiny bit stretch here I have noissue of camel toe at all of these and Ialso think these leggings are great forjust like sweat proof and cellulite it'sreally hard to cover up cellulite withjust a plain colored legging when youhave some kind of pattern like this it'snot like kind of looks like the patternof the camo in a way you know it like islike uneven and this is also an even soreally just camouflage is not right upso I think you're totally good forcellulite in these they're alsodefinitely a little bit thicker and alsofor sweat proof you definitely are goingto get some sweat in these because theyare like kind of a like cottony materialbut because of the camo print again yoursweat is just kind of going to look likethe dark spots in the candle so I reallydon't think it's going to be an issuefor that in terms of squat proof I justlooked in my little camera mirror Ireally didn't think that they weren'tsquat proof like they look pretty squatprove to me I'm gonna I all insert if Ihave other thoughts after looking at mycomputer but these are pretty good guyshe's also wear a full-length on me andagain I feel like they're good if you'retall because they have so much stretchto them this way that they can kind oflike you can kind of make them be aslong as you want in a way I've had noissues with the quality of theseleggings I feel like the stretchiness isreally great the fabric is overallreally great and I really really trulythink that these are maybe not an exacttube I don't know why I want to say thatthey're not an exact dupe but they areso so close that I really couldn't tellyou like this is definitely differentother than the fact that there's no logobut yeah stay tuned for the kamo doop onAliexpress coming very soon my frat boysgonna start grilling right outside mywindow that's not what I need todayalright so thank you guys so much forwatching and I hope you enjoyed thisvideo again I'm gonna have both the mowyuca and the aux tracks ones links

blue and grey of these these areclean man I'm liking the fieldI'm loving the field now as you gothrough a size test to make sure theyfit your boy no I'm sayingmy first impression after taking theseall over the package is they'reincredible I love the touch and feel ofthe fabric very soft and it's stilllight at the same point if you didn'tknow I'm really a big fan of leggingsespecially when I'm working out I don'treally work store it's the reason beingare theymy legs have a tendency to cool downvery quickly during workouts and I'velearned this back when I played collegefootball in New Mexico HighlandsUniversity I started wandering sweatsback then when we had two-day trainingsand spring training and all that stuffwhen I found out when I wore sweats myleg stays warmer and I was able to movemore efficiently and stay loosethroughout the workout but when I woreshorts during those workouts duringcollege ball I would tend to cramp up alot easier and my muscles would getreally tight transitioning into now anddoing Crossfit and going to go throughthose workouts I get asked all the timeyou live in Phoenix it's freakingsmoking out there's always like tripledigits in the summer why do you wearleggings and that's the reason whybecause even in hot temperature my legsdo very well wearing leggings and sweatsinstead of shorts and it's just apersonal preference thing for me plus Ireally love the style and how it lookswith you know the gear that you'rewearing in the gym and things like thatbut overall from a performance andfunctionality standpoint it works verywell for my body and I love the style ofleggings so that's why I roll with itlet's take a look at all the items thatwe have sitting here on the couch so aswe take a look at all this inventoryright here we dive in and we see we havethe blue leggings I have two of thosethe red leggings - two of the black oneof these gray ones with the black logoone of the gray with the whiteembroidered logo one of the blue withthe white embroider and two of the blackwith the embroidered logos on them I'mreally pumped to use this stuff like Isaid the customer service as far asgetting things on your quickly I'm veryimpressed by because shipping from theUK that here in two days that'simpressive to me I mean hands down to methat's a 5 out of 5 rating for me thequality of these pants just feeling themtouch of them - how how light they arebut they still feel very premium I meanI like that elasticity feel where itfeels like you have that stretch offeeling you're gonna have that stretchwhen you put these on in the waist areaand also on the legs it's gonna give youthat breathability in that room duringthe workouts without risking overheatingor doing anything during the workoutsbecause sometimes you get those fabricsthat cause your body to overheat toomuch these feel like they have enoughbreathability to you know aid you inyour performance especially during thosequads or long and rap type of workoutsso I'm very excited to use this so I'lldefinitely keep you posted as we startwearing this gear I think I can trywearing a pair tooduring that CrossFit open and I'll letyou know my overall review of once

yes guys how we doing and welcome backto another youtube video so last weekJim sharp on a sale so I thought it wasabout time I bought myself some new gymclothes I bought a few items which I'mgonna show you in today's cloven holebefore we go straight into the video goahead and hit that subscribe buttonI've got six different items in the saleone pair of shorts and five tops whichI'm gonna go through now I tell you whatI cannot wait to get a proper trim Ctcuts is coming too and then Barbara's inthe UK I finally finally reopened sosuper super excited to get skin fadesanyway you're gonna go straight intotoday's video as I said it's not gonnago I've got six different items five aret-shirts for tops and this is going tobe one pair of shorts so let's gostraight into the first item somethingI've been meaning to get for a while aswe're now into summer and then the backof the summer when it's gonna get alittle bit cooler but then it's notgonna be too cold it's a long sleevedtop so straight away saw this on thewebsite and thought I've got to havethat and I absolutely love this patternthis is an extra large everything that Iwent for with t-shirts and tops I wentstraight for an extra large for a littlebit of context I'm six foot one and I'mweighing like 93 kilos and I think extralarge is probably the perfect fit formyself so this top is absolutelyfantastic it's got a real real nicelength on the arms it's quite tightfitted which is cool it's not too baggyat the bottom because that's sometimeswhat you find with extra-large cloven isyou'll get a extra large top and it willfit really nicely but it'll be reallybaggy at the bottom so absolutelydelighted with this piece of clovenreally really happy with this so yetwhat a fantastic start as I said asecond ago as itnow some are and I myself I'm actuallyleaning down a minute and the protisleaning down a little bit for some artso I thought I'd get myself a vest and Iwanted to have something that was aslightly different color to what I wouldnormally get so I don't know what colorwith new class this as I guess like alight blue but it's got like a very verykind of hint it's like a mint like areally light mint color I would say I'veactually got a vest like this or acobble vest like this so I knew I knewit's gonna fit very very nicely andabsolutely love and just let the gymshark all the way down there so that isthat is really really cool I think thisin the sale was only made like 12 poundswhich is really cool just FY with everysingle item this is why I love Jim sharkI think every single item I think hadsix items I think the average of eachitem was like kind of 18 or 19 poundswhich is really really cool so yeahreally happy overall with this Jim sharkcool but yeah really like this vest aswell good two out of two I think this isthe only item where I'm potentially nothunting keen on just because it's alittle bit too thick material for myselfit is really really cool I love the kindof print of the gym sock it's slightlydifferent if you can see the color onhere but it is a very very dark greenand it's just slightly too thick it fitsreally really nicely around arms andlength as well but I've actually got ablack one very similar to this and Idon't wear it that often so it's one ofthose where I'm debating whether to keepit because it's a sale or potentiallysent back that being said I do reallylike it like I said like the print Ireally like the thing down here as wellthat's something that I do find with Jimshark they're very subtle with the tagsthe logos the wording as well just makesit very very aestheticand very easy on the ice oh yeah out ofall six items is probably my leastfavorites but nevertheless you know foryou know 20 pounds and absolute stealso yeah it's one of those kind ofweighing up whether to keep it will I bewearing it often but I'm yeah comingdown below if you've bought somethinglike this from Jim shark and if you likethis style of t-shirt this is probablyone of my favorites pieces from thewhole and this is just a plain kind ofblue jim shark t-shirt but it goesreally really nicely with my ownpersonal brand of team NC fitness withthe color blue and yeah I think there'san abscess deal I think it was like 10pounds 50 which is Mads again the logois looking really really cool extralarge as normal around the arms I thinkit's very similar to it basically is theblue version of this one I've gone whichdoesn't even notice but yeah it's areally really nice fit around the armsand length everything like that so yeahabsolutely delighted with thisparticular piece of clothing Idefinitely think this is my style of gymcloven where you know it's kind of gotlike a still a little bit loose but it'stight-fitting around the arms and it'sjust got like a simple logo a simpleprint of like that word and Jim sharksimple and kind of bold colors when Isay bold colors like just very like kindof dark yeah I think that's kind of mystyle that's kind of one what I'm intoso yeah like I said for ten fifty likeyou can't go wrong with this so yeahabsolutely lighted with this t-shirt ifyou are enjoying this youtube video guysgo ahead and hit that subscribe button Itried you clove in the halls probablyabout once a month sometimes Jim sharksometimes a sauce as well if you haven'tchecked those out go ahead and do soafter this video I'm gonna jump straightinto some shorts now and you can't gowrong with having lots of pairs ofshorts especially now with in thesummer and it's very very hot my set ishot at the moment it doesn't actuallylook that hot hasn't been for a whilebut like I said you can't go wrong Ithink at the moment as well when peoplehave training at home it's gonna getvery very hot going out for afternoonwalks if you like myself and I actuallylike training the morning as well doinga bit of a metcon in the morning like 15or 20 minute one you know I'm wearingshorts pretty much all day so I needlots of lots of pairs so sure on the gymshot sale and got myself these which arevery very nice loving the white kind ofstripe on the sides rate that highly aswell around the waist I actually havesome like Under Armour trousers thathave this style of like kind of likewaistband as such and then obviouslywith the the gym shot load which isreally really cool and the only downsidewith these shorts is that has no pocketsand I don't think I've actually everowned a pair of shorts with no pocketsbut it's like different Kylie said to melike do you need pockets for shorts andone has probably knocks my phones on menot actually my pocket it's my hand soyeah dunno do you need pockets forshorts I don't know but maybe do maybeyou don't but nevertheless these fitvery very nicely they've really kind ofI say tight rounds at the knee lengthbut they're just just not baggy they'renot like on that board shorts oranything like that so yeah I'll tell youwhat I'm absolutely delighted with thesepair of shorts the final item of thisclothing haul and you would have seen itin the fun now is this long-sleevet-shirt then we just pull that arm outright there loving this print love thisstyle as I was saying earlier just thatit's like simple black I kind of luckedout writing this really cool really likekind of what I'm all about so absolutelydelighted with this I would say the onlything with this particular item is I'mnot a massive fan of the bottom it kindof comes like under kind of got it'slong at the bottom and I'll itbut like I cropped the sides I could seewhat they've done that and it is reallyreally cool but potentially not for meso what I'm actually do with this itemjust cuz I like I really really do likeitI might just gonna tuck it into myshorts and I tend to do that with someof my gym clothes anyway is to tuck itin so yeah I tell you what absolutedelighted with this again with the longsleeve around the kind of wrists fitreally really nicely and yeah I'mabsolutely delighted with that commentdown below if you've actually gotsomething very similar though this isvery popular with a lot of people andobviously because it's part of the gymChuck's ow it's probably been around fora while so yeah comment down below letme know if you have one of these at homeso that is the gym shark Hall doneI've been waiting quite a long time tofind into this video so I can finallywear some of these clothes

hey guys what's up so I'm back againwith another legging review video B Jimshark legging review videos seem to bereally really popular and I have peoplehad a lot of follow-up questions to thatreview so I figured what I would do is Iwould break down the leggings that I dohave that actually do prefer over thegym shark leggings that I did purchaseand I will link that review to the gymshrek liking review here there will belike a little card for you guys and youcan click on that if you don't know whatI'm talking about also link it in thedescription box down below for you guysyou can check that one out but basicallyI'm going to give you guys a comparisonof the gym shark leggings versus Nikeleggings and I have three differenttypes of Nike leggings that I want tocompare it to and then also Lululemonleggings as well and I only have onekind of Lululemon leggingso one style but I will be showing youguys how it compares across the boardJim shark Nike and Lululemon I hope youguys enjoyed the review video if youguys have any questions commentswhatever just please leave them in thecomment section down below or feel freeto reach out to me on any of my socialmedia platforms but yeah thank you somuch for watching guys and I hope youguys enjoyed the video if you aren'tsubscribed already please make sure yousubscribe to you don't miss out onvideos like this one and yeah so here wego okay guys so the first leggings thatI'm going to pretty much show you guysare the Lululemon Lu high time luanpants and their these are the 7/8 typeof pants so that's their cut is a 7/8 sothey are and they do retail for $98 onthe Lululemon web site and in store andalso another thing is that they arelittle tiny bit see-through now theseare like navy blue color but if you goand you get like black they're fine um Idon't have any issues with the black onebut there are a little sheernot gonna lie but the fit is a very veryhuggable if you go and you see like theyhave a no dig type of waist man which iscompletely true I don't feel like I getmuffin top with these I don't feel likethey accentuate my kangaroo pouch beadsin terms of the tummy control I wouldprobably give these about maybe like an8 out of 10 which is saying somethingbecause if you have a little bit of atummy it is always an issue to find highrise leggings that don't accentuate itmore verses you know situating it lessso they are $98 they do have a hiddenpocket inside which is great and theyhave flat seams on the inner side theonly issue that I have with these isthat if you have that rub against eachother you will get pilling which arethose like little ball type of things onthe leggings and that's a huge issuebecause they are very like spandex styleso if you have anything that rubsagainst them they're going to get thatpilling and that's annoying but the goodthing about it is that Lululemon has areally really great return policy soanytime that that happens you can easilyreturn them so these next leggings arethe gym sharp dry sculpture leggingsthey retail for $43 on the website andthe biggest issue with these is one thesizing is weird on the website I am amedium in these particular leggings butI was told I could have been anywherebetween a small and a medium so it'skind of like up in the air in terms ofsizing I mean they're they feel kind ofum kind of like a spandex couple timesthat I wore them I did feel kind of likean itchy kind of sensation and I'mwondering if that's due to the meshsiding on the really coolthey do have that side pocket which Iwas told that other legging companiesalso have that so apparently in sign abig deal the biggest issue is how sharethey are and if you see here I purposelywore underwear with wording on thembecause they're completely sheer so ifyou are squatting in the gym shark drysculpture leggings just keep that inmindthat they are very sheer you saw it Ishowed you on their $43 which you'rethey're actually the cheapest of the allthe leggings that I will be showing youbut they don't have a like no dig kindof waistband like the Lululemon's dothey definitely accentuate your tummy ifyou do have one and they do accentuatelike muffin top and things like thatwhich I didn't preferably like now interms of tummy control these literallyprobably I would give them a 1 out of 10they don't have any tummy controlwhatsoever they're high waisted leggingsbut they don't have any type of tummycontrol in that waistband so it'ssomething to keep in mind but thefollowing ones are the Nike 2.0 Legendthese are the capri or crop style ofleggings so these are just shorterleggings now the 90 2.0 legend they'renot sheer and these are actually greatthe one thing I love about Nike is thatthey always have some type of patternsome type of just intricate design ontheir leggings is a very on trend and sothat's great about them now these Ialways purchase Nike Lite like Nikeleggings on their clearance section Inever never pay full price for them Ijust refused to because these legendTyson limited sub will check can retailanywhere from $90 which is like one ofthe you know on the higher end but youcan easily find them and I'm looking atone right now for about $64 and ninetyand since but I always wait for them tohave like that 20 extra 20 percent offclearance and if you aren't signed upfor Nikes newsletter you should sign upbecause then you get an extra 20 percentoff of that and it ends up being aboutfifty or so dollars which is still alittle bit more expensive than I guessyour gym trip lugging but the materialis like night and day the this one Iliterally in terms of tummy controlwould give it probably anywhere fromlike an 8.5 to like us I would sayanywhere from like a 7.5 to an 8.5they're really really good and they'renot technically high waisted leggingsbut they can they they can go up for meparticular because of my height andweight they can go up to about a highwaisted style now the next style thatyou're going to see here are just thesamethey're the nike legendary 2.0 type butthese are the actual pull pants and thisis a different style again I got theseon clearanceI paid probably at the most 64 dollarsfor these and they are hardly sheer theonly parts that are sheer on them that Iwould say would be the white parts umbut the design actually makes up forthat because no you know when you seethe design you're going to notice andI'm going to show you guys that thedesign makes it so that it's not verynoticeable if you're wearing underwearthat has like prints or anything likethat on it now again tummy control Iwould give these anywhere from an 8.5 uphonestly because they're not meant to behigh waisted pants or high waistedleggings but they can because of the wayI'm built or my height they are verylike I can just pull them up and they'reperfectly fine I don't feel like in anytimes that I'm working out and I've doneburpees I've done CrossFit styletraining I've done the only thing Ihaven't done in these is probably brandlike long distance running but Iwouldn't recommend these particularanswer that anyway now the next leggingsthat you're going to see are the Nikelegendary sculpt tight pants which arehigh waisted and they are meant to behigh waisted and these probably have atummy control of like a 9.5 and abovethese are a medium I have a large aswell in them and I finally got a mediumI got B's in outlet store and I paidless than I paid less than $50 for theseand they can retail anywhere from $100to 110 dollars depending on what youknow what kind of deals Nike is havingso full pricing retail anywhere from$100 for you but I paid about 50 or sodollars tummy control is through theroof on knees you're going to literallyfeel sucked in the best thing aboutthese is they do not have a like thatthe they have like a very like they'rethey're not sheer at allthey are very opaque I can squattinthese and regardless of whatever colorunderwear or whatever you know patternsor whatever I have on the on them likethey're fine they're not I don't lookcrazy they definitely don't give youthey like calm down that muffin top thatif you do have a muffin top and this isgoing to slim you down now keep in mindthat this medium fits me actually veryvery tight but the reason why I got themedium was because one I am leaning downbut to my largest getting a little bitloose at the top where your see likeright where my hands areit is getting loose right there at thetop so I decided to go with a mediumjust in case because I feel like after awhile after a few washes after a fewuses these will definitely get likestretch out at first they're going to bevery very tight and you could see youknow if you're really really payingattentionand you know if you're not wearing likethe right underwear as you coulddefinitely see that these will havepanty lines on them but there are greatpants out of all of them and to becompletely honest with you guys out ofall of these tights my top choices arelittle lemon high time pants becausethey just have a different type of fit Imean my only pet peeve is the pillingbut they definitely have a differenttype of fit and I like the 7/8 quartercut on them because they're not Caprithey're not cropped but they're also nota full pant so I do like that and I dolike that they're higher waisted then mysecond one would be probably the 90sculpt type pant and that is justbecause they're high waisted they havethat tummy control they're great pantsthe only thing is that they can be alittle bit long on per se but if you'retaller than me then you should be finethe third would be the Nike legend 2.0just because those aren't made highwaisted but their tummy control isseriously like through the roof on pointbut I do find myself having to pull mypants up a little bit more because theyaren't meant to be a high waisted tightnow the last of the bunch is definitelythe gym short ones unfortunately and Ican't return them because I've used themand I've squatted and dead lifted andthat you know and they're just not theydon't meet the bill between any of themso my recommendations guys I really hopethat you enjoyed the review I hope itwas informative if you have anyquestions or any follow-up questionsplease leave them in the comment sectiondown below and yeah anyways thank you somuch for watching please don't forget tosubscribe and like and share the videoand I'll see you guys in the next onebye,28,UC64DYvs1xM8ZeaCoxdjprVg,Plimsoll Publishing Ltd,0,0,0,2,No Tags,30 Second Analyst - Gymshark,Co8siIiJzcA,17
what's up guys welcome back to mychannel today I'm really excited becausehe put a lot of effort into this videotoday we'll be comparing my gym sharkombre seamless leggings with a brickseamless leggings from Amazon and I knowwhat you're thinking young before chefChuck is gonna win but guys I think youmight be surprised at the quality of theleggings I have an easy Apple onleggings so just a little backgroundI've always really loved Jim shark orsince like last year and ice likediscovered them I'm also sorry buzzingthis is flying anyways so I just haven'tfound it like that hard order from Jimshark with like everything's selling outall that I really need from the UK so Ikind of wanted to I came across theseAmazon leggings and they were deceptiveand I ordered them just to see if theywere like too good to be true so I'mcomparing both leggings on 13 differentpoints and we're gonna tally up thescoresand then we'll see who comes out as thewinner um obviously some scores are moreimportant than others like you knowmaybe like quality is more importantthan like length to some people so tokeep those in mind when I'm goingthrough all these points also some ofthis is subjective and based on how itfits on me and all that pretty goodoverview of the leggings so first thingsfirst here are the leggings so these arethe Amazon leggings and the brand isrunning girl you can see the logo rightthere and they're bothtomorrow but tomorrow look if tomorrowmeans like it kind of looks like littlestrike knees which does help to hidesweat which is good for both of theseleggings so yeah so these are the Amazonleggings and these are the gym sharksand there are different colors but Ithought but like both of them actuallycome in both these colors so first thingis price so the Amazon leggings for$15.99 with Free Shipping and the gymshark leggings worth $50 flat gym shirthas free shipping over $75 so if youwanted to buy the leggings alone theywouldn't be free shipping so you wouldhave to fight by shipping so that issomething to keep in mindso for price I think that the runninggirl leggings are the clear winnerit's so much cheaper that's a good $35off and you could buy like three pairsof these leggings and the time thatyou're in the same amount of price thatyou could buy shark leggings now we'lltalk about fabric so I was actually veryif you saw my last video I was I keptlike petting my legs and as my Macy'sthese are so soft they're both reallystretchy soft material I like on theseleggings I have a little detailing downthe bottom the gym sharks as well verystretchy the only thing is that they'rea little heavier so these are definitelymore lightweight and top band on theseit's like have like tummy control butone thing I do find about these is thatthe top actually stretches out a littlebit so while I'm you can see the videosbut while this I can lay flat against mystomach area this gates which I think Itend to prefer running girl leggings forthat reason I don't I don't feel likeone and overall better than the other wehave some similar but some similarlittle designs down the leg it's gotthese so Jim Chuck has a few more littledetailing so the leg than the runninggirls but I think overall I'm gonna givethese a tie for a fabric because I thinkthat they both have their benefits okayfit so for fit they both are fit me verywell not a lot of bagging there's nogaping they fit all the way up to mywaist area very nicely I think the onlyreason that I'm gonna say that Jim sharkwins on this one is because the ankle istight all the way down to the bottomwhile the running girl is a littlelooser on the bottom and that's alsopersonal preference I could prefer myleggings to be like super tight all theway to the bottom but if you like youknow want a little more relaxed of alook the red and girl leggings arelittle or a little more space in theankle area okay now to ease of orderingJim shark tends to come from the UKslash last time my packet itself camefrom China takes took a little over aweek to get to my house I think I'mgonna have well like I said earlier ifyou want to get free shipping you canspend over $75 so you can't get freeshipping with the leggings alone on theother hand the running girl leggings areshipped by Amazon if Amazon Prime theycame in they come in two days freeshipping no matter what about how muchyou guys can buy these leggings onlyfree shipping comes straight to yourdoor so I think for those reasons orease of ordering the Amazon leggings winnext point is sets so I had tip sharkwins on this one just because you areable to get a matching bra top or likeactual shirt that matches the ombrethese ombre leggings but with runninggirl they don't offer a matching top soyou would only have the bottoms here sothat is that's a win for Jim shark inthat one hey number six let's talk aboutlogos so Jim sharks logo is so theydon't have anything on the back this isback nothing there the only logo isright down the leg so that's the logo soJim shark it's pretty subtle I think Ilike this logo I do tend to like theback logosand I would kind of prefer if it didn'tsay Jim truck and I was just a short guyI like that better you run and girl logonot a huge fan of like they didn'treally try very hard I feel like fixingour boat running girl on it down theback but the one benefit is at least onthe gray ones it's not super noticeableso it's actually less than school thatthat I don't really love so okay we'regonna say - I envelope goes X we'regonna talk about the quality of the abreso I know if I'm looking for an ombre Iwant it to be a smooth transition aroundfeel like darker shades of the lightershade and not like blockyactually online the friend and girlleggings looked pretty blocky it lookslike dark grey lighter grey than lightgrey and it looks like pretty I don'tknow it looked almost like a color-blockbut as you can see the ones I actuallyhave a very smooth transition and itlooks like they really blended the moralin-between so definitely great qualityoperate on this one I also think there'sa great quality of ombre on the gymshark leggings like it's very verysmoothyou barely tell it when it transitionsso I think for quality of ombred theyare tied again I know I know you guysprobably want me to be like having onewin but I really don't think thatthere's enough difference to be a winnerhere and I don't want to like ask youthat had a results based on like suchlittle differences the rani girlleggings also seem to have a longerombre range like it seems to be blendingfor a longer amount of time all the gymsock ones don't take that long to ombrebut I don't think that makes I don'tthink that's enough to make the rottengirl leggings win completely okay nextwe're talking about high-waisted miss sothey're both super highways said theyboth come up to about my belly button Ibelieve from we're calling right thattheir friend and girl leggings come downa tiny bit in the back just cause mybutt take some space but I'm gonna putI'm gonna say time for now but I'm gonnaput the actual point right here once Iget a better look at like what I wore inthe video because I can't forget it okayso just checked in for high-waisted thisI think they're just covering my bellybutton and they probably cover more on ashorter person because I am 5 9 so Ihave quite a long torso so SWAT groupsthey're both swap repellents are clipsno you couldn't see a little skin butfor both of them I would still swattingthem in the Jan they're like prettyequal to me I would I would still usethem in the gym I don't think it's likea major issue I wouldn't call them sheerat all they're pretty they're both foryogiganother tie except for flattering andweights I mentioned earlier that the gymshark ones can't kind of stretch out inthe waist you can see in the video clipthat's not overly flush against mystomach and the running girls are rightflat against my stomach the gym trackones who are going to bounce back underwash but I haven't noticed anystretching in the running girls yet sothat's why I'm going to give this aroundto running girl next sciencing so gymshark has a range of sizes from extrasmall to large so that is four differentsizes while Brandon girl only has asmall medium as one size and largeextra-largeso definitely gym shark wins for thesizing I I'm like already not tiny and Iusually as small so I don't think ifyou're regularly like an extra small orlike in the z-rowsighs I don't think it'd be running orlike it will work for you so because ofthis I think the gym shark is gonna haveto win criticizing the four legs therunning girl is slightly shorter thanthe gym shark the gym shot goes all theway down to my ankle but they're runninggirl hovers like about an inch above soI don't think that meansthis is a sound cause like I am on theother side so if you are on the shorterside by the running girls will probablybe better for you well if you're on thetaller side the Jeb sharks will probablybe better for you in terms of going downto your ankle but if you don't care likeI don't really carefully used two legsgoing a little short on me that eitherwould really work so we're going to saythis is as high as well this kind ofdepends on your height weight refers inthe last measure pretty importantmeasure to its camel toe so it didn'tshow on camera that well but I've triedon the armor once before but you knowI've grown to kind of like not care somuch because like happen like tightseamless but I do find that the runninggirls disguise it a little more maybeit's because of color but I didn'tnotice a really bad problem the firstfew times I've worn theserunning a running girl the win here justbecause of thatso the completed tally is that Jim sharkhas nine and running girl has ten so Imean in terms of these 13 things I wastalking about the cheaper Amazon likingto beat to the gym sharks which is kindof crazy I know I'm definitely gonnaorder these again they're supercomfortable leggings like guys like youcan't you can't lose it these are $15you expect low quality and you getincredible quality um I don't know Imean I mean that speaks for itself solike in my opinion you're not losingmuch money on the Amazon leggings andyou'll probably trick people intothinking they're Jim sharks probablygonna order more from any girl let meknow if you guys enjoyed this video ifyou like this kind of comparison thing Iwas super excited to find a gym sharkdupe now you don't have to wait the youknow however long intelligence our gymchakra stocks they're calm breeze so letme know if you guys enjoyed this videoI was really fun to make so please thinkplease be sure to LIKE and subscribe youdid enjoy it and I'll see you guys nexttime

more snug I think yeah Ican squat fine in these overall verycute they feel like they have a littlebit of compression so nice I would sayif you have a you know a bootie thatsticks out on a smaller waist definitelygo for a smaller size because it doesseem to be a little bit bigger in thewaist if you go up a size so now this isthe vital seamless same as the last oneexcept for this is the Malibu Malibublue marl and this top is a medium thebottom is a small I think this is verycute feels like there's compression thecolor is really nice now isn't [ __ ]trueI think it is the pants are very tightI'm not sure if this material is gonnagive a little bit but I do think thereis a small chance but at some pointthese pants may give during a squad it'spossible but they are very cute

think it's really cute pricethis is the energy and seamless leggingsand matching crop top in dusky pink myfirst impressions of this is I reallylike this material I preferred thismaterial over the vital seamless it justseems to have a little bit more gift toit it's a little bit more flexible ifthey feel more comfortable the vitalseamless material so I really like thatI had this is my favorite top style sofar I love how it's a little bit more ofa crop top and a bra I think the coloris really cute it fits nice it has thesedetails in the back which i think isreally cuteare they SWAT crew personally I thinkthese are better for squatting than someof the other styles like I said thematerial seems to have a little bit moregive and I think this is really cutethis color is really niceit's got some nice details down at thebottom and it goes all the way down tothe ankles I'm not totally sure how Ifeel about this little crotch II bit myguess is that's like a little breathablepart but I do think it looks a littlebit weird not a deal-breaker but youknow all right so this is the energycropped seamless leg legging in tropicalsea blue and this is definitely myfavorite so far I love this color I lovethe crop I think these are really nicethe tops of the top is a medium bottomis a small they seem to be really goodsizes for me is it squat proof you knowit almost seems like because it'scropped there's a little bit moreflexibility around the crotch area andyes I think these are safely Scott curvesuper cute I'm definitely keeping thisone this one's definitely my favoritebut this is the fit legging and fitsports bra this is totally differentthan what I expected the material isreally soft and stretchy if I wasexpecting me to be more of like a cottonII kind of a material with some stretchin it but it's definitely not cottonreally comfortable really stretchy itdoesn't almost feel like it's so thin itcould fall down but it does have thiskind of sticky layer around thewaistband to keep it off so I think itwould stay up really cute really thinmaterial I believe is squat proof yesthese are definitely [ __ ] true verycomfy very thin material definitelyfeels like something that would be niceand summer weather there is no lining atall in the bra so you would need to weara bra underneath it which I wasn'texpecting but overall very cute nicecolor really comfy and flattering it'sdefinitely not a high waist it's morelike a mid waistband but very cute sothis wraps up my gym Chartrand hallreview video my overall review of gymshark is they make a lot of really

so we're back for another business stylevideo the last one went incrediblyincredibly well and that was all aroundstarting a business and this time we'regoing to talk about hiring staffbuilding teams and then taking that leapfrom being a lifestyle business andturning it into a more autonomousbusiness in the same way that Jim sharkis very easy to believe here and howI've been thinking you can do anythingright that was a little bit of a realitycheck for me where I sort of had tocheck my ego and go yeah leave them toitgenuinely if you want to grow yourbusiness that is the most importantthing that you can possibly do whenyou're hiring people you have to bemaking sure that these things aredead-on right so come on sass have tolearn to trust people to do things willgo wrong never to do things will gowrong with incredibly incredibly toughso last year I recorded a video that wasall around essentially my top tips forstarting your own business and I wascompletely overwhelmed and quite franklyquite shocked just how well-received itwas so what we're recording today is thenext part of that video so three mainthings I'm going to cover today numberone hiring staff number two buildingteams and number three making thattransition from being a lifestylebusiness into a proper business sonumber one hiring staff for me this isone of the most fundamental andimportant part of growing your businessthe reason why if you don't build yourteam and hire people that better thanwhat you are then inevitably you willeither fail or you're really limited byyour own time and skill set whichinevitably will mean the business willnot grow particularly big hiring staffwas like looking back was incrediblytough thing for me at the time so I'mbeing honest I was definitely which Ithink a lot of be able to start abusiness I will be definitely have a lotof self-confidence verging on arroganceI was definitely there I'm glad to saysince I've learned and I've sort ofmanaged to control my ego somewhat moreand I constantly work on that and tryand be the best that I possibly can andit's very easy to believe your own howI've been think that you can do anythingright now I worked very closely in sortof the tech and the IT side of thebusiness as well as the brand and theproduct there was just one thing that Idid then it was linking Shopify to atthe time the Royal Mail system it wasreally basic and it wasn't very good butit was worth it worked and it was mything and it was something that I wasreally proud of we hired a guy calledChris parents who is now our CTO who isincredibly talented and much moretalented in this side of the businessand on tech and ops and that sort ofthing much more talented than what I amnow he came in and he essentially tookthat system and he just sort of likechucked it in the bin and just made asignificantly better version and Iremember what was sort of watching himdo that and it felt like my heart wasbreaking because this thing that I'vemade that was really proud of and youknow it worked it was great it wasn'tmassively scalable but it worked just towatch him come in and just sort of cookit away so it wasn't good enough andbuild something bad that was a littlebit of a reality check for me where Isort of had to check my ego and go yeahleave them to it so anyone that isinitially hiringteams or hiring staff into their team orinto their business you will inevitablyfeel that but the right thing to do alot of people were saying you needtry and make yourself redundantgenuinely if you want to grow yourbusiness that is the most importantthing that you can possibly do you needto hire right people now what I'mtalking about great people that doesn'tmean go off to a university and say Iwant the top 1% in the class right Icould come in a variety of differentshapes and sizes that could be from atrust element it could be from a careelement it could be from a talentelement but something that we've learnedhere at Jim shark is it's not thatdifficult to find talented people tofind talented people that are humble andthat care and really truly believe inthe vision of the company that is reallyreally tough and so when you're hiringpeople you have to be making sure thatthese things are dead-on right so theyhave to be better than your what they'redoing they have to be culturally rightfor the business they have to be humbleand they have to be buying into thelong-term vision of the business is thatyou can have the most talented personthe most humble person you know theperson that's culturally like if theyjust don't get the long-term vision ofthe brand then at some point it's notgoing to work the other thing that theother point I'll just quickly took Johnwas I'm on this subject is one bad appleone sort of what we call in the businessin a gym soccer culture one ofthose people can absolutely likegenuinely damage a team's so so terriblyand and we've had that in the past andwe've had to deal with it really reallyquickly so and one of the sayings thatwe work with here at Jim shark is hireslow but fire fast and that doesn't meanthat we're you know a culture of we youknow our staff turnover is low we don'tlet people go very often because we wantto make the right hiring decisions atthe star but if you get the wrong personyou mean to make that decision veryquickly no keep it amicable have theconversation be very open and honestwith them but you have to make sure thatyou've got the right people in thebusiness or the right the right peopleon the bus as it were you need to makesure that the team that you are workingwith is completely aligned and they fitall four of those or tick boxes Ioutlined earlier that should be a greatstart in terms of you starting to buildout your business and and it'll be asnowball effect right if you get onereally good hire it'll it will affectand it will benefit your business somuch that from there it's just asnowball effect it will get better andbetter and betteryou'll get more confident doing it andyou'll see the benefits and you know Iguess the benefits will show in thebusinesses performance as well nextthing will be around building teams andlike its own it's very similar to thelastbut what I'm talking about here is so aswe started the higher stuff in the gymshop we split it in two distinct areasand front end of the business and backinto the business from the front end ofthe business as the obvious stuff as thesponsorship that's the marketing that'sthe brand in that's the product that'sall that sort of things that I guessit's the things that as a customeryou'll sort of see here in touch on theback end of the business and this iswhere I focused on the home and in theearly days of Jim Beam shop because Iwas really really poor at this side ofthings back into the business you hadoperations you had logistics you hadfinancing you had things like that andyou had sort of the backend elements ofproduct as well in there such as buy-inand so on and I remember at this stagethinking a member of school you'd lookat the sort of hierarchies and thingslike that and I think oh god is thisgetting a bit core for all of a suddenthis is really really really importantthat you understand the structure ofyour business and the best structure thestructure that makes the most sense foryour business when I look at and what Ido a lot of talks at sort of businessconferences and I do a lot of q and A'sand things like that and a lot of peopleask me around the USP of Jimmy shark andwhat makes you so really special andobviously they look at my lease or mysponsorship a lot of the things that wedo in terms of market in the brand inthe events all that sort of stuff butnot many of them ask questions aroundthe hierarchy in the structure andparticularly our sort ofdirect-to-consumer model that is so soso important and the way that we'vebuilt the business and all beer I won'tbe publicizing the hierarchies in theway that we structure the business butit's such a huge USP and it's somethingthat's so so vital because we've got anincredible level of fluidity in ourbusiness and in our structure and we'vegot an incredible method or anincredible way of making decisionsreally really quickly we get informationup through the structure of the businessreally really quickly we make decisionsreally really quicklyand that allows us you know to actionimplement and you know I guess to seethe rewards of those decisions supersuper fast and that's something that hasbeen really really important to us sinceday one and again this is something thatyou need to be thinking about you needto really carefully think about asyou're building teams how do these teamswork so beginning simple split for us inour particular business was front in theback end at that point then we startedto dig a little bit deeper so on thefront end every like a we're gonna havewe're like a marketing team maybe and wehave a bit of Brandon over here creativeis going to come in and you start tobuild this thing distinct team and againon the back end you'll have financing itjust extends ops and so onyou need to sort of understand theseareas and again you need great greatleaders in each area each and leader intheir area in each team should be againsubstantially better than what you areand then you should be able to take thatbackseat approach albeit very involvedso personally I'll I will take abackseat approach in terms of the way Imanage the marketing team at the momentI'm not massively in the day-to-dayhowever I will sort of try and work onmy skill set so if I do need to jump inthen I can but yeah build you need tobuild great teams you need to completelyunderstand the structure of the businesshow it works and I guess how it's how itadapts and how it changes as youcontinue to grow as well because that'simportant that's a mistake that we madeat the start we we build a structure Imean stand in front of everyone and we'dsay this is the gym shot structure nowfor the next two or three years and likethree or four months down the line we'dbe like okay now this is the newstructure and people started saying wellyou know three or four months ago yousaid this will be the trip for two yearsand now you're changing it again I thinkthat's also quite important as you arebuilding teams particularly if you'reworking in a fast growing business youneed to have that open sort of dialogueand you need to say this is what wethink works now we might change on itand by the way regardless even if we areright as the business grows or as weadapt this might change so yeah and it'salso about understanding the differenttypes of people that work across thebusiness right you know in the front endyou may have a slightly different typeof individual in terms of their skillshave been in the back end and it's aboutjust understanding that maybe flexingyour style as you're working withdifferent types of people or differentindividuals it's your time being ascompletely open transparent and honestas possible with everyone across thebusiness so these two things combinedthe monks of the thing will help you totransition from being a lifestylebusiness into more of what I'd call likea proper business for lack of a betterword just so that everyone's aware aswell a lifestyle business is sort oflike generally one person maybe three orfour it's built in a way where thebusiness will probably make decentprofit and the I guess the leaders willdelete you just and live off that profitas you hire more people and then youbuild a bigger team obviously you gonnabe eating away at that profit and whichis why I'm why I talk about it being atransition and it's it it's a transitionthat I think you need to be really clearwith yourself that you want to makethere is nothing wrong with what runninga great lifestyle business and living agreat life with it transitioning into alarger sized business with a bunch ofstaff with lots of teamsmany offices and so on that comes withyou know albeit a lot of positives it'sgreat opportunity for growth like I findit personally I find it massivelyfulfilling because I get to be aroundincredible people every single day butit also comes with a lot more risk itcomes with a lot more stress it's a verytough it's very difficult the hours arelong and obviously generally you'll findthe profit will come down because you'vegot a higher cost base in the businessit's it's a transition that I think youneed to think long and hard about beforeyou decide to make it now assuming thatyou do want to take that leap and moveinto a larger sized business you need tobe aware that as you're bringing insystems as you bring it in officesyou're bringing in people and so onthings will go wrong inevitably thingswill go wrong and it's incrediblyincredibly tough I think the other thingthat in terms of transition into into alarger business I learned was you haveto learn to trust you have to learn totrust people to do things you can'tconstantly be sort of like looking overtheir shoulder or making sure thatthey're doing an alright job you have totrust people to do a good job and thenyou know obviously they'll bring it backto you and you can have a look at itwhen it's done so to give you a tangibleexample in mind from my point of viewfrom Jim shark I brought in two peopleSteve Hewitt and Paul Richardson soSteve currently is the CEO and Paul isthe chairman and these people reallyhelped mentor me and help me to learnand understand and and you know taughtme to trust people as well by the way atthis point experience is very veryimportant it's very difficult forsomeone that's never done it before togo off and do it without making a ton ofmistakes that can inevitably slow youdown so if you can get experience and ifyou can get people in that worked in asizeable business before or constantlyask for advice then I think that'sreally really important I was very luckyand very fortunate I've spoken a lotabout Jim sharks or the stars aligningto get into where we are today I happento go into my local gym happened to meetPaul at the local gym who happened tointroduce me to Steve like all thesestars had to align so but equally withthat I had to sort of be there for theopportunity to present themselves to meso like I said if you're making thisdecision find people like that like whatPaul and Steve offered to me and whohave experience in larger scalebusinesses and you can have a look atsomething like this is where we are nowthis is where we want to be and you haveto draw out what that looks like for youand like I said be prepared to take thatrisk because inevitably it's a big riskit's tough it's stressful and it's yeahit's incredibly hard work but personallyfor me it's goingvery well and I'm very happy with wherewe are today now I know that a lot ofthis advice is very very top-line I'vetried to apply as many sort of real-lifeexamples from my experience as possibleI know it's incredibly hard the onething I would say is there is nothingwrong with having a great lifestylebusiness and I think in 99 times out andit makes a lot of sense but equallyunderstand that some people would willwant to take the same need that we did agym shark and they will want to create asort of a large-scale business it is oneof the most incredible and fulfillingthings I have ever done in my life and Icannot stress that enough it's beenincredibly hard it's pushed me to myabsolute limit I found it physicallytiring I found it mentally draining itis like I said it is push me to myabsolute limit but I wouldn't have itany other way because I have learned somuch and I'm so fortunate that I get tocome into an office of incrediblytalented people from all around theworld every single day and I get

"if you go into any gym anytime you'lltypically see people wearing the samesort of fitness clothing clothing madeby brands that have been established fordecades they spend billions of dollarson advertising companies like Nike addedass Puma Reebok Jim shark Jim shark yeahcuz since 2012 Jim shark has gone frombasically a couple of guys in a garagesewing labels onto t-shirts to a genuineheavy hitter one of the world's mostcompetitive apparel Marcus sportswearthey've gone from zero to an estimatedturnover in excess of a hundred andfifty million pounds they've done thiswith no funding and the founder of thecompany was 19 years old in 2012 this isone of the greatest business growthstories of our generation and prettymuch just using this and they're justgetting started my name is Tim Cameronkitchen and I'm headin in J at a digitalmarketing agency called exposure ninjanow we love reverse engineering growthstories of businesses like Jim shock tofind out how they've done it and in thisvideo we're gonna do exactly that I'mgonna show you the marketing that hashelped Jim shark to go from zero to overone hundred and fifty million pounds inrevenue we're going to look at how theirwebsite has evolved over time we'regonna take a look at their social mediaparticularly looking at how their use ofinfluencer marketing has really kind ofdefined or redefined that category we'regonna take a look at SEO what they'redoing with pay-per-click ads and we'regonna put it all together into somelessons that you can learn if you'relooking to tap into some of thatridiculous growth for your business sobuckle up sit back and enjoy[Music]now Jim sharks first year in businesswas 2012 so the first full year ofaccounts is from 2013 and if we take alook at what their retained earningswere over the years we can see just howrapidly the company has grown andretained earnings is the amount of moneythat the company keeps after payingdividend to shareholders it's basicallymoney that is retained by the companyover time so retained earnings at theend of year one 90,000 pounds which is areasonable first year by the end of yeartwo this had jumped to 1 point 1 7million pounds which is a pretty goodsecond year and it shows just howdramatically Jim sharks growth was assoon as they got started by year 3that's arisen to 1.9 million year for2.6 million yeah 5 this jumpeddramatically to over 9 million and byyear 6 it jumped dramatically again thistime to over 23 million pounds now wedon't know what Jim sharks revenue wasover the first two years of the businessbut we do know that by year 3 thatrevenue was eight point seven millionpounds now many businesses it takes themyou know a very long time to get to thatsort of revenue so clearly Jim sharkssomething happened in that first coupleof years I'm gonna show you exactly whatthat thing was a little bit later onmeanwhile revenue in year four jumped totwelve point seven million revenue nearfive grew to over forty million inrevenue in year six past one hundred andthree millionnow the time of making this video at thetail end of 2019 Jim shark haven't yetsubmitted their full year accounts foryear seven but it would be a veryconservative estimate that put theirrevenue or anything or less than say 160to 200 million pounds now these sorts ofgrowth numbers are insane we're used toseeing tech companies with overinflatedvaluations based on desperate investorspiling cash into a business that is nearprofitable but what we're talking abouthere is a real profitable business thatis making money selling physicalproducts you know you've got to sell alot of t-shirts to get to over 103million pounds in rowand the growth continues in 2016 Jimshark was named the number onefastest-growing retailer in the UK andalso tops the Sunday Times fast track100 this year and of course the brandhas millions of followers across all itssocial media channels as wellso how has all of this happened in sucha relatively short space of time wellthe first thing we're gonna do is goback to the very early days of Jim sharkto see how the business was founded andhow they chose in particular thesportswear markets and after suffice tosay we won't be talking about Jim sharktoday if Ben francis had decided tostart a typewriter businessJim shark was one of seven differentwebsites that Ben was running at thattime first version of Jim shark actuallysold supplements but then realized thatthe marginal supplements wasn't verygood so moved over into clothing and thefirst version of the gym shark clothingwebsite actually sold lots of differentbrands of clothing which they didn'tport as well as Jim shark same brand sowhat was the fitness clothing marketlike at the time that Jim shark wasfounded well the story goes that Jimgoes really had two choices they couldeither wear baggy kind of ill-fittingclothing designed for body builders orthey could have more expensive kind ofperformance focused clothing whichwasn't necessarily designed to look goodso what Ben and his co-founder reallywanted to do was design a range of morefitted clothing which kind of madepeople look good but you could alsoworkout in it now Ben talks a lot aboutmaking the sort of clothing that hewanted to wear and actually this is thefirst lesson in the Jim shark story beenrepeatedly talks about himself as thetarget audience and really he was he was19 years old gym goerwanted this sort of more fitted clothingso pretty much the first version of theproduct was designed for people lookjust like him and one of the things Inoticed as I was researching this isthat throughout a lot of Ben'sinterviews he talks about designing theevents that he would want to go to hetalks about designing the clothing thathe want to go to the app that he wouldwant really he is the audience thefounder of the business is the audienceand that gives him great power becausehe understands what his audience withone so the Jim truck team designed arange of fitted clothingthat looked good and they sold it anaffordable price that actually youngpeople would be able to afford this wastheir breakout product this is the luxetracksuit this shot has also taken fromJim sharks Instagram in the very earlydays and here we see a couple ofbodybuilders this is Jeff seid and someother massive fatty wearing those Jimshark luxe joggers it's important tonote this is in the very early days ofJim shark these are two fitnessinfluences we'll come back to theimportance of influencer marketing buteven from these very early days we cansee from looking through the comments tothese posts the product was a direct hitwith the audience people were ravingabout these joggers they really reallywanted the joggers as much as it mightseem like a basic thing to have a pairof reasonably fitted joggers actuallyback then this wasn't that common nowwith such more an influencer marketinglater on but to say that influencermarketing has been important to thegrowth of Jim shark is a little bit likesaying snow is important to skiingreally influences are the DNA and I'deven say the backbone of Jim shark todaythere's another early Jim sharkambassador a guy called Matt focus againwearing the joggers the second importantlesson is that in these early days youdon't see loads and loads of differentJim shark branded products because theminimum order quantity for these joggersand these tops these track cease was sohigh that Jim shark didn't have enoughmoney to buy lots of other products sothey pretty much started with one mainproduct this luxe track see again areally important lesson what we've gothere is a very clearly defined targetaudience of like late teens earlytwenties bodybuilders and we've got oneproducts which were selling to them andthe product is selling well and it'spopular and people like it so this is avery very simple business at this stagenow obviously Jim shark strategy hasevolved a little since these pictureswere taken in 2013 wait actually no ithasn'tthey found a great formula and they'verepeated it ever since which is lessonnumber two from studying the very earlydays of Jim shark it doesn't seem thatthe founders hada huge long-term vision for the brandbecause they ended up reversing a numberof kind of micro decisions they made inthese early days but what it reallyseems to be is a genuine case of puttingone foot in front of the other they hada clear idea of their target audiencethey had one product which was popularand they sold it and they had really onemarketing strategy to do that and thenthey just kept repeating it and doing itover and over and over again themarketing strategy was rightthe audience was right the product wasright the timing was rightbeen the founder understands thisaudience but a whole lot of people haveworked hard to get this to grow how itso let's break down this marketingstrategy in a bit more detail the firststep to designing any marketing strategyis the target audience because thetarget audience defines everything elsethat you do and what you sell we'vealready said that Ben was the targetaudience for Jim shark so he clearlyunderstood this market very deeply if wedig back into the time capsule that isthe early days of the Jim sharkInstagram feed we can actually see thistarget audience very clearly in fact thebrand started off clearly focused onmales of a particular age the first 90Instagram posts feature only threepictures with women and they're kind offrom a male perspective to be honestthis is pure 20-something bodybuilderbro culture this is not all athletes allages all genders this is if you're a20-something guy who goes to the gym alot and aspires to be shredded likethese guys welcome you've found yourhome and that's why it resonated so wellin the early days with people that wereinto this because if you're into thisyou were gonna get a whole lot of itfrom Jim shark and this is a reallyimportant point can you imagine tryingto launch a company like Nike fromscratch working across all thesedifferent sports all these differentkind of segmented little audiences bereally tricky to do particularly ifyou're on a limited budget so if you'reon a limited budget and you're lookingfor insane growth much better to focuson one very focused audience and giveeverything that you possibly can in thatspace now the temptation when you're asmall business starting up can be tokind of second-guess yourself and trylots of different thingsso we've worked with hundreds of smallbusinesses at exposure ninja and willoften see that a small business ownerwill start off by selling one product toone audience they'll then say maybe weshould try another product to thataudience it doesn't seem to be workinglet's try a slightly different audienceand let's try some more differentmarketing channels let's try this thingas well because they might want to buythat too and what we end up finding isthat they're doing lots of differentthings in slightly different areas andit means that energy is kind ofdistributed in lots of differentdirections what we see on the other handwould Jim shark in the early days isthat actually their energy has kind ofgone in one direction now the sameamount of energy therefore can get youmuch further than if you're kind ofspreading it around in lots of differentdirections and of course over time it'simportant that the business expands outadds a new product line and that'sexactly what we've seen Jim shark do butmost importantly they've had this earlytraction to begin with which has giventhem some leverage and then they'vestarted adding more products on it'simportant to find something that worksand then keep doing it don't getdistracted and get pulled in anotherdirectionwell they've really done is they foundsomething that works and they've keptdoing it rather than getting pulled in adifferent direction almost immediatelythe first sign of a Jim shark woman'srange was 2013 although obviously it'sbeen through many iterations to get tothe sort of quality of products that wesee today but it's important to knowthat there was actually pent up demandfor this already because the brand hasbuilt up such a following amongst guybody builders it had inevitablyattracted the attention of women as wellso there was actually people who wereasking for Jim shark women's clothingthis wasn't them saying right let's justmake everything all at once so thiswasn't Jim shark kind of forcingthemselves into a new market this wasthem responding to demand another keyprinciple in the early days of Jim Cottsgrowth is that they were sellingsomething that people actually wantedthe importance of this can't beoverstated you can't get to this levelof growth selling something that peopledon't want or just aren't fast aboutlife is so much easier if you don't haveto Ram your product down people'sthroats in order for them to want to buyit now because people wanted this luxetracksuit that they've made they startedslightly expandingyou can see how they use their socialmedia channels to test different colorways for example by doing this they alsokept the audience involved in thebrand's great they were looking to theircustomers to tell them where to go nextthis isn't being massively inventivethis is creating one product that peoplelike and saying hey do you want it in adifferent color another really gooddecision that the Jim Kirk team madequite early on in the business is tochange the logo this is the originallogo from 2012 this logo is reallymasculine really aggressive and clearlyit's gonna limit the brand's reach so in2014 they started transitioning to a newmore iconic and gender-neutral logo thislogo is so much more flexible and theoriginal brief was to create somethingthat was iconic as brands like Nike andAdidas so we can also see how from theearly days of Jim sharks saying rightwe're just gonna make Jim clothing forbro body builders and we want a logowhich is like a big old muscley shark wecan see actually how the vision of thebrand had started to expand now becausethey wanted something which could sitalongside Nike and added ass and looklike it was part of that type of thingcuz they'd gone from wanting somethingwhich was like a big old muscley sharkwhich eliminates kind of 98% of theentire world's population to actuallysomething which they felt comfortableputting up against Nike and added ass soit shows how the vision grew even overthe first couple of years of the companythis was a really important move and itshows a kind of maturity that they'rewilling to move away from the thingsthat have made them successful what gotus here won't get us there kind ofmentality but also there was a bit of abacklash I mean very minor backlash butamongst some of the kind of hardcorebodybuilding people they felt like themasculine aggressive Jim shark logoactually kind of more represented whatthey were about so here we see thebrands starting to make decisions basedon what's gonna help us get to a muchbigger end point it's important toremember that Jim shark is an e-commercebusiness you buy jim sharks clothingthrough its website you don't go to asports shop they don't sell throughdistributors it's all done centrally andlike any e-commerce business the websiteis central to its success so let's takea look how the website has evolvedthrough the years now Ben has actuallybuiltwebsites himself since he was aboutsixteen so this is the first version ofthe Jim shark website actually builtkind of before Jim shark was properlyfounded here you can see they wereselling supplements but they're alsoselling clothing this was not Jim sharkclothing at this stage pretty poorlooking website but then this was 2011so this was kind of dur ago it'sactually not a bad looking siteconsidering the age but very simple thisis the very early days of Jim sharkso by 2012 this was the Jim shark sitethey'd completely rebuilt it and we'reselling just clothing at this point sodifferent brands of clothing we can seethat Jim shark was just one of thebrands that they were selling as well asthese other companies too we can alsosee from this that the influencersstarted to take center stage so right onthe home screen here we go we've gotpictures of recognized Fitnessinfluences actually we're notnecessarily even seeing pictures of Jimshark clothing here we're seeinginfluences and this starts a bit of atrend with Jim shark where they'reactually focusing more on theinfluencers and the brand ambassadorsthan they are on their clothing now Jimsharks troubles with their websiteparticularly in the early years are verywell documented any business that growsrapidly is inevitably gonna suffer fromsome kind of bandwidth issue with theirwebsite and Jim shark was no exceptionthe first version of the site was builton Shopify they then moved over toMagento in 2013 before then later movingback to Shopify but the Magento sitefrom 2013 this was the look and feelhere now this is quite interestingbecause this is much more kind oftraditional e-commerce layout at thatpoint we're starting to focus more onthe product here and you can see they'reputting more attention behind the Jimshark brand this is what's beingfeatured most heavily also interestinglythe product images here they don'tfeature any people at all these arealmost like the sample images that theywould have had from the brand very kindof corporate looking to me this is abusiness that wants to look bigger thanit is the site is built with very strongconsideration for mobile usability whichis quite forward-thinking of the companythey clearly understood that theirtarget audience was using phones a lotand they built this into the sitewas today mobile first e-commercewebsite is absolute derogaback in these days that wasn't the caseat all by 2014 this was how the sitelooked so we're going more back towardsusing some influences in the imageswe've got much better productphotography this is a much moreaccomplished website that this site tooka long time to build and by the time isactually finished they'd alreadyoutgrown it but we see here a real stepup insights now what we're reallylooking at is we're looking at abusiness that this stage is really onlytwo years old and they've already hadfour versions of their website thisshows how much they understood theimportance of the website and the factthat they're relentlessly focusing onimproving it and making it better we seefor the first time the use of kind of onbrand slogan so challenge your limitsthe future of fitness where and we seethe gym shark more iconic logo beingused throughout other than in the headerinterestingly what we're seeing is abrand evolving and becoming moreconfident in where it's going as itshould do because like this stage thecompany was already very successful now2015 saw yet another iteration of thesite this one again kind of goingfullscreen very mobile focused this kindof layout this image looks like it wasprobably taken on the industrial parkoutside the office in Solihull he looksa bit cold but at this point this wasfrom November 2015 and November 2015 wasa very important time I'd imaginethere's probably some PTSD from thistime inside Jim shark because this wasBlack Friday 2015 where the site crashedduring the peak traffic times now duringthe crash they lost an estimated hundredand forty three thousand dollars andthis was a real turning point for thecompany because it was the first timethat they actually suffered a bit of abacklash from their fans but they cameout from it stronger with been writingwhat's reported to be thousands ofhandwritten apology notes out to peoplethey sent out voucher codes and reallywhilst the website crashing because thedemand feels really bad at the timeobviously when you go down to Asda onBlack Friday only seeing peoplebattering each other over the head toget TVs you get that physical sense ofdemand whereas with an e-commerce siteyou might not get that sense well forJim shark may deafgot that sense because the site wascrashing and product was selling out sothe people in the gym shark audience cansee that do you know what this is reallypopular and that conditions them infuture to be very very fast when they'repurchasing because they don't know howlong the site's gonna last they don'tknow if the product is gonna sell out sowhilst it's considered a kind ofnegative point for Jim shark I'dactually consider that these sorts ofthings these stories that the brand cantell its audience about how fast it'sgrowing actually really useful nowmoving on yet again to 2016 and 2017 thebrand moved back to Shopify this timeusing the Shopify plus platform it'svery clear that they were working veryclosely with Shopify Shopify isextremely proud of the fact that theyhost Jim shark on their Shopify Plusplatform we can see that the site fromthis time has gone back to focusing veryvery much on the influences here we seea couple of their influences nowambassadors wearing the Jim sharkclothes you know yes you can see theirclothes but really these images are allabout the influences we also see thestart of modern Jim shark brand colorscheme so lots and lots of greatbackgrounds a lot of the clothings ingreys and blacks as well and really alot of these images are kind of theprecursors of what we see today's Jimshark site so fast forward to today wesee a very modern Fitness brand theproduct images are stunning all usingvery consistent image style we've gotthe gray backgrounds everything isreally nicely lit they clearly spend alot of time and energy on getting theseproducts images right now in order tounderstand a little bit more about Jimsharks product image strategy and alsohow they use different types of productimages and different locations aroundthe world I spoke recently to daisypaula looking at the old images of Jimshark and new images of Jim shark whatdo you think they've learned in that sixyears that people matteryou know I I've known Jim shark fromInstagram right and everybody in a wayis kind of where's Jim shark but I knowthat from Instagram and I know anInstagram they've always been imagefocused and in flowto focus the cutter they have had a verygood influence of program and brand repsand so forth and so on and so but I hadactually never been to their site andseeing their old product photos on theirsite it's just like it's basically themock-ups that come from the manufacturerwhen you're actually picking your newreleases for example they look just likethis it's just basically theillustrations and and and oh my god itdoesn't sell I think what really soldthem was Instagram I think that reallyadded personality and personified theirbrandI'd emanate for sure because this didn'tdo it at all and and now I love the factthat they've they've really stepped uptheir game and they've got some you knowmodels that know how to show thegarments they've got a personalitythey've got a look to them and andthat's everything and they've got thedepth of field and the background so youknow it's a real set they've got realfitness models so they really focused inon who their demo is it's definitely theLA culture and I don't know if all theirselves come from Los Angeles but youknow these are definitely like la modelsand they've got the LA look and and thelifestyle that you're around summerlifestyle you know and it's it's reallyfantastic and they've got even theaccessories so the props to lift someweights on your shoot I'm looking atthis one guy who's doing some exerciseslike there's some some dumbbells andthat's really great um yeah I thinkthey've come a long way yeah definitelythat's really interesting I've justrealized because I'm like when I saidwhen I look at that link I was likewhere are the props where's the fieldbecause I'm seeing the UK ones they'vegot different product images for UK andUS LA different product images yeah yeahthey do um so they're doing exactly whatyou say they've really understood theirtarget audience they're giving theirgivingimages of people the British and newimages of people that are the SunGillian's yes yes they are yeah they areand you know Fitness is a huge lifestylehere and Wowand they even used a plus-size guy thisis fantasticum I'll probably have to screenshot thisto you but they used um plus-sized malemodel in a fitness outfit and I thinkthey learned a lot from from likefashion OVA and from all the femaledirect to consumer brands where they arereally embracing plus size and bodypositive positive body positivity iswhat we're calling it here and and notairbrushing out the stretch marks orrolls or things like that and they'vegot this male model here and and he'syou know they've showed they're showinghis stretch marks they're showing himwho he is and I think that is soimportant to you know the wholeconversation of inclusivity anddiversity and and you know especially inads and advertising and marketing andmedia and stuff it's a huge conversationhere so that's really impressive love itso you'll take on the 2012 2013 Jimshark images is that they're probablyselling despite these product photosrather than because of them yeah I thinkthey were selling because of Instagramhonestly and they've got some reallygood from the beginning from day onethey had some really good fitnessinfluencers that were really committedto the brand and one of them I know wastalking speaking about in the beginninghow and she the she had started justaround the time that Jim shark had alsolaunched and she said that in thebeginning she was doing a lot of likebooty photos like you know basicallyshowing her butt towards the camera andand and her demographic was majority menand she's like known as the queen oflike a home fitness like home workoutsand on Instagram and and she had tochange her image to really get morefemales to follow her and engage withher and and I think that had a lot to dowith my guesses it had a lot to do withher also her leadership with Jim sharkand being able to sell Fitness leggingsthat made women look good over Instagramso I think there's the I'm reallyimpressed with with that awesome yesinteresting isn't it that when you goI'm just looking at the luxe hoodie andthe luxe bottoms which some of theirbreakout products right in the earlydays and you're right all of the imagesof those products on Instagram werepictures of the influencers wearing thembut then you get to the website andthere's no influencers to be seen itdoesn't make any sense it's like thething is working they haven't taken ontothe website whereas nowadays you go onthe site and it's all the same isn't itit's all consistent the product imageson the gym shark site now are basicallyI mean even down to the color scheme andpalette they're pretty much what you'dexpect to see on the gym shark Instagramchannel it's all really consistent yeahyou know what I think this really says Ithink in the beginning you know startinga brand you're really like fly-by-nightand you're doing so many things and ittakes a lot of thoughts in time and andsystems to get a brand to what we seeJim shark to be today and back then in2012 I think they were just like kind ofswinging it against the wall and andtrying to figure it out and juststarting right and so a lot of timeslike to tell people just it doesn't worknecessarily working the economics of mybest interest when I tell them up juststart but in this case but it's like wowthey it took them a couple years to getit together but they got it together andand it's impressive you know and it'sinspiring it's this is really inspiringto see how far they've come and howconsistent they've got and they've gotthe channels in place and and we knowthey're selling they got it togethervery quickly by 2014 which waskind of two years since it was startedthe sorts of images on the sitedifferent league I'm gonna show youanother example so I've just sent it onskype so this is 2014 so they've now gotmodels in there some of the images onthe header look closer to the source ofthing that they're using today althoughthe products oh yes yes yes they seeyeah yeah Wowyeah and yeah they've got the fitnessmodels yeah so they've yeah Wow Wow yeahthat's man yeah it's a big differencebig difference I just stopped baby-proofquickly yes just start but improvequickly yeah you know that is they don'thang aroundcool awesome Daisy that's amazingone thing that's really interestingthough well if you're a geek like me isJim shark Instagram engagement like manybrand accounts the engagement levels onJim sharks Instagram and nowhere near ashigh as their audience despite the factthey actually have a pretty bigfollowing so here we can see these statsfor Jim sharks main account so we cansee at the time of recording this I'vegot 3.7 million followers which has justhad a massive spike actually which isquite interesting a 1.3 4 % engagementrate on average their posts get around50,000 likes and about 630 comments nowJim shark have other accounts as well sohere's their Jim shark woman's accountwhich has two point four six millionfollowers and again one point seven fourpercent engagement rate so slightlyhigher than the men's one average likesa slightly lower and average commentsare slightly lower so what we're reallyseeing is that Jim shark women accountis about two-thirds the size of the mainaccount and the engagement is abouttwo-thirds the size as well if we take alook at Nikki black out so here's one ofJim sharks main ambassadors she has twomillion followers so fewer followersthan either the Jim shark main or theJim shark woman's account but theengagement rate three point five ninepercent is much higher so this is morethan double both the Jim shark woman'sand the main Jim shock canin terms of engagement rates so we havea much much more engaged audiencedespite a smaller following if we take alook at David laid so he's another Jimstrike ambassador 1.3 million followersengagement rate nine point two percentso like six times what the main Jimshark account gets much much higher manymany more likes as well and loads moreCommons so what we can see here anotherindividual who's got a much higherengagement than the main brand accountfinally Steve Coke two point fivemillion followers who Steve cokesfollowing is actually bigger than theJim shark woman's following engagementweight of three percent so again higherthan both Jim shark and Jim shark womenlikes and comments again completelydestroying what Jim shark itself guessagain we're building up this picture ofthe Jim shark influence as being theones that get the engagement and thenJim shark is essentially collecting allof this audience in one place it's lessengaged because the audience is reallythere for the influences so what we kindof learn from this well like the YouTubelike all the other staff Jim sharkitself has a large audience and thataudience is primarily made up of theaudience's for each of their individualinfluences so if we can extrapolate theengagement that Jim shark gets on thesocial channels as influenced what wesee is actually the individuals are moreinfluential than the company personalbrand still wins for connection weconnect more with people than we do withcompanies and we probably always willand this is why building the brand onthe back of these influencers has beenso vital for their success they needthese influencers to come along keepcontent fresh and to keep people comingback so let's talk about Jim sharksFacebook strategy Sheryl Sandberg thechief operating officer of Facebook onceactually called out in a quarterlyearnings called Jim shark as aparticularly effective user of Facebookads and cited one of their Black Fridayretargeting campaigns as something thatwas generating in 930 percent ROI so weknow that Jim shark uses Facebook adsparticularly around Black Friday now itjust so happens that I'm filming thisvideo in the run-up to Black Friday so Ican show you exactly what they're doingthis year with their Black Friday adcampaign so we can see that thererunning a whole range of different adshere so we can see that these ones forexample running on Instagram we can seethat they also have a whole bunch of adsrunning on Facebook - mostly video adsso we've got this event which they'veset up and then we've got stills from avideo which they've recorded and they'rerunning lots of different variations ofthis in different locations withdifferent audiences the other sorts ofads they're running are ads to their newapp then the app is a really interestingplay for Jim shark it's basically aworkout planner but it's designed to getJim shark fans into the app so the Jimshark can then communicate to them andsend the messages so it's a way oftaking them off the social channelsgetting them in this one place wherethey're going to feed the influencers tothe users because all of the app contentis the influencers and it means that Jimshark then has ownership over that kindof interaction and can send themcommercial messages as well let's talkabout Jim Sharks approach to searchmarketing using my favorite tool Samratwhich you can get a free trial of at aThank You ninjas comwe can see that overall there are threehundred and sixty eight thousandsearches per month in the UK for Jimshark if we have a look at the US we seethat goes up obviously because there's alot more people in the US - five hundredand fifty thousand so three hundred andsixty eight thousand in the UK and fivehundred and fifty thousand in the US nowif we compare this to Nike we can seethat in the UK Nike gets 1 millionsearches per month and in the u.s.obviously Nike gets more searches thanJim shark but wait a secondNikes only getting fewer than threetimes as many searches in the UK as Jimshark is let that sink in for a secNike spends 3.73 billion with ABIdollars a year on ads they've been goinga lot longer they sponsor most of thebiggest sports teams in the worldand in the UK they get three times asmany searches as Jim shark and Jim sharkonly does jim clothingwhoa mama if we look at a legacysportswear brand like Reebok and legacyunfortunately these days means no longerrelevantlegacy sportswear brand like Reebok gets90 thousand five hundred searches amonth in the UK so Jim shark is spankingthem into the ground if we have a lookat Puma similar story Jim shark isgetting more than three times as manysearches per month as Pima this is crazythis company is seven years old what andwe see if we look at Google Trends thatJim shark stock is rising so the companywas founded in 2012 things reallystarted to get interestingafter that trade show you can see thesteady rise through 2013-2014they've always been peaking around BlackFriday because that's when they get amost attention all of this will bepeople who already know Jim shark whoare looking for the Black Friday sale wecan see another peak again in 2016 andagain in 2017 and a huge peak in 2018 wehad a peak in the summer in the UK we'rejust about to hit Black Friday in at thetime of filming this and we're gonna seeanother peak again which will probablyoutstrip the peak from 2018 so we cansee the interest in Jim shark is risingif we have a look at the differentcountries where there's most interest wesee that Norway is topping the listpossibly unsurprisingly Ireland hasn'tbeen contingent a lot of the pop-upshops will be in places like Dublin andin fact actually if we switch this tocities this is really interestingbecause we actually see that the mostinterest for Jim shark tends to happenin cities where there has been a pop upshop so either they put the popups inthe place where they knew they weregetting the most searches or having apop-up increases the number of searchesin that city so ok lots of people aresearching for Jim shark Howard Jim sharkcapitalizing on all of this searchvolume well as an absolute SEO key I'vebeen following Jim sharksrankings for quite a while and what weused to see was that they'd be rankingwell for what we call branded term sopeople searching for Jim shark obviouslyJim shark leggings obviously you knowthe site is going to rank for that thistable allows us to see which phrases Jimshark is ranking for and if we have alook at the different terms that Jimshark is ranking for we see that a lotof these are Jim shark phrases but whatI'm going to do is I'm actually justgonna set up a filter which is gonnatake out any phrases that include Jimshark because we'd expect your mark torank for Jim shark phrases and whatwe're gonna do instead is we're gonnaanalyze how Jim shark is ranking fornon-branded phrases so this all looks abit horrendous if you're not used to itbut let me just talk through exactlywhat we're seeing down here on the Leftwe can see the different keyword thatthe site is ranking for so if someonesearches for example flex leggings onGoogle that's where that comes fromthat's a keyword we can see next columnis the position they're ranking soposition one means you're top of pageone on google so you type it in it'sright there position eight would be 8thon page 1 position 11th would be firston page 2 still with me next up we seekeyword search volume so this is howmany times this phrase is searched permonth so in this phrase here we've gotthe keyword Jim booty shorts I know I'vesearched for that many times positionone so it's top of Google that phraseson average searched 140 times per monthand then this column tells us how muchadvertisers are willing to spend toadvertise against that phrase so this isa really interesting column because itgives us an indication of commercialintent usually a phrase that has a highcost per click means that advertisersare willing to spend more for thatphrase because the people who aresearching for that are going to be moreprofitable for them so for example wewould expect to see a higher cost perclick for example on a workout jacketthan workout t-shirt because a workoutt-shirt is going to be cheaper sothere's less money to be made whereas ajacket is more expensive so usually moreprofitable so people would typicallyspend more to advertise for that wellwhat we learned from this is that Jimsharks rankings have gone beyond justJim shark phrases there now ranking forall sorts of things workout hoodiesribbon crop tops best workout tanks sothese are what we call generic termsbecause there's no brand attached tothem and they're all got commercialintent this is people that are usuallylooking to buy workout t-shirts workoutjackets men's tanks BCAA or creatinewe'll come back to this one in just aminute so we can see that there are lotsand lots of different useful phrases forgym shark here so we can see that thesite is ranking for lots of useful termshere these are all relevant to gym sharkand this is likely going to be bringingthem in a lot of unbranded traffic so wecan see that gyms ranking pretty wellfor a lot of unbranded Gym related termsthat have commercial intent so what dowe mean by that we mean unbranded as inpeople aren't looking for gym shark theydon't have a brand attached to theirsearch yet so their great potential gymshark customerscommercial intent means that usuallythey're looking to buy and theirrelevance they're actually looking forthe sorts of things that gym chartressells this is evidence that gym sharkhas improved its SEO where the act Eshaintentionally but they're actually doingpretty well here and a best opportunityfor gym shark now to expand theiraudience outside people that alreadyknow the company is to rank for thesegeneric terms so over time I'd love tosee gym shark ranking number one forstuff like women's leggings I thinkthat'd be a massive play for thembecause it would bring visibility to awhole bunch of people that don't go intoa gym even but I like oh these are coolI'm gonna get them and then we can startto expand outside the gym now I promisedyou we'd come back to the BCAA andglutamine thing in just a second and I'mnot one to tea so let's have a look atwhat's going on hereso BCAA and glutamine are both workoutsupplements and if we have a look at thepage that is ranking on the gym sharkweb site for this search term we can seethey've got this blog post which iscomparing BCA a versus glutamine someonea gym shark has written this postthey've researched it and put it on thegym shark website why would they do thatthey don't sell either of thesesupplements well the reason that theywould do this is because somebody who issearching for BCA a versus glutamine issomeone who is very serious aboutworking outbut they don't know everything thatthere is to know in other words they'rea perfect gym shark customer they mightbe at the start of their fitness journeybut they're starting to take things abit more seriously so Jim sharks playhere will be to get these people ontothe site because if you're on the siteyou're a relevant potential customer forJim shark and then get them through ontothe Jim shark website so they can startlooking and purchasing now Jim shark isalso pixel in every single visitor thatcomes to this page using the Facebookpixel so this means that they can thenrun ads to you later on on Facebook sothey're basically building an audienceof people that are coming to these blogposts and if they choose to they can runads against that audience so theybasically now know that I go to the gymand I'm interested in this stuff so theycan run ads to me and that's much betterthan just running out to the generalpopulation who might not even be arelevant audience for them so why is theJim shark site ranking so well well ifwe have a look at one of their pages forexample this workout hoodies page justas an example one of the reasons why thesite will be ranking so well is thatactually it's pretty easy to use andit's got some fairly good content yousee even though this is a commercialpage this is for people that are wantingto look at hoodies they've still got abit of text here saying men's Jimhoodies and then they've got a bit ofinformation here about how it all workswith links through to some productcategory pages this really helps to giveGoogle an indication about what thispage is about which is gonna helpranking another part of the reason thatJim shark site is ranking so well it'sgoing to be their link profile now whenGoogle is deciding which website to rankone of the things that looks at is thelinks pointing at that site and linksare kind of its measure of Authority sowe use this tool called the linkExplorer from Moz and it just allows usto have a look at the different linkspointing at the Jim shark website sohere are the different links pointing atthe Jim shark site we can see thatthere's lots of links from YouTube fromJim sharks different influences we cansee also that there are links from siteslike the BBC talking about Ben's storywe can see this is another link fromYouTube this is from a Nicki black ettervideo Nicki as one of their ambassadorswe can see loads and loads and loads oflinks from YouTube we can see links fromreddit we can see links from lots andlots of links from YouTube and we cansee links from sites like this which isthe independent which is a newspapersite basically Jim shark gets threedifferent types of links the first typeof links are from their influence asthis is the biggest number of links thatthey have first type of links is linksfrom their ambassadors and otherinfluences this is the largestpercentage of their total link profileand this is people making a youtubevideo like for example this one whereNikki's talking about Game of Thrones sonothing related to Jim shark but in hervideo description she defaults tolinking to her Jim shark shot becauseshe gets an affiliate Commission or shegets some kind of reward for sendingpeople through to the shop so that's thefirst type of link that they get thesecond type of link that they get arelinks like this where it's round upswhere they're featuring Jim sharkproducts so these are really good andthese are picked up I suspect these areprobably picked up organically thesecompanies the writers that write thesepieces will pick up and link to Jimshark because they already know aboutJim shark there is a chance that they'redoing some kind of paid promotion but Ithink probably at this stage is unlikelyand then the third type of links arelinks like this so this is all aboutbeen about the story of Jim shark andabout their growth and they are pickingup a lot of links from this type ofthing now that the Jim shark story is areal thing and it's got its own tractionit's a kind of perpetuating cyclebecause the bigger Jim shark gets themore people write about them which helpsthem get bigger which helps more peoplewrite about it and it kind of cycles andcycles so are they doing any SEO nowbecause they're getting so many of allthree of these different types of linksI think it's unlikely that they'repaying to do any kind of link buildingwork and even if they are paints do anykind of link building work it's probablyhaving a negligible impact because theamount of links that they're picking upnaturally is so high so what aboutGoogle Ads well you notice that when youtype something into Google for examplehere I've just typed shoulder workoutsyou'll sometimes see advertscoming up for example this one here fromJim shark hot um why is Jim sharkadvertising against shoulder workoutswe'll come back to that in a second nowdoing a bit of research into Jim sharksGoogle Ads just gives us a really clearindication of how much they want her ownthe influences that they work with sowe're just gonna head over to the US fora second and on this screen we're havinga look at the Google ads that Jim sharkis running in the US so we can see thedifferent keywords that they'readvertising against so for examplehoodies for men we can see where thatadvert is being shown and if we hoverover this we can actually see the adthat they are running as well but we'renot gonna worry about that too much whatwe're really looking at now is whatsorts of phrases what keywords are theytargeting with their ads so we can seethat actually they're being pretty boldhere a phrase like hoodies for men is apotentially dangerous phrase to betargeting because just cuz I'm lookingfor a hoodie doesn't mean I'm like a gymgoer it doesn't mean I'm looking for agym hoodie this shows to me the level ofaggression and confidence that Jim sharkis pushing forward with if they'rewilling to advertise for such a genericterm like that which has a huge searchvolume so a hundred and ten thousandsearches a month and healthy cost perclick so they're probably spending 20 30grand a month just targeting that phrasebut they might not even convert thesepeople into customers if they're notlooking for gym stuff it shows twothings to me firstly it shows confidencebut secondly it shows me how much Jimshark is willing to spend to acquire anew customer because why suspect ishappening is that once someone comesinto the gym shark world and they enterinto the portal they buy their firstpiece of clothing they then see all theads they then become familiar with allthe influences that Jim shark has andthey get kind of sucked into this worldand become a bit of an advocate thatperson is then really profitable to Jimshark over time so they're willing toinvest and go quite outside the box andfairly broad in order to get new peoplecoming along either that or they justreally trigger-happy with their Googleads but the other thing that's reallyinteresting is going back to theseinfluences so here we can see themadvertising for phrases like Demi BagbyWhitney Simmons David laid theiradvertising against Nickblack cutter their advertising and SteveKirk what's going on here in the u.s.when you search for Steve Kirk Nikkiblack out David laidWhitney Simmons who do you seeadvertising it's not these people it'sJim shark well they want you to come tothe Jim shark web site and what they'vedone is they've got individual pages foreach of their athletes which allows themto either run ads to these pages or whatthey're really trying to do is get thesepages ranking so that when you searchfor Robin gallon you come to Robin'spage on the Jim shark website and ofcourse when they come to the page theysee all the pictures of these people inthe Jim shark clothing and now they'vegot you on the site that and they canpush you through to their product pagesthe influencers are the brand okay soback over to the UK for a second becauseI want to show you something else notonly are they targeting the broadestpossible phrases like sportswear men'sshorts sports clothing which are supersuper broad but we're also starting tosee a new strategy come through wherethey're actually targeting phrases likeshoulder workout back exercises shoulderexercises back workouts chest exerciseswhat are they doing here well if we headover and have a look if we type inshoulder workouts what do we getwell we get to the gym shark cage wherethey're gonna give us some shoulderworkouts and of course we've gotinfluencers here wearing Jim sharkclothing so why are they doing this wellthey're pixel everyone who comes to thissite which means the website is droppinga cookie on my computer now so that Jimshark knows I'm interested in shoulderworkouts I've come onto the site andthey can now run Facebook ads and Googleads or whatever ads they want to run tome because they've pixeled me so that iswhy I suspect they're doing this thingbecause actually they're not trying thathard to get me through to product pageson the gym shark web site all they'rereally trying to do is get me on thesite in the first place which makes methink that they're probably picksselling me so that they can then run outto me knowing that I'm a gym goer andtherefore I'm a qualified potential gymshark customer it's bold its aggressiveand I love it so those are the mainchannels that Jim shark is usingobviously there's other stuff going onwe've got things like snapchild we've got Pinterest we've gotemail marketing I didn't have time tocover absolutely everything in thisvideo you've been watching along enoughit's about time you went to the gym butbefore we go I wanted to talk aboutfuture growth opportunities you see Jimshark is getting to a point now whereit's size and the speed of growth isactually pretty unprecedented in a brandthat's focusing purely on one particularsport ie going to the gym we can see Jimshark reaching further into this marketby doing things like bringing out theworkout SAP so what are they doing nowwell they're trying to collect anybodywho's interested in going to the gyminto an app so that they can advertisethem or just basically slowlyindoctrinate them into the gym sharkworld of influences we also see themmoving further into their influencesaudiences by doing things like runningthese public playlist on Spotify whereyou find your favorite influencer andthere's their playlist on Spotify so youcan listen to the same music thatthey're listening to you as well onething that I think will be reallyinteresting for them is moving intoinfluences that aren't just pure fitnessinfluences so here we see themsponsoring an influencer called sensornow he's a Call of Duty game outinitially but obviously is transitionedinto the world of fitness and I thinkthis is really interesting because for alot of people now Fitness isn'tnecessarily their main interest a lot ofthis kind of younger generation actuallyFitness is just like the operatingsystem for life is just one of thedefault interests that everybody has andthey overlay their personality on top ofthat so here we can see a guy that maybethey wouldn't have traditionally goneafter he's in good shape but he's notlike the other influences that Jim orshark has which are just pure fitnesshe's got a large gaming audience so Iwonder if this is Jim shark trying toreach into the gaming audience realizingthat actually they're kind of runningout of pure Fitness influences that havethis sort of size audience that theycould really go after now there is apotential vulnerability although I'm notsure it's right to call it avulnerability which is basically whatwe've seen throughout which is Jim sharkis so reliant on its influencers tobring in new audience members thatactually if something significant wereto change between the brand influence arelationship for exampleyou know we saw legislation come inrecently which required influences tolabel their posters ads if some crazylegislation came in that saidinfluencers weren't allowed to work withbrands or something you know totallyridiculous like thatJim shark could potentially be introuble obviously that's a very verysmall percentage chance and I think alsoJim shark has broadened its influence abase out so that it's not reliant onanyone or two or even a group ofparticular people and of course they'realways going to be new influencerscoming through in the scene butnevertheless the risks are there ifthese influences start clubbing togetherto build their own brand or you knowthere's a story that leaks aboutwidespread steroid usage or somethinglike this which damages the clean-cutperception of Jim shark there arevulnerabilities in this pure influencermarketing strategy because at the end ofthe day they don't control those assetsbut obviously this takes nothing awayfrom what an incredible great story theJim shark journey has been up to now onething I think we'll see Jim shark doingmore of is tapping into influences thataren't just in the fitness space formany people particularly in the youngergeneration coming up there Fitness isn'tlike their whole identity is just partof the operating system of their lifeand they then have other interests whichthey kind of overlay and consider to betheir primary interests so Jim sharkwork with a guy called sensor who isreally he's a Call of Duty gamer whokind of moved a bit further into thefitness industry so I think this isreally interesting because obviouslythey're working with him because he hasa large audience that audience isn'tprimarily there to follow him forfitness reasons they're there to followhim for gaming reasons but I think thiscould be a really interesting angle thatJim shark take tapping into influencesthat have a big audience outside offitnesswhen Fitness is only one of the thingsthat person is known for and I guessthat's one of the challenges Jim sharkis gonna face as it continues to growand as it tries to maintain this insanelevel of growth it's actually gonna runout of influences in the fitness spaceso what about vulnerabilities to thisway of growing well asseen Jim shark does the best when itputs the influences front and centerwhen it tries to go front and centeritself it finds it a little bit harderto get traction isn't necessarily anissue as long as there's always a steadystream of influences to come through andessentially be the face of the brandwhere this could potentially be an issueis if the nature of the influencer brandrelationship changes for some reason soin the grand scheme of things influencesare a fairly new thing we saw how addinga hashtag ad was brought in byauthorities that kind of make theirbrand influence a relationship a littlebit better known if there was some otherpiece of legislation or rule that camein either required influencers tospecifically state their commercialrelationship with the brand orpotentially even stopped working withbrands right which would be obviouslyreally extremely extremely unlikely butsomething like that could interfere withJim sharks growth model so far othervulnerabilities would be you know groupsof influencers combining to start theirown brands instead or potentially somekind of scandal which comes throughoutthe influencer industry there'ssomething about steroid usage orsomething like that I mean all of thesethings are fairly unlikely to disruptthe Jim shark brand but it's just partof that vulnerability that you have whenyou don't fully own those marketingassets as they are obviously none ofthis is to take away Jim sharks insanegrowth this has been like I said rightat the start this has been one of themost incredible growth stories of ourgeneration and all of this that's showedthat Jim shark is not done yet there'splenty more growth to be hadokay key takeaways what can we learnwhatever we sell from the Jim sharkstory first thing is that people canlook at the Jim shark story and say ohyeah it's all influence and marketingand they just that's all they really didwell it's not technically true I meanthe main thing that I think Jim sharkhave got really right consistently isproduct market fit sorry that was a bitDavid bream wasn't it they understandtheir target audience really well andthey understand their products reallywell and they build stuff that they knowthat target audienceis really gonna like synergy you can'tout market a bad product or non-existentdemand let me say that again you can'tout market a bad product on nonexistentdemand you have to have something thatpeople want and you have to sell it tothe people that want itJim sharks product isn't revolutionaryby any means but it is something thatpeople need you need to wear clothes inthe gym boring right but you need to andwhat about the lessons for Jim sharksown influence and marketing work whichreally has kind of redefined the spacewell we've seen how Jim shark doesn'tsell its product and attach influencesJim shark actually takes the oppositeapproach and basically just collects theinfluencers and then sells theinfluencers back to their audiences withproducts attached it's the completeopposite approach as I was researchingthis I was trying to work out why is itthat so few consumer facing brands thatwork with influencers haven't taken thisapproach to give the influence of somuch power and I think really it comesdown to fear fear that giving theinfluencers too much power will overempower them so they go and start theirown brands and do other things anddemand more money and probably also fearof not owning that brand to fanrelationship Jim shark is essentiallystanding in the background while SteveKirk sells Jim shark to his fans and ifyou're not confident in the power of thebrand and your relationship with thatinfluencer that's a really risky thingto do but if I had to sum up Jim sharksuccess story so farI'd like to sum it up with this whichI'll end on this is something posted bya 19 year old personal trainer on mediumthis guy's called Adam peeler weightnineteen-year-oldinto fitness we've come full-circlethat's been Francis now Adam write thison medium despite having no connectionto Jim shark and to me it's HIPAA Phi'sthe place that Jim shark holds in itsfollowers hearts let me get a drinkbefore I read this oneI stumbled across Jim shark because Ilike their clothes that was it I thoughtthey look cool and I wanted to have themsince then it's going to be more thanthat it's going to be how I live my lifelike a visionary I wake up every day nowwith purpose and meaning and drive to dothings differently and become betterwhat I do and create the type of life Iwant to live it has become part of myidentity when I wear a shirt from Jimshark I'm telling myself and others I'mdifferent I'm gonna change the worldsomeday that's powerful that'smotivating and guess what it's exactlywhat I plan to do we all have abilitieswe all have potential the fact of thematter is that you have to work for ityou have to do things outside of the boxsometimes and be okay with being weirdfor a little bit to meet any brand thatcan motivate such emotion from theirtarget audience they're really ontosomething you heard it

becauseyou guys seem to appreciate the sizingand things like that to help you get theright things because we know thesethings real quickly when they do comeonline so today we're going to be takinga look at the new release ascendantshorts as you remember they're releasedlike a football jersey a while ago theseare the shorts to go with that thefootball jersey was like a yellow withgray so I thought I'd start with showingyou what the old looks rostro is showingyou'll be familiar with now these areactually a size large you can see thesesort of the original line so these arethe soft cotton and I mean they're tightthat's my leg there I mean there's notmuch in that large stretch is OK on themand we're going to compare now so if youtake a look at that that's kind of likethat so they come to the cup just abovethe kneewhich would people like me such a littlebit because I got such tangled joints itit makes me takes away all the sides allmy leg sizes up here a leg update noto the side getting that nice detailsare all still there from the cup justkind of maintaining my level in thiscutting out and you can see all my legsize comes right off topic here so I'mworking on improving ta job levels butinsertions are insertionsthere's no point where invalidso here we have them we're looking atfive different variation colors of thisrelease I'm gonna go through exactlylike I've done with all your reviewswhat they made of how they look and howthey fit so we're going to look at theblack neon orange black neon blue blackneon green and then there's the bluewith the white and what I'm currentlyrocking there we go the gray with neonyellow or yellow so you can see whatthey are is 100% polyester creativelightweight breathable design so fittingfitting with all the new releases whichare all lightweight breathable fitnessorientated web now this interestingthing here is these are a medium now Iwant to show you beforewhat's the looks is in a large so youcan see the sizing this come much morein line with European fit now so what Iwould say is if you're a large if itlooks you're going to be a medium inthese slight higher cutoff then with thelock test as you can see which is alittle better because it shows throughthe teardrop muscle I would say I couldget away with these in a small if Ireally really wanted to because pullingthem up you can see that they do stretchover the quad quite easily a nicebecause they've got a micro mesh splitdown the side here which opens up as itcomes down and if I was wearing a smallI'd be able to sit them a little higheron the quad and they would stay therebut with these mediums when I'm movingthey're going to sit down more they'rewearing my normal waist tight if I dropthem lower that's where they go butthey're really nice movement range ofmovement completely flexible likefootball short should be football rugbyshorts flexible they are quite a littlebit of give in the material not aroundthe seams though but there is givingactual body but what allows for thatstretch is the micro mesh down the sizehere so that's going to expand as youmove with it so a nice drawstring in thesame color as the outside detailingwe've got the gym shop logoon the bottom left down there in thesame color as whatever the piping detailis going to be elasticated waist andclassic runner style you've got a littlehidden pocket of the back here which isa zip or fitting and that's for stickingin iPod or whatever where you're runningand it's a lot down zip as well it'lljump shot loger on there so there youhave a really nice comfortablelightweight dare I say you could get itwith a probably swimming in these onholiday I mean there is no swimmerlining inside but they're not going togo see through because they are apolyester so you've got to be prettysafe on that front only thing I wouldsay is if you go to in salt water makesure you rinse them out thoroughlyafterwards because that can naturalmaterial so let's have a look I'm goingto spin through every color so you cansee them I'll raise up this stuff alittle bit and I'll sit on all the sameheight so you can you can have a doubleupand finishing up on the Navy with thewhite detail these are really nice I dolike them I've got to say they're veryvery comfortable they're going to feelcompletely moveable and free range ofmotion whatever you're doingyeah really really nice so you've gotevery every color learner you think ofhere from your neon to the simple navyand white so hope that helps you make adecision I'll give you some close-ups ofsome of the detailing so there we gothat's Jim shot logo on the corner andthat is a nice stretchable over printthere you can see the micro mesh on thesides and that's what's going to allowthat range of movement as well andbreathability internal details are niceJim sharp logo and sizing on the insidesmatching clothes drawstring should youwant to wear it outand again zip is complementary to thestyling color that you're going to pickwith that lock down zip that's a usefulcompartment I would say I mean it's notgoing to be big enough it's not going tobe enough to fit an iphone six-plusreally in there but it is definitelygoing to taking normal regular size iPodobviously just used as a money pocket soI hope that's been used to you guys sizemediumI wore a size large in the looks is sothese are much more in fitting withEuropean sizing I am as a standard I'm 5foot in half five foot nine and reducewarlord everything that week and I havea 29 inch waist 44-inch chest I don'tactually know what size they are butthey're black that all my thickness isall for the top and the back here so youcan see it stretches over myquite really nicely and then I would sayif you had it over a good one is nicebra teardrops hanging over your kneethese were sit quite nice just over thatit's not going to give you any chafingor anything like it's because becausethat flexibility on the mesh so you canbe absolutely fine so it's all going tobe about where you want these to sit andwhat your waist size is so me being a 29I could Rob these in a medium Idefinitely think I could get in as smallif I wanted them to sit a touch higherand be more of a tight fit for maybe notall

never too latewhat's up YouTube and welcome to anotherultimate review as you can see we arenot at home I'm doing this from a hotelroom in LA that is how much dedication Ihave to your requests because I knowthis helps you guys and I really want toget these review things back on track soalso let me know in the description whatyou would like saw in the comments whatelse you'd like me to go throughanything and everything and we'll startcreating a whole nice little series foryou guys to have in a nice backlog soyou can go and check through but forthis one we're back with a new gym shotrelease which is going to be going ononce you watch this video they will beout and there are four new items we lookat today we have two hoodies and twoversions of a brand new top which iscalled the elevate and this one isdesigned for the fitness community in awhole it looks like it's going to begood for running lifting and justanything generally where you're going tobe needing that kind of breathabilityand wick away there are a lot of peoplelike with a stretch fit so withoutfurther ado let's move onto the first oftwo hoodies it's one you're going torecognize but it is a revamp and that isthe Tri panel hoodie it's gonna come inthis awesomegrey on grey on black and check it outwe've got a few new updates to thesehoodies as you see we've got thelockdownzips with the gym shark logo on therewe've got the beer visionary nice littletouches here there and everywhere we'vegot a double layered hood with a threepanel design on it which means it'sgoing to sit a little squarer than youones with a single the jus banner wallstend to sit with more appoint these sitwith more square fit so it's good foryou guys with larger domesthen we've got the tribe panel cut sowe've got a single huge cross panelcoming to this arm and then anotherpanel coming off for the left arm andthen the body is one whole single colorturn off on the back you can see thenagain some nice back detailing going onI'm going to get this one on in a sizemedium as you know guys as a rule I tendto be a 42 inch chest I have a 30 inchwaist I am 5 foot 8and I tend to wear a large and mostthings on top unless it's a stretch fitbecause I'm a medium fit around mymidsection the reason I'm a large lot ofthings is mainly because on my shouldersmy shoulders take up quite a lot of roomin the material in the shoulder regionsif it's not a Raglan sleeve fit meaningthere's not seem coming across theshoulder that means that the materialwill stretch much better over theshoulders and allow expansion if there'sa seam running what that does is itpulls the seam up which lifts the hem soI'm often a large when I dive a Raglansleeve fit so putting this on you cansee it's a medium I wear it as a mediumbecause of this one simple reason it'snow stretch over it fits really nice onthe arms in a medium and the length onthe body is just about rightso you can see it sits here now if I wasto go up to a large what that would dowill give me a little bit more armlength a little bit more width in thearm here and touch more body length anda little bit more width here so if youwant to tape it fit on these at 5/8really this medium fits very very welland even though this would appear to bea Raglan cut there is actually a seamrunning across here but with it being aslight stretch material it seems to fitme fine this one is obviously fresh andhasn't been washed yet so if you likeyour items to be a little bit of a morecomfort fit definitely go with a largeif you normally are a large but you willpossibly as long as you're not over kindof 5 foot 9 5 10 you may well get awaywith a medium on this being fittedalthough you're going to have to becareful washing it and make sure you hita 30 degree cool wash and then air dryit do not put these in a dryer taking alook at the insides of these you'regoing to see they are fleece lined whichis going to make them soft but alsogoing to make them quite a nice warm upgarment hood up you can see what I'mtalking abouthas that much more kind of a square lookand it's not too deep there's quite ashallow back on the head nice littledetails on the drawstrings capped off soyou don't get any of that flaring fromit being a knotted tie they're sealedand it's not a wax which is going tobreak down that's a hard plastic cap onthe end jewel shop logo stitchedembroidered on thereover the chest and we have some openfront pockets which are nice and roomyand sit pretty well last Decatur hemwhich is ribbed so that's going to helpgrip keep it downsame goes for the cuffs you decide nowtake a look at new one which is thefrontier is going to be basically theexact same fit as this but obviouslywe're going to have a different style inthe way it looks so this one's fresh outof the packet so you can take a look athow they come they come with an updatednice gym shot tag with your detailing ontheir size garment and everything likethat so this one's the front to yourhoodie this is class's black and againthis is a medium fit you can see how itdiffers in style to the Tri panel it hasa more of a full body color and then wehave more of a breakdown of the Grays onthe arm and this includes white blackand red coloration everything is goingto fit pretty much identical but you aregoing to have other seams across thearms now you've like me you have decentsized arms this seam that runs acrossthe bicep he's going to feel a littlebit tighter but again the whole materialis a flex material so it doesn't seem toit's not uncomfortable in any way butyou are going to feel it a touch if youwant the fitted style now so maybe get apump in the gym him he'll want to be alittle bit wary but other than that it'scomfortable again ribbed cuffs and hemswe've got the cat toggles so you get thethin their issues wise and we've got ablack and white embroidered logo exactsame click down cap Zeeb and herelooking at styling it's pretty cool Ireally like it really nice contrastinghoodies going with a lot of stuff nicecolor variation so you can mix and matchI can just rockin this with the theblack looks bottoms and it looks prettysick now on to the brand new releasewhich is the elevate tops here we golooking at it first in the blue this isthe brand new elevate from Jim shark wehave here reflective and over prin logoon the top this isfrom a breathable light stretch materialyou've got a quarter zip from neck downto chest nice little details when youopen that upJim shark around here and again detailsso everything inside and a nice littletouch over

sheer panel along the baseof the forearm here which then movesthrough into solid but perforatedbreathable material that runs down theside of the ribs and under the arms thisis perfect designed for any kind ofaerobic activity you're going to see aswell when it fits this is a large I alsohave medium to show you and to be ableto differentiate the style how you'regoing to seeso this is a large it's designed to befitted so this is the large and you cansee on the larger have a little bit morelength to play with in the arm so I canpull it up and zip up there we go so youcan see is a very very clean-cut pieceof kit we have that contrastingbreathable area here there is a lot ofnice little touches in panel detailingif you look over the back we have a nicepanel that runs across the back with thelogo which just gives it a nice break upand and that's just pure detail anddesign there's no restriction inmovement at all it's a completelyflexible garment and breathable soactually large also comes in this reallynice grey color again two logos ascontrasting panel detailing on the backandunderneath the breathable material bitmore of a blended color see how muchdarker this one is under here on thisone is much more in keeping with theuniformed body color but this is amedium so here's a large on me you cansee the length of that and we'rechanging now put on the medium of thegreat so there we go that's the mediumon a noticeable thing when putting it onthe difference being is a touch tie iton their arms you can see the arm lengthis slightly shorter and again the bodylength just a little bit shorterprobably by around about half an inch toan inch so it's just a little a littlebit more fittedbut with it being a stretch materialit's an it's comfortable to wear and Ican't see this one changing much shapeduring a washing process again you wantto be careful on anything anything thatyou ever buy always try and washing onthird degree wash and avoid using tumbledryersbecause they will

never too latewhat's up YouTube and welcome to anotherultimate review as you can see we arenot at home I'm doing this from a hotelroom in LA that is how much dedication Ihave to your requests because I knowthis helps you guys and I really want toget these review things back on track soalso let me know in the description whatyou would like saw in the comments whatelse you'd like me to go throughanything and everything and we'll startcreating a whole nice little series foryou guys to have in a nice backlog soyou can go and check through but forthis one we're back with a new gym shotrelease which is going to be going ononce you watch this video they will beout and there are four new items we lookat today we have two hoodies and twoversions of a brand new top which iscalled the elevate and this one isdesigned for the fitness community in awhole it looks like it's going to begood for running lifting and justanything generally where you're going tobe needing that kind of breathabilityand wick away there are a lot of peoplelike with a stretch fit so withoutfurther ado let's move onto the first oftwo hoodies it's one you're going torecognize but it is a revamp and that isthe Tri panel hoodie it's gonna come inthis awesomegrey on grey on black and check it outwe've got a few new updates to thesehoodies as you see we've got thelockdownzips with the gym shark logo on therewe've got the beer visionary nice littletouches here there and everywhere we'vegot a double layered hood with a threepanel design on it which means it'sgoing to sit a little squarer than youones with a single the jus banner wallstend to sit with more appoint these sitwith more square fit so it's good foryou guys with larger domesthen we've got the tribe panel cut sowe've got a single huge cross panelcoming to this arm and then anotherpanel coming off for the left arm andthen the body is one whole single colorturn off on the back you can see thenagain some nice back detailing going onI'm going to get this one on in a sizemedium as you know guys as a rule I tendto be a 42 inch chest I have a 30 inchwaist I am 5 foot 8and I tend to wear a large and mostthings on top unless it's a stretch fitbecause I'm a medium fit around mymidsection the reason I'm a large lot ofthings is mainly because on my shouldersmy shoulders take up quite a lot of roomin the material in the shoulder regionsif it's not a Raglan sleeve fit meaningthere's not seem coming across theshoulder that means that the materialwill stretch much better over theshoulders and allow expansion if there'sa seam running what that does is itpulls the seam up which lifts the hem soI'm often a large when I dive a Raglansleeve fit so putting this on you cansee it's a medium I wear it as a mediumbecause of this one simple reason it'snow stretch over it fits really nice onthe arms in a medium and the length onthe body is just about rightso you can see it sits here now if I wasto go up to a large what that would dowill give me a little bit more armlength a little bit more width in thearm here and touch more body length anda little bit more width here so if youwant to tape it fit on these at 5/8really

oh it's called however it's blackit's extra large it has the same kind oflogo if you can see I'll put some videosover the top anyway it's got the samekind of logo as this hoody this one's alittle bit more blocked in the base linebut it's the same kind of style and yeahthat's all I've got to say about thisone I'm absolutely useless of clothinghalls please don't give this a thumbsdown but yet this one for me personallyis perfect fits very very nice roundarms it's still a little bit baggy butfor me personally I don't like the gymshark style where I think they're calledArk t-shirts where they really hang downfor me that's a no-no but this comes alittle bit short up and they still bagat the bottom so would highly recommendagain if it's available 15-20 poundsabsolutely fantastic for that winterclothing off straight on to elf elitesso if you're a Christian guzmán fanyou'll know all about athletesI haven't actually other than a coupleof t-shirts that I wear wear like awhite and a black one there just sayself elite on there I haven't actuallybought anything else purely because ifI'm honest it's a cost aspect to itobviously gotta pay for shipping whichis all 4 or 5 pounds I think now theymight have introduced where you get freedelivery over like 100 pounds orsomething like thatbut sort of 2 or 3 items that's whatyou're talking about and at the end ofday if you go Jim quite often you andyou want that high kind of end clothingwhere that's what you're gonna have topay at the same time it's not alwaysaffordable which are the end of daythat's what clothing haul should be youdon't be spenthundred hundred pounds on cloves that'llbe incense I have a big big fan of thatof their cloven so the first one ontalked about is we're gonna go with thejog is and I've been wanting to getthese for ages and oh and the one thingwithout fleet as well I always find mylike my size is out of stock if I want aparticular product whereas in the sale Ithink I ordered two of these twodifferent jobs but only one came sothese are the black joggers this is theonly thing that I actually get large ineverything else extra-large purelybecause you want that tapered bottom atthe bottom of your around your anklesfor me I wear the kind of knife lineit's so I want something that's taperedon I want something that's baggy andthese actually fantastic at the sametime has a nice amount of stretch aroundhere to make it very comfortable and nottoo tight fitted I also find if you ifit's too tight fitted around that areadown below it's not a good look it's notgonna look especially if it's chilly sothis is tight in all the right places onto the hoodie so this is the alpha Leehoodie which I've wanted for agesfinally got to the sour think I paid 30pounds for both of these items this isthe I can't remember what this is calledI think this is called alpha Lee hoodieone second this isn't just any hoodiethis is the performance hoodie guesswhat sighs I got that's correct extralarge so this one you probably will seewith the video over the top you mighthave be able to see it now this actuallycomes out slightly to the sides that'snot really gonna help too much but yeahthis is the performance hoodie like thisproduct a lot this is a lot thicker thanthe gym shark ones so that's probablynot ideal if you get really really hotin your sessions because you're justgonna be taken off within the first selltobut again I like the kind of length fromthe arms around the kind of bases thatcomes down as welloverall really really satisfied withthis product so again if it's availablein stock go ahead and purchase it thereason I like persons from not only outfleet because I've only know a few itemsfrom there but mainly Jim shark isbecause I just find the productsthemselves just fit so so nice incomparison to anywhere else I find 9 yes9 houses fit really well anything elseand kind of hoodies as well are a nicefit but anything else is a kind of hitmiss Jim shark I always finds once youpurchase one of the products it justfits really really nicely so that is myclothing haul done all six itemswhoo-hoo fantastic I hope you enjoyedthis video leave a comment down below ifyou want to see more cloven hauls likethis if I'm honest I actually reallyenjoy doing these I like kind of show inexactly what I've bought and what I'drecommend to you guys as well especiallyif you've got like a similar taste tomyself in cloven and like that kind ofsimple aesthetic look I don't see if Icould be of any advice and guidance thenabsolutely fantastic go ahead and smashthat like button right now come on brocomment below if there's any particularvideo you want to see in 2020 commentdown below if you want to see Carly getinvolved in more videos as well thankyou so much for watching I'm gonna stopchatting right now and I'll see youguys in the next one[Music],22,UC_AMy38RCT8bS5SllI886UQ,James Smith,1,0,0,1,No Tags,Gymshark- shoulder smashed!,Ewn2WHaDPfM,236

all right so what we're doing todaywe're doing an upper-body sesh supersetting between agonist antagonistmuscle groups so first we're doing aincline press here then a pull nextmovement were going to be doing more ofa flat type press most likely and avertical pool like a lat pulldown andthen after that we'll be getting intosome arms and things like that so we'vegot a very different warm up than thatvery I just get blood everywhereand I kind of feel that where my jointsare if something feels like I need towarm it up a little bit more the changesday by day for me sometimes so wenormally do more compound lives lessmachines like this but we're at adifferent date in San Francisco it'slike I might as well just fun once youhave like the luxury of doing thesethings more like it's more like kind oflike a playground you know but you gotto love it you either love it or youdon'tone play difference broke it was likethree plays surprisingly challengingthat feels like a actual incline barbellcrowd because like a plate moves likeokay it must be the angle ofgod damn that was not fake 9 maybe wecan do like 2 sets then chooses the dipsand the two sets of that like Charlottewill do anything I consider getting oneof these from him it's basically like amillion different kinds of holes you cando like adjustments you could even likeslide a barbell right here and do liket-bar rows like we're using it we'reusing a Brandon just for you some randomtips for this it's like see a lot ofpeople do it wrong in either one or twoways usually you'll see them punch forit like this or you'll see them go likethat and it's usually somewhere in themiddle I usually keep that slightly backget that upper chest up just drive yourelbows into the back pockets of yourpantspretty much okay straighten up at thetop slightly bring your elbows to yourpocketsnormally say do the same workouts weekto week but sometimes when you're withyour friends you got to go a littlewhile but the benefit is that you don'tstretch all the way downmeaning you don't get the chest asinvolved and you work on one sidestability for the tricep and just triceplockout strength you want to increaselike your bench press or something orjust work the tricep yes with the bandsaround a rig pulling you that way so yousqueeze the bed you want try that thebenefit of that is probably it probablylooks weird doing it with the band butthe purpose is because as you'repressing right the bands kind of pullingyour arm out so it forces you to have togenerate that chest force to bring it inas you come up because if you don't doit if you don't pull inward as you asyou push up the weights gonna pull youout so you're forced to use the chestyou have no other choiceso sometimes those are the things thatyou got a movement in order to just getit done without thinking just force yourbody to do certain things matter I'llcheck this [ __ ] out you remember back inthe dayfor the value they know that is I knowfrom the archives you could probablysell that remember 2013 the kickoff yearmanthe luxe tracksuit but they didn't havethe black I don't think right earlyeveryone in the world was wearing thiseveryone in the world still wants oneyes but those those luxe track actuallydon't even think we start with black alittle bit later yeahyou see let me show you you ready forthis one show the camera show the campthis

crazythis should eight and this is actuallywhen things started getting even alittle bit better I think been Francisminded like to put down himself maybeyeah exactly stylish that's when theystarted doing the embroidery which isalready like a quality like increaseUnited mean you really see there beforeit was just like a heat press and it waslike trick aided stuff like that that'sthough leave it on leave it on some dipsyeahlike like hi rose you wanna be like ohyeah let's let's getlike those those fixed bars right therethe straight ones let me just pull mypants down since my leg games are toomuch for mejimmy shark bring it back man this thingis this is so old-school it looks newschool what is this this just soundslike 2013 it's getting stuck good timesman these memories when you can't lookcheck this out when you take your tagoff and literally stab yourself out I'vedone that multiple times man that's whenyou know you're og like stab wounds fromyour gym shark tag first moment Irealized huge shark was gonna besomething 2013 body power Expo firsttime going to England first time reallythat Jim Stark had any kind of eventwhere they you know they were trying toexpose the brand

was just a reality check you knowright after that week everything justexploded it was just the the ability toconnect the social world social mediaworld like face to face and that wasreally a revolution for any brand doingany kind of you know explosive throughsocial media who was Jim shark who justslammed that first and they sawsomething special and it turned intosomething special so we really do thatJim smart the entire time has onlyreally teamed up with people that Ireally molded well with the brand youhave to enjoy what you dojust like anything lifting weightswatching what you eat

systemthat prevents the lid from opening justrandomly in your bag I really love thatabout it and it's really easy to usejust with one hand you can just open itup like that okaymoving on the next thing that I have isthis makeup bag type of thing and inhere I usually haveI make up remover pads just in case I'dmeet some cheering um tablets and alsoat one or two spare headbands hair bandsyep that's that and but the next thingwould be your drone this is the one thatI currently have in my bag right next Ihave a small towel like face towel typethingy and next I have this for mysupplement and if you would like me totalk about what supplements are using abit more detail then leave me a commentin the comment section down below and Iwill be more than happy to film that foryou the next item in my bag is this gymbox timer and I was really recommend itespecially if you're into hip trainingit is not the cheapest thing but it isquite affordable so yeah I will try andleave a link to it in the descriptionbox down below if you're interested inchecking it outall right I also have a pair of gloves Ido have quite sensitive skin and I dothink to get calluses if I don't wearthem so that's why I

great likebrands for like sports stuff accessoriesand things like that so yeah that's thatnext I have a pair of headphones therewas that on really enjoy using thesesound beeps onesI got them from Amazon recently and awireless they're really comfortable towear and they have three buttons onthere and they allow me to change thesong and volume and everything needsyeah you don't have to constantly reachfor your phone that's why I love themyep the battery on them lasts for aboutfour hours I haven't actually had anyproblems with them so farand again I'll try and find the link tothem if you wanna

actually ordered Jim sharkgear I think overall it took about threeto three and a half weeks maybe beforefor it to get to me just because theyfirst shipped it and then about week anda half into the process they emailed meand told me that they're the carrierthey went with there was just a problemso they sent it back and then they hadto go with a new one and then theyshipped it back out to me and I justtook forever so second time it tookabout two weeks so not too bad which iswhat I expected this time a littlequicker so pretty awesome it's always agood feeling to get a package in themail especially when it is a gym shirtpackage so so yeah let me open this upso you best and see what hideouts in onesecond alright so here they are guysfirst of all you show you this so highgod whoops okay so I got the t-shirt seehere it's the blue blue v-neck t-shirthas the cold gin shark here in thebottom corner right here so I like thecolor I feel like I look best blue sogot that and then the other thing i gotis actually these a pant right here nowthese are the i forget what they'recalled they're the core fit pantsthey're from their new fit series i wantto give a quick shout out to OGaesthetics for recommending thesebecause I never even thought ofthese in the first place and then Ithought well I already have a shirt fromtheir fit series run out the pan so yeahI got these i'll be i don't know aboutthe pants but i'll definitely be one theshirt today when I work out but yeah youguys will see me wear these in futurevideos and I'll let you know how theywork out but they look awesome so i'mway excited but yeah i will see you guysin a little bit all right butI'm just getting ready to go to the gymin a little bit but I do want to showyou guys something this here you go sothis is my workout routine this is a newone so I've been doing the last one whatyou saw in previous videos for a littleover a month now so obviously it's timeto change it up I'm kind of gettingbored with it I'm getting used to iteven though I am upping the weights it'sstill the same exercise and I want tochange them alright guys so here's myworkout although i do want to start thisoff just by showing off my new gym sharkgear and can really only see the shirtthat I ordered which I think it'sawesome if you look there it's it's justlike perfectly shaped at the top so Imean it's very very aesthetic lookingbut in the torso it's a lot looser butnot too much to wear it just looks weirdso yeah that's just me showing it offI'm also wearing those pants as wellwhich are by the way extremelycomfortable but yeah so there's meshowing that stuff off and then well istarted my workout so i started this ismy pulled a i started with some seatedcable rows and a lot of the stuff that Ido I'm going a lot heavier so I did atotal of six sets here the first threewere anywhere from one to five reps areally heavy and then three sets ofeight after that and also you know asalways doing this I try not to rock backand forth too much towards the end of itI did a little bit and that's okay toget up those last few reps but I triedto keep my back as still as possible soi was really isolating the upper backthere but yeah so I did that and thenthat was exercise number one spendlittle timethat next up were some dumbbell benchrose again going heavy three sets of 125and then three sets of six or three setsof eight after that so lightening it upon those last three since this was myfirst workout on this routine I wasmostly just trying to figure out where Ineeded to be as far as weight goes justremember guys as you're doing thisexercise keep that back straight as wellbetter form alright so next I did somesingle arm assisted pullups which is anexercise I really like to do I don't doit a whole lot but when I do get to itit's it can be tough now first when youjump on and actually do it it honestlyseems really light at first but reallyquickly the exercise actually getspretty tough so when you're trying tofigure out the wait for that hang inthere for like a set or two to reallyfigure it out before switching it up ortrying to make it heavier after say oneor two reps if it seems really lightobviously if you're pulling yourself upand basically jumping off that pad thenyeah it's going to be too light alrightguys now exercise is number four andfive as you see here are a superset ofsome cable curls and then cable flexgrills and just remember on the cablecurls keep the arms next to your sidetry not to swing the elbows up too muchand then on the cable flex curls keepthat arm straight out so the upper armparallel with the floor don't drop theelbow down or bring the elbow and closerto the body it'll hit the bicep just alittle better in the next still morebiceps by doing some alternatingdumbbell curls here's a couple angles ofthose but yeah I just really enjoy thisexercise it feels really good I try notto swing too much if I can help it Iusually do right at the end of theset though just get those last few upand then one more bicep exercise somebarbells spider curls and this is reallygreat exercise for hitting the peak ofthe bicep as you can see there againjust try not to swing the elbows for thepoint I actually do this alright so I'malmost done with my workout I am nowdoing a superset of some seated bentover rear lateral raises and somedumbbell hi rose and just make sure thatboth great rear delt exercises just makesure on the hi rose let those elbowsflare out and then you want to pull uptowards shoulder level alright and thenfinally after that I just finished upwith some well on the rear delt machinefinishing up there well thanks forwatching guys that was my new pollroutine as always please subscribe to mychannel so I keep you guys updatedplease like and share these videos

I haven't had someone tie my shoes sincethe second grade I'm not gonna lie itwas the sixth grade[Music][Music]great work[Music]the biggest challenge with Archie usinga gym with a prosthetic limb wasactually using some of the machinery themachinery is designed for of asymmetrical one shape one size personwhereas with it with a missing limbyou're not you're not that so you mightnotice on the deadliest that the firstone I'm in very much on this one sideand that's why they kept moving to oneside but then as I go through the reps Ibuild the confidence in this hip becauseat the end of day I haven't got quadsand hamstrings on this leg it's a fireit's just coming through glutes and hipflexors so it's designed to take weightgo 100 kilograms while I'm not 95 so Iwas like I don't want to squat like ahundred boy whereas this can take up to200 kilograms going through apart fromthese bits I've got little cracks on thebottom from all the deadly oxen kickingso that's tough in a very short space Ijust love the speed the whole art ofmartial arts but I knew without thequestion for me being an Asian femalepetite Bangladeshi be used and I justnearly family would never allow me to dothis I was actually training in secretfor the first five years and I was avery traditional from a very traditionalbackground for me to do this there was abig deal I said for a personal problem Iwas an antidepressant I was sufferingfor panic attacks I decided that I'mgonna tell my parents cuz I felt like Iwas living a double life you know theonly thing I was familiar with was thesport I just thought you know I need topluck up the courage to tell them butthen down to the gym introduced them tomy coach and I think they felt reallyreassured that I wasn't going against myvalues I wasn't going against myreligion I was in a safe place so I wasfortunate enough to find a passionthat I was able to pursue and you knowthis became home for me fitness andworking out and making the most of everysingle day in every single hour that youget in that day is so so importantbecause there was a time when everythingthat I do now I couldn't do it was aluxury to be you need to get out of itso to be able to come to the gym isn'tthe tool it is a luxury and it's a lottrue that I think so many people need tostart taking advantage of shop we kindof want to get we just want to get youcoming in setting a set of the cameraafter you said you're gonna prep on adumbbell or something and then goingaway and starting a set as you wouldnormally I think people have so muchmore potential than what they even thinkthey have I think a lot of people doubtthemselves a lot of people think ohthat's sort of someone else's goalthat's not my goal we all each have ourown individual goals and everyone has somuch more potential than what they evenrealize my name is Dylan Evansand I was diagnosed with Hodgkin'slymphoma in January this year finishedwith chemotherapy three months going onup here at Kabong with down sue and histeam training making it part of thejourney get back into the cage lookingcertifier as soon as possibleMark's next year we're looking to getback in so I can sit around them in ayear of this tiny chemotherapy yeaha lot of people would be doubting oh wehave to get ready within a year of thisthat machina therapy it's a big thingbut I know I could do it and it's justfruit to people that you can makewhatever you want happen as long asyou're positive and as long as you keeptherefore with KillianI believe that hijab should never be abarrier to stop you from working out orachieving your fitness goals I think youshould just go out there don't look atanyone else and do what you've gotta doI hope people get inspired to believethat there's nothing stopping us there'snothing stopping you from going outthere to the gym just because you askoff it's okay to go to a mix gym I Ifeel like I'm alright to go to mix gymI'm alright to show everyone that I canworkout and wear my scarf at the sametime there is no problem with that theadvice I'd give to somebody who's juststarting off their fitness goals for thenew year is to allow yourself to strivefor progress but not perfectionswipe up but seriously swipe I think weall are hard on ourselves we all wantthe progress that comes superfast and wecan easily get caught up in everythingaround us it's not a sprint it's amarathonand there's gonna be days that you don'tfeel like going into the gym there'sgonna be days that you're not gonna eat100% on your diet it's about allowingyourself to take a step back and reallylook at that that bigger picture so havea goal stick to it but also realize thatyou know you're human and allow yourselfto to continue to progress even ifyou're not perfect just jump throughthere boy I'm never gonna oh there we go[Laughter]yeah so the only thing we have cheeselike obviously I can't go to the bottomlike I can't go unload a bumper that'sfine understand that anything you'redoing for the first time is gonna makeyou uncomfortable it takes a moment tobreak the ice Oh break the ice with thegym going get to know it get familiarmake it your friend and not your enemyso being able to go to the gym I don'thave to talk I just walk the walkyou know I lift the weights I do themovements I figure out the benchpressyou know I show them and people likedude you inspire me yep you don't needan excuse like I don't have an excuselike not to work out like I can't belike oh well I can't do that or maybeit's embarrassing you know it's gettinga humiliating doing things different allthe time until I've even had people liftme up to the pull-up bar there for funor I'll use the smith's-machine like theone we use cuz it's stable I'll use thatfor front pull-ups yeah so you can kindof you really keep making anything workyou just have to want it bad enoughfirst that happened that I wanted togive up was drinking regular soda whichhas a whole lot of sugar so I cut thatcold turkey that was the first thingthat I changed then I focus maybe onhitting the gym four times a week ratherthan oneso building those super small habitssticking with it that's what's going tohelp you learn to live that healthylifestyle I think the biggest thingespecially in Fitness that I would sayis to try to keep a positive attitudewhen you're starting to Train especiallyif you're not where you want to be it'skind of frustrating because you knowyou're not where you want to be in yourlife um and I really want to get hereand sometimes it takes a while and itdoes take discipline and consistencysome days are better than others somedays you're not gonna be where you wantto be but keeping a positive attitudetowards that will maintain thatconsistency and then you'll get your endresult that you're looking for keepingit fun or even going with a friend orfamily member or you know just waking upand saying today I'm gonna do my bestand that's really all that you can do soknowing that you did your best everysingle day can keep it more fun[Music]my advice for anyone who will bestarting their fitness journey for thenew year would be to start at home buildyour confidence build your strength doyour researchprep your meals plan out your meals yourday you work out get comfortable andgain their confidence and then work yourway upI very rarely go to the gym like I workout at home 95% of this I hear the samething she's changed up the equipment usetwo gallons of water I mean just getcreative you can do the same exactthings everything just looks so muchbetter on a red

on this episode Thursday January 7 2016we eat up the shoulders chest andtriceps birthday dinner I give my reviewon the gym shark types enjoy goodmorning YouTube it is 545 I'm on my wayto the gym me and Ben today have a pushworkout focusing on hypertrophy also afocus more on shoulders rather thanchest should be good I am feeling prettylimber right now no that's not the wordpretty sore I wanted to say sort of thebeginning and then I was like man Idon't I don't know match people knowthat I'm sore but yes I am sore Ihaven't been sore in a while and I thinkthis just shows that you know after aweek of like not after actually a coupleweeks during the holidays of not havingmy regular training schedule I'm feelingit I am definitely feeling the effectsof not training all the time and so mylegs are sore my my back is still kindof sore from Tuesday's pool workout sothat's awesome I mean I haven't had thisfeeling in a while so I'm making sure toget all my protein just to make sure Ican recover you ever find yourself likethis also amino acids help recoverypotassium really helps recovery so ifyou ever feel sore and need extra boostin and getting getting back on trackthose are good and number one thingwhich I am not currently getting as muchof is sleep sleep is the ultimaterecovery tool so if you can sleep atleast eight hours a day you're luckyif you have kids like me or dad orwhatever and have a lot of stuff to doyou probably won't get it but try tryyour best those are luxuries when youget into into that situation alrighttopic of the day is actually a review acouple of maybe months ago I did aninitial thoughts on Jim shark tights Ihad ordered a package of Jim char Igotta jump shark shirt and a gym sharkpair of tights that I'd always wanted totrack they're on sale and I liked thecompany I see a lot of youtubers that Ilike where um they seem pretty reputableso I bought a pair and when I got himthey were there was a slight rip on theinseam kind of on the inner thigh and Ihad figured well you know it's just alittle rip and I went to work out anddoing the work out the whole just gotbigger and bigger and then I actuallyhad to cut my workout short because itwas just too big so anyways that was notgood I ended up contacting their supportsending it back and a couple of weekslater I did get a new pair so appreciatethem sending that back I'm sure I don'tknow their support like the thing is itwas during the holiday so I know it wasbusy and they even sent email saying youknow please be patient the holidays area little busier so their support I thinktook a little longer than normal I I'massuming that their support is muchfaster but it took about a couple ofweeks for me to get my replacement pairso yesterday was the first time I got totry them for a leg day and here's mythoughts here's my review now that ihave a working product the material isis kind of a double-edged sword thematerial is a little bit more flexibleand like my nike tights the nike tightsare a little tighter more rigid this isa little more flexible so the pros areis that it feels super comfortableespecially when you're bending andsquatting and need that you know justfull range of motion I mean you have alots of give and it feels reallycomfortable the bad side is that I thinkbecause of this sometimes it can be alittle too sensitive when it comes tolike putting them on and they are proneto ripping it even says on the tag thatyou know you have to be careful when youput it on and stuff like that becausethey could rip and so I definitely tookme a little bit longer to put them onbecause I wanted to make sure they don'trip so that is kind of a you know it'snot a big deal but you just somethingyou got to remember because you justgoing through the motions you may youmay rip it so there's that but theperformance great I loved it it also hason the on the bottom part when the ankleis it has a little zipper so it makes itputting on and off taking them off alittle easier I don't know if hasanother purpose but that's for me Ithink that's what it's for and it seemsto help well yeah great pair of tightsum what I recommend getting them Irecommend trying them I think thedifference with you know different typesof different purposes I think this oneis supposed to keep you coolbecause um I felt cool through the wholething you know my legs felt nice andchilled whereas my nike ones they thepro combat ones that my nike onesactually kept me warm which you knowit's nice to keep your legs warmthroughout the whole workout so I don'tknow I'm kind of torn I like them boththey both give me different you knowresults different feelings kind of onlike I guess and if I had a rated out offive probably give it three and a halfyou know not that the shirt great lovethe shirt the tights it's okay so thatis my review if you have Jim sharktights or pet experiences with themplease comment let me know how you likethem but yeah so that's it and now iwill give you a workout commentary andi'll see you on the next clip alrightstarting off the day with HP's going for8 reps or six to eight and i went with115 i was able to get all of my setsexcept for one for eight reps the lastone I was only able to get seven so notbad um you know OHP again is something Ifeel like I am progressing in it isstill one of my weaker moves but yeahfelt great my form was feeling alrightand so to be able to hit all of that wasa big plus but yeah my cousin on thisone hasn't done this move ever and so wewant to work them in slowly so we'rejust working with a quarter on each sidereally just trying to get him a hit gethis cues right so keeping his core tightfilling it up with air and thenexploding up keeping his elbows in andall that sort of stuff he did reallywell moving on to incline dumbbell pressi started with 65 s going for 10 repshere and I was like I'll keep 65s if Ican hit a cleanat least but it was consistentlydropping so my last set i dropped itdown to 60 pounds so that i was able toget get within that range eight to tenso 60 was i was able to hit 60 s all mysets last time and so 65 seems to be agood weight that i will try to stick toand try to hit 10 reps for all my setsso here Ben I am working on his formnear something he tended to do was kindof bring his arms super wide out whichis not necessarily a bad thing but itcan put strain on your shoulders and soI wanted to avoid that and so what Iwould have him do was kind of try tofight to keep those elbows in a littlebit more at a 45 degree angle that wayhe could really focus on using his chestpushing the weight up with his chest andafter you know just reminding him andqueuing him on each rep he was able toreally start to get it better and betterso with him again we are starting withsuper lightweight because these are allnew moves for him and so we're trying toget him his form proper and I told himnot to worry about this way to just keepgoing so now moving on to seateddumbbell shoulder press just 40 poundshere but we're going for 12 reps again atypography day-to-day so high reps lowerweights I was able to hit all my setsfor 12 reps I was good it's definitelydifficult once you get to 10 so againthis is a good weight I think next timeI might go for you know 45 try toincrease in see what how many sets I canget for 12 but for that move I waspretty happy and so here same thing withthen again you can see how slow he'sgoing that's really good i'm reallytrying to get his form on point and sohe's really making an effort to makesure he's doing each move right heunderstands that it's not an ego tripwhen i'm trying to throw a bunch ofweight around I told him the weights arejust tools andreally we're trying to focus on buildingthe muscle and use whatever tool we needso if we're doing it properly then youknow we're getting a good and effectiveworkout so that's what he's doing it sohe's starting with lightweight and hisform is really good and he's reallyfeeling it he's super sore so that'sreally good now here close we're atbench press I've been doing 125s for 10reps for a few workouts now and it'sstarting to feel good you know I thinkI'm still at the point where I need tostick to this weight i'm a bump it up to130 just five pounds more because i feellike my form brakes on towards the endof each of my sets but that's expectedyou can see my elbow player just alittle bit out there it's not too badbut again i really want to keep my formclean and that way i feel it a lot ofthe triceps beds form here is reallygood actually but what you're going tosee is that we actually loaded up theweight too much for him in the beginningand so him maintaining that forms hefailed right there so I had to drop thecamera and help him out but the rest ofhis sets were fine and so we know whatwait to work with now so here I'm doingone arm at a time upright rows I wasable to increase my way here so now i'mworking with 40s whereas last time i had35 s and I was going for 12 to 15 repsand I was able to kind of stay withinthat range and so that's great that's agreat progress for me considering alsothat upright rows I used to give me painshoulder pigment in the front on myanterior delt and so by doing it one armat a time it decreases the load on thefront and so it's been helping me I'mnot getting hurt and I'm still able toget a good movement out of it so I'mreally excited about that and so hereyou'll see I'm just moving the cameraaround so that we can get the other sidebut if you're doing these you know onearm at a time type deals it's best tostart off with your weaker arm justbecause you know when you're when you'retired you're weaker arm is going to tendto give out first so it's best to getthat out of the way while you still havemore of your energythen after that move on to your strongerarm because that will because it isyou're stronger arm you're more dominantarm you'll tend to have more energythere even when your gas is running lowso just a little quick tip there whenyou're doing one at a time you can seeI'm starting to swing there this is mylast set so for give me one by formbreaks but I'm a big stickler for thatso here you see the weights kind ofsticking here I'm just doing ten poundsbut what I'm doing is a superset cableside lateral raises on each arm thenright after that super setting it intorear delts and so I'm doing it's nonstopit's a really long set and so you'regoing to see this this is pretty apretty long clip but like I said thatyou will your shoulders will be burningafter this I mean mine are burning andit's only it's only one play it's tenpounds it's not a lot of weight at allbut again trust me when you're notstopping and you're just switching oneright after the other and then you gotto do multiple sets of these you won'tneed much weight at all and so again I'mfocusing here on trying to bring myelbows higher than my my shoulder andleading with my elbow trying to focus onthat side belt that's really that youknow where you want to feel it and sothat's what I'm trying to do somekeeping my elbows slightly bent that wayit because if you keep your armsstraight out yes that's technicallyreally good form but because you'redoing that you tend to put more strainon your shoulder and we don't want tohurt ourselves so again that's why wekeep the elbow Bend slightly so that itreduces some of that load so you can seethat are the way to stick in there andthe design of our talk about here nowI'm moving on to the rear delt sobasically it's almost like the sidelateral but you're bent over here andwhat you're trying to focus is the rearpart of your shoulder the upper partthere so that's called that's the reardelt I think of it as the opposingmuscle to the pecs and so just like youwant to grow your pecs in the front youwant to grow your rear delts in the backthat way you're not front heavy soyou're not i can imagine you don't wantto be leaning forward you want to havelike a hunchback you want to have iteven all around and so that's why wework rear delts and so here's one of thetrainers at the gym is really nice hesaw that it was stick in it sohe said that it sometimes it just getsgreased up a little bit and it starts tostick so he just wiped it down for methat's why this gym is cool he don't Imean I mean like the trainers there youknow they really love this gym they lovetheir gym and you can tell I mean theylove taking care of the equipmentsometimes even as on their off timethey're just taking care making sure allthe stuff is working properly and it's agreat dream great environment so ifyou're local I can't stress enough howawesome this gym is and feel free togive it a shot color my sencha andthey'll treat you good either way buttell them I sent you and maybe you knowthey'll like me more i don't know butanyway so yeah here's the end this isthe last part of it you see how longthis set was finally last move gableoverhead extension one more tricep movegoing for I mean 15 reps is the goal buti'm happy with 12 to 15 here and so ifthis is a lot of weight i mean i do 110for 10 reps that's usually what i can dobut dropped it 100 to see if I can't Icouldn't get you know 15 I fell withinthe 11 to 15 range so couldn't get 15for all of them I was able to get at myfirst set but anywhere in that range i'mnot happy wit so that now i havesomething to work towards hope you guysenjoyed it here's the entire thingwhat's up guys it's 920 after the gym Istopped by mcdonalds got some eggmcmuffins but I used the egg whitesinstead so I got two of those I'm goingto have that as like my breakfast Iusually don't eat this early but feelinga little hungry today so might as welleat something the only thing aboutworking in the morning is working out inthe morning is I don't have a lot ofoptions for lunch unless I go back outso i don't really like to go back outagain but I'm going to have this I haveone more in about three and then I hadmy protein shake after the workout sothat's that was another protein sourcethat I had so I'm going to do that checkout the macros not really sure what itis yet but after that then i will seewhere I'm at alright guys it's lunchtime so I'm going to have another eggmcmuffin the egg white because Marissadidn't eat it and so instead of lettingyou go to waste I'm going to chil thatdown also got a mint chocolate chip plusbar let's all one of the bites i had togive them a bite and then a light isthis a like light and fit strawberrycheesecake there we go so that will belunch whats up guys its 630pm about tohead to what we're going to drop knowwhy let's all off at my parents housethey're going to babysit for us they aregoing to babysit Hannah too and then wemean Merce are going to go to placecalled why not pizzeria she's a littleitalian pizzeria place to celebrate afriend's birthday today so we're goingto be there with a few friends talionfood isn't always the most macrofriendly so i'm going to see what i cando i am going to try to stick to mymacros this morning i weighed in at 150so that's good kind of right back towhere I was but we'll see i'm going totry to stick to my macros I I ate prettygood so far so I have a little bit toplay with but i'll just try if anythingnot to gotoo overboard that way it doesn't affectme too much but that's the plan andwe'll see you guys in there all rightguys just going to give you a briefmyfitnesspal update post-workout had myprotein shake for breakfast I had thosetwo egg white mcmuffins and then forlunch I had the third one becauseMarissa didn't eat it and i also had myyogurt as well as a mint chocolate chipquest bar and then tonight we ate outfor our friend's birthday and this isjust a guesstimate but I had a six inchitalian sub with a on wheat wheat breadand i had no cheese i had double meatjust to make sure i got a lot of proteinthere so don't know exactly the proteincount but you guys saw that i also hadsome fries which isn't on here and Ialso had about three quarters of achocolate lava cake with some vanillagelato so I'm definitely i'm pretty surei'm over i'm like pretty confident I'mover this 20 100 calorie mark i know i'mslightly over my carbs definitely overmy fat i am pretty confident i have myprotein as well so a little bit overtoday not as OnPoint as the past fewdays but again you know i mean that'sjust what happens sometimes you know youcelebrate and go a little overboardagain please don't think that I just goover all the time I am on a bulk stilleven though I am trimming some of thisholiday weight so I'm not as strict as Inormally would be if I was on a cut nowif I'm cutting you guys will see andhave seen in my previous videos thatI'll be pretty strict and so when I dobegin cutting season I'm going to be asstrict as possible and so even when weeat out I will be finding things I knowfor sure have goodmacros but for now it's it's okay to bea little bit off I'm still training hardi'm still in a surplus so not a big dealbut anyways i'll just continue to kindof track to maintain this weight thinkmy game plan now is to just stay here soi'm going to find my maintenancecalories and then just kind of stickhere stay around here and then at thegym just try to keep getting strongerkeep gaining muscle mass and I think youknow if I can stay here for the rest ofthis kind of bulking surplus season thenit'll be great when it comes time to cutbecause then it won't be such a drasticmeasure of having to lose weight so thatis my game plan again I just kind of gowith the flow i have a general idea butyou know life changes all the time andso I'm just kind of flexibly planning soI have a plan but I'm also flexible andthat sort of thing I hope you guys kindof understand that and hopefully ithelps you in your journey you knowunless you're a professional competitorthen we got to live life and so it'salways adjusting according to plan sothat is today's recap thanks again forwatching please like share and subscribeI do really appreciate all the support

hi everyone my name is lisa and i'mgetting fit[Music]i'm going to be judging these on threethings i don't know why i'm holding uptwo fingers but three thingsfirst is aesthetics obviously how itlooks on the secondis price because some of these gym shockpieces can be a bit priceyand the third is how it looks on andi'll be rating these on a scale of 1 to10and at the end i will be lying all thepieces frommost favorite to least favorite so youcan see and you've got a good overviewso yeah let's get started okay so ithink this isall i've got most of them are leggingsand topsi've got one pair of shorts and i've gota jacket as wellhopefully they all still fit me right sofirst off we're starting with thebottomsthese are leggings and i've got one pairof shorts with them as well i'll do myshorts at the end butwe're going to start with leggings thesearethe new shark legacy fitness leggings inthe colorblue stone they've got pockets on thesidea logo at the back i really do like themthey're lightweight they've got thisnice soft fabricthe only thing is the waistband is notthat compressingyeah as you can see my waistband isalready pulling down a little bit whichis a shameso aesthetics i'd give them an 8 out of10. i think they look really nice withthe logo at the backand i like the mesh at the bottom aswell i like the pocketsthe fit on me i would say is a7 out of 10. i would wear them onnon-intensive days the price was goodbecause it was notfull price but normally if it's fullprice i think it's a bit pricey but forthe pricei bought them i think it was an 8 out of10. i do like them so yeah those are thelegacy fitness leggingsnext up is the gym shark crest joggersthese are actually from the men's rangethey are a size large they're justregular joggersthe only thing i say with these joggersis that when you try them on umit's just the fluff from the inside justgets everywhere which is not greatthese are the only men's joggers i'vegot so maybe the other colors aredifferent i don't knowbut they're all right for a lazy day iwouldn't really necessarily work out inthese but that's just my personalpreferencefor the aesthetics i give them asix or seven i mean they're plain blackjoggers what else do you wanti like the logo on the side for the fitthey fit well on mei like them to be a bit baggier but youknow i got them in a size large so maybeget an extra size up if you want them tobe a bit baggieri give them a five actually just becausei don't like the fluff that getseverywhere when you put them on i don'tlikei have to hoover every time i put thesejoggers on and thenfor the price i give them an eightbecause they're really goodvalue for money um 20 quid for a pair ofjoggers i don't think that's badso yeah let's move on next up isthe energy plus seamless in blacksize large i absolutely love these thesei thinkare a staple in every girl's wardrobe ilike the little detailing on the sidelet's do squat testlittle right i like that the waistbandgoes this high up like that waistbandand it also holds up very well whenyou're doing intensive sports likerunningnow because i like these so much i'vegot them in multiple colorsi've got them in a lovely burgundy redwhich is very nice i'll do squat testsin these and i got them ina lovely pink which i think is one ofthe olderversions because the waistband is a bittighter on these these are bothsize medium and these are just myall-time fave i'd sayfor aesthetics i'd give them an 8because i like the detailing on thelegs and they're not that plain for thefit i give them a 10 because they justfit me so wellprice i mean they're pricey i give thema seven for price because they're justreally pricey i mean i got these secondhandthey were great i think they're probablymy favorite leggings frommy current gymshark pieces next up isthe ombrein black and grey this is a size mediummy boyfriend and i went on a bike ridethe other day and he kindly pointed outthat these are a bit see-throughbut they look so nice i like thewaistband it keeps mein it's not as big i think the energyseamless is about that big but if you'reokay with that then that's fineso for aesthetics i'd give them a 9 outof 10 because i just love the ombrecolors for fit i'd give them a 7 out of10 purely because they're a sizetoo small on me which makes themsee-through a bit and forprice i give them a seven for pricelet's move on to the next onenext up we've got the boys leggings andthe color greenthey are very lightweight they've gotpocketsso as you can see my thumb is shiningthroughthese are a size medium so i do have asize two small in themthey've got an extra layer of fabric atthe back as you can see they're notsee-through at all because they've gotthat extra layer of fabricbut yeah the rest is just the front isreally see-throughthey're just a size too small for mereally i'd love to give them a highmark i've had them in size l but i soldthem and now they're sold out on thewebsite so i got the second hand one asiam aesthetically i'd give them a seventhey're all right they're nice colorthey're bright which is something idon't really have i mean i've got likepinks and blues and stuff but i don'treally have many bright bright colorslike this green one i like the pocketsso i give them a seven bit on me they'rereally see-throughunfortunately at the front so i givethem a six for fitand then for price i'd give them a sevenbut they're sold out so you know youcan't really get them at the moment idon't think they're going to berestocking them either but yeah if youcan get them on depop i think they willbe worth it especially for in the summerthey're really lightweight like thelegacy onesbut yeah moving on next up we've got oneof my all-timefavorites which is the camo seamless theleggings are a bit muddy because itrained in themwith my pt the other day and i am yet towash thembut these are the green ones this is oneof my favorite collectionsi've got this one in green in m i've gotthe blue one inl so as you can see they're pretty thickmaterial theyare not see-through at all which is nicethese are the old collections so theyare called the camoseamus this is the new collection it'scalled the adaptcamo this is color light green but it'sreally justit's light blue but it's called lightgreen on the website i don't know why sothis is the newfabric new collection it's a bit lessfabricso it's a bit less thick hey guys it'sediting lisa hereonce again i totally forgot to rate mycamo seamless probably because i wasjust in all of them foraesthetics i would give them an 9 out of10 because i just love the camo patternit just makes me feel like i'm in thearmy just going for a boot campevery time i put them on makes me feelbadass so fit i would saya nine out of ten as well because theyjust fit me so welland then price i would say seven becausethey're just a bit pricey just like theenergy seamless really yeah there we gookay so this didn't go well um i can'tget these on anymoresad so i can't get these on anymore thisis a sizem i believe they're the seed leggingsthey've got pocketsi don't know what color this is but ialways call it nude because it'sbasically my skin tonehonestly i lived in these when i wasrunning because even though thewaistband doesn't seem like it's thatcompressive it kind of isthey've got nice detailing at the backas well for your bum soi can't really rate them because i can'tget them on but i'd sayaesthetic wise i mean they're just plainleggings really soi'd give them a i don't know probably asix fitwell when i've did fit them it was latebut now i was obviously zero but i'lljustrate it at the point where i did fitthem so it's gonna be an eight and thenprice i don't think they were thatexpensive so i'd give themuh an eight as well now the last oneand i'm for sure not gonna fit intothese are the sculptleggings which again they've got pocketsthey've got a little butch grunge hereas you can see and the waistband againit's really nice for runninghigh intensity sports but unfortunatelyi'm not going to fit into them either sothat is a shame these are a size m aswellaesthetics i'm gonna give them a sevenbecause they're a nice colorbut not as nice as like for example thecamo forfit i'm gonna give them they're quitetight actually they're really tight soi'm gonna give them a seveneven when i could fit in them they werequite tight and then forprice gonna give them a seven so yeahthose are all my leggings i'm gonna putthem out for you from most favorite toleast favorite right nownow for the shorts i've got two shortsto show you actuallythese are the training short shorts ifi'm not mistakeni use them for pole dancing mostly thefabric is really nice got the logo hereon the sideas you can see they come up really highwaisted which is nicethey shall have a lot of booty so ifyou've got a big buttthese might not be the ones for youunless you do want to show off whichby all means go ahead for pole dancingyou need a lot of skin to grip on thepole especially between your legsi think these shorts are great foraesthetics i'd give them an a for fitto me personally i'd give them an 8 aswell and for pricei don't think they're pricey so i'd givethem an a as well now moving on to thenextpair of shorts these are the flexcycling shorts as you can see they comereally high up this is what the backlooks likegot the logo here on the side i don'thave any flex leggings becausei know that there are a lot of people'sfavorites but for me the waistband isjustso tiny but it gives me this massivebulge it doesn't keep me in at all likethat's why i love the energy waistbandbecause it comes literally to here i dolovethe butt area it's accentuated by theshadows i do love that againmy waistband just keeps rolling likethis so you can't really see the logo atalli will wear this in summer usually theydon't roll up which is why i went fullycycling once becausethe other shorts i feel like they alwaysroll up my thighsso that's why i like to go for thelonger ones i would just love it ifthey've got pockets thoughthose are the shorts that i have i don'thave any other shorts becausei would love if they had pockets butthey just don't nogym shark shorts do apart from thenon-stop leggings but they're sold outalways sofor aesthetics i would give them a sevenbecause i do like the detailing on thebutt for fit i'd give them a six justbecause i get really insecure sometimesbecause of the waistband and price wisei think they're right so give them aseven for priceand those are the shortsso now we're moving on to sports brasnow i've got a fewi've got these which are the energy plusto gowith my energy plus leggings i just putmy energy plus on because i like themthe bestthis is what the back looks like ireally like these actuallythey're not high impact so i wouldn'treally wear them out runningbut they're really nice just for normalsports like leg daytotal body workout just not really thathigh intensity ones especiallyif you've got bigger boobies i like thislittle detailing here because it comesback in the leggingi like this because it gives it a littlebit of a sexy vibeyeah so i really like these actuallyi've got them in a few other colorsi've got them in burgundy to go with myburgundy leggings these are a sizemedium this one is a largeand i've got them in the top the croptop which comes a bit lowerit's a bit more support as you can seethis comes a bit lower to the pointwhere it almost touches my leggingactually this is the backas you can see it keeps going way morethan the bra doesand i wear these on more intense dayswhen i know i'm going for a run ori'm jumping around dancing or whatever ibelieve these are size medium can bewrong though for the brai think aesthetics wise i really likethe straps so i'd give theman eight for the fit i really like howthey fitagain they're not for high intensityworkouts they're morejust now around in or do leg day orupper body day with but they're not forlikejumping around if you've got biggerboobs so for that reason i'd give thefit a7and for price you know the price is allright i give them a seven for priceso moving on the crop top that i justshowed you i'dgive them for aesthetics a7 because it'snot as strappy it's not as likenice it's more like a top but they dokeep the girls in so i give them for fitand eight so i just turn around and fora price i give them a seven as wellthose are the energy plusbras that i have now we're moving on tothe next one this is theadapt mall seamless sports brait's got two layers first one is just abra and thenit comes up like this so you can pull itup however you want really to give youextra support which is nicethis is what the back looks like i lovethe back i love the little strappydetailing on the back this is a sizelarge the price is a bit it's a bitpricey it's 35 quid on the website rightnowfor aesthetics i'd give them an eightbecause even though the front is playingthe backers justlike show off for fit i give them an 8as well because they really aresupportivei feel like i can do more high intensityexercises with this braand for the price i give them a sixbecause they're quite pricey the 35quid which is as much as like one of theleggings but other than that they'rejust really goodthis is the open back training sportsbra i've got it in a sizemedium which is a shame because i can'tclose it out the backi've bought this last year and obviouslyi've gained weight but honestly i lovethis bra because it's high impact i worethese for pole dancing all the timealong with my burgundy shorts because ijust love the fit but yeah i just grewout of it reallyso for aesthetics i would give them aseven i like the mesh detailing here butit's not that exciting other bra for fiti'd give themwell when i did fit them i'd give them aseven becauseeven when i did fit them they were quitetight and for pricethey're in sale right now so that'sgreat they're like 20 quid right now orsomething so i'd give them an eight forpricenow next up we've got this ruched sportsbranow i would say my ideal size would be asize up at the moment this is a mediumi'd rather have the size large at themoment which is why i don't reallywear this a lot because even if there'sa great sightit actually is quite tight on me so itdoesgive a nice push-up effect but yeahon the other hand it's just a bit tightat the moment and the back looks likethisso you've got this like crisscrossstripes going on which is actually quiteniceso for aesthetics i would say this isthe onethat looks the nicest on so i'd givethis one aesthetically a nineif it fits properly i'd say it'san eight because it's really supportiveprice wise i'd say i'd give it a sevenbecause it's not the most expensive oneit's not the least expensive onelet's move on to the next one so this iswhat the sports bra looks onactually has two straps so this one isactually for the brathey they are together like you can'tput them apart but they've got twostrapsfor extra support which they also giveand i just wear them all the time i'vegotnothing bad to say about them honestlythey're great[Music]right those are all the sports bras iwill lay them out for you guysright now and then we'll go over to the[Music]topsthe first top i'm going to show you guysis thislegacy top this is the long sleeve croptop so as you can see it's quite highcroppedwhich is not really my taste this wasthe first top i bought this is what theback looks likeso you've got the big logo on the backwhich i actually really like but becauseit's so croppedi am a bit insecure in this onesometimes i love the littlethumb holes i don't know if that makessense four aesthetics i would give thisonea seven i like the logo at the back butalsoi'm aware that it looks a bit like idon't know the fabric just looks a bitlike it's a pajama shirt i don't knowif that makes sense i don't necessarilylike the buttons hereyeah it just doesn't really feel like aworkout top to meyou will know what i mean when i showyou the other ones fit wisei would just like it to be more downhere i would give this a six for fitbecause honestly i've been wearing itlike maybe three times and thenprice wise so for up top it's notactually that expensive it's 25 poundswhich issome of the sports bras are 25 pounds soprice-wise would give this one an eightbecauseit's quite cheap so yeah let's move onto the next oneas you can see this one still has thetag on but we're just gonna ignore thatthis is the flexprop top and as i said with the fabricit's kind of the fabric of the leggingwhich is very nice to work out in and ireally like that again it's got thethumb holesleeve thingies it's much lower cropwiseit actually will go over my legging thisis the backas you can see here the logo just likewith the flat shortsbut this is an m which i feel like is abit too small for me right now which iswhy i haven't worn it out a lotso aesthetically i'd give this one asevenbecause it's not my most favorite onebut it's not the worst oneeither it will fit really nicely withthe shorts in the summernow for fit fit wise i'd give this one aseven right now becausei feel like it's a bit tight on me butmaybe i'll grow into it who knows andprice wisethis one is 35 pounds on the websitewhich not the best not the worst i'dgive this one a seven for priceso this one is the camo long sleeve croptopif you follow me on instagram which isat least a tb fit by the wayyou will have seen that i have worn thisout quite a lotbecause i absolutely love it even thoughit's a size mit's a bit tight on me but i do reallylike it it's got the logo here on thehandagain it's got the thumb holes this iswhat the back looks likei like the little circles that show offyour sports braunderneath and yeah i just love it i'mnot sureactually i'm not sure about this becauseobviously you've got the butt scrunch onthe camoand you've got this on the top which i'mstill not sure if i actually like thatbut i love the color it's a great top towork out in as wellwhen it's a bit colder out i usuallywear this underneathmy jumper when i go running soaesthetically i'd give this one an8 because i like the aesthetics of thecamo i would have given it a 9 but i'mstill not sure about this bitnow fit wise i'd give this one a nineprice wise this is the same price as theflex top so i'd give this a seven aswell for priceso there we go one of my all-time favesthis one this is the ombrethis is the last of the long sleeve croptops that i'm going to show you itdoesn't have some holes butwhat the camo's got here on the boobarea the ombrehas got on the back area which iabsolutely loveand even though the crop is a bit highi do still really like it i love thati've got a set in this one aestheticallyi'd give this a nine because i just lovethe ombretogether with the ombre leggings it'sjust beautiful it's one of my all-timefavoritesfit i'd give this a seven at the momentjust because it's a bit tight on meright now i think it's a tighter selfall of them actuallyprice wise this is also 35 quid so againit's a seven yeah that's basically allthese long sleeve crop tops i'm showingyounow let's move on to the other crop topsi've got andthe normal tops this is the rewindtea it's actually not available anymoreon the website i justsee but when i bought them i bought themin netherlands so it was 30 euros whichcomes to28 pounds ish i lived in these this is asize mediumas you can see they're a bit tightaround the arms now i've also got themin the pink color i think they're justso cute obviously you've got like thegymshark logo but it's like cut offand then it goes on here and you've gotlike a half offa gymshark logo which you also could seeon the legacy crop topi don't know why they're not on thewebsite anymore but maybe you can getone second handaesthetically i'd give this one an eightbecausethey're fun they're different and i likethe design a lotfit i just live in these so i'd givethema nine out of ten for price well theywere actually quite alright price wisethey were like 28with i think 28 pounds but yeah they'renot available anymore which is a shameso this is the essential tea it's got alittle slit on the sideso you can tie it up as well which thenlooks like thisand you've got a little crop top it'sgot the logo hereit's a nice little t-shirt to throw onif you want to cover yourself up i'vegot them in yas well in size l this one is definitelyabit more c3 you can definitely see thelines and the color actuallyi think of the sports bra aestheticallyi'd give this one an eight because ofthe slit and because it's a funny designfit wise i'd sayseven the price is so nice it's 18pounds for this one which is great it'snot on sale butthe full price would be 18 pounds whichhonestly 40 like thisis great so i'd give the price an eightto be honest i like that it's so cheapand yeahat first glance you'd think this is acrop top but noit's a full-sized t-shirt it's actuallythe vital seamless long sleeve topit's got the logo over here it's a bitsee-throughi do like it i do wear it out forrunning a lotit's got the little thumb holes sleeveswhatever you want to call themand yeah i really like them so this onei bought the most recently along withanother vital seamless t-shirt which isnot long sleevethis one is a size large because theextra largewas sold out aesthetically i'd give thisonea six you know it's not it's not thatexciting to be honest it's got the layerhere butthere's not really that much of a designgoing on obviously it's got like thebreathing holes and stuff butother than that it's not that excitingso sixthe fit on me i think is a seven becauseit's quite tight fitting which iwouldn't reallynecessarily wear on his own and thenprice wise this is 30 poundsso i'd give this one a seven as well forprice because it's not the cheapestnot the most expensive but yeah that'sthevital seamless long sleeve top now we goto theshorts leaf top now this oneis the t-shirt it's a vital seamlesst-shirt so this one is a sizeextra large which means it's not astight fitting i mean it's still tightobviously butit's not as tight fitting which is why iwould probably wear thison its own when it gets warmer againunderneath it says bevisionary which is their slogan which isquite cuteso aesthetically again i'd give this a 6because you know it's just not thatexciting really fit wise i'd give it asan 8 because it fits me better than theother oneand price wise i'd give this one an 8 aswell because it's 25 pounds it's notthat much you'd buya t-shirt in a shop for 25 pounds likeyou know it's not thatexpensive if that makes sense it's timefor the men's rangebecause yes i actually do worth stufffrom the men's rangei feel like it's so much cheaper you getso much more valuefor your money so i've worn this t-shirtwhen i worked out a lot it's thecontrastt-shirt and believe it or not it'sactually12 pound 60. now this was in salebut even so it's very cheap this is whatit looks like so i like this little bitthis blockit's long which is nice it's not astightfitting which is also nice i'm sure ifyou regularly shop at gymsharki'm sure i'm not the only one that buysfrom the men's range because honestlythey're a steal this is a great t-shirtit's one of my staples so aestheticallyi'd give this onea seven because i like the little blockbut that's the only thing going on onthe t-shirt so forthe fit i give it an eight because itfits me really nicely and i like it alot and priceand nine baby it's so cheapso price and nine and let's move on tothe other man's t-shirt i've gotall right so this is the glitch t-shirtalso in an m there's a nice color i lovethe logo on the frontit's the same fabric as the othert-shirt it's a nicesoft kind of fabric and i really reallylike it ohthe price of this one was nine poundsladies and gentlemen nine poundsi mean it wasn't sale but still againit's full sized it doesn't really hugyour figure as much as like the vitalseamless t-shirts dobut honestly i prefer it that wayespecially at the moment with my littlebelly going onaesthetically i'd give this one an eightbecause it's more fun than the last oneand fit i'd give this one an eight aswell because it fits me just asit does the contrast t-shirts really prhowprice wise i give this one a 10 becausehonestly if you can get this cheap in asaleit's great it's great so yeah i've gottwo morethings to show you one of them is a vestand the other oneis the jacket okayi don't know why i bought this and mostof allwhy i kept it because this is my firstand only tank top that i bought andthis might be the reason why this isjusthorrible the fit the fabric is that kindof swimwear fabriclike on the website it looks really nicelike it just kind of like flows downbut honestly this is horriblethis is the back like ohi don't get it at all no things aboutthis tank top are great to be honestwith you this is the laser cuttank top for aesthetics i mean theytriedi like this little bit the design but idon't like the back at allto aesthetically be a fall from me fitagain just horrible for price20 pounds for a tank top like this whichis literally justswimwear fabric i think it's a four aswell or even a three likeso yeah price three sorry this has justgot the lowest rating because i reallydon't like this i've worn this onceand that's it i've had it for over twoyears i don't know why i've gotten ridof it yetanyway yeah no no no from me now lastbut certainly not least is theillumination jacketit's got pockets here right here this isthe backas you can see it's cropped but it goesin at this bit so it's kind of likebaggy at thetop[Music]so i haven't had the chance to wear thisout yet but obviouslythe illumination range is meant toilluminatewhen light is being shined on it i likeit it's got little gymshark logos allover itit's got the little pockets where youcan put your phone in soi think this is a size m aesthetics ithinkthis deserves a nine from me i reallylikethe way it looks on me i really like thewayit feels fit wise i think it's an eightbecauseit's a size m which makes it kind oftight at the waist right nowthe only thing with this jacket isthe price it's really expensive fullprice on a website it would be between60 and 70 quid whichis just insane i got this in sale for 42but still it's a lot um so price wise itgets a five for me becauseit's not that much fabric it doesn'thave to be so expensiveright guys that is all the gymsharkpieces i have right nowthat was a lot to get through but i hopeyou

gonna do right herewe're gonna do the small fit taperbottoms version two so here we go okayreal quick first first two things toknow I hope inthis thing immediatelythey got a new tag element createsomething with extraordinary performancewear be a visionaryand look at this it's like a said thisis a new tag it was not like this beforethat's pretty cool and then on theinside over here this is new as well youknow how normally pants they have likelook this thing right here yeah I'mgoing to show you this is these are thefit tapered bottoms version of one okaythese are the version ones hey focusHey okay so look inside they got the JimSharkey that's like this this materialright small thing now the new ones lookat this it's like a big piece of clothhanging here you got to cut it off butthat's pretty cool the big piece ofcloth nice telling you how to take careof and everything be visionary that'skind of cool all right so put these onto show you what they look like alrightguys so I got them on I got him on sonow I'm gonna give you my firstimpression it's gonna be completelyhonest as always and I'm gonna give youall the dirty details so here we goalright guys so here they are this iswhat it looks like right here alrightthere's me there's me here are the pantsas you can see they are fit they aretapered they are bottoms so here theyare show you the side view thank you soremember these are small okay I mightnot think you have medium eventuallybecause I'm currently bulking and theseare pretty tired alreadyI'm only at the beginning light bulb -so this is what they look like over allof you okay you guys got itwe did now let me go over the feel andeverything so these these fit taperedbottoms version two they feel prettymuch exactly like the version of onesthey're I mean they're like a little I'dsay maybe a little tighter it might be alittle tighter but the feel is prettymuch the same they're very stretchy verycomfortable yeah these are extremelystretchy extremely comfortable so the 50per bottom so these feel very good verygood and now let me show you the detailsso they got the white Jim shark logothing right there and also on the bootyzoom it in got a white the white sharkright thereokay and then down here they got zippersat the bottom and this is kind ofinterestingso zippers at the bottom and then theygot zippers over here zippers on thepockets as well this okay no zippers onthe back though no zippers on these backpockets so now let me show you thecomparison show the difference betweenthese ones and the old onesso here the old ones okay fit taperedbottoms oh hold on let me weigh I'm outfifty-four bottoms version one righthere so look at the zipper see younotice it's just purely a zipper rightnow look at these ones they felt likethe the lining on the side of the zipperso that should provide more durabilityanyways I think it's nice it feels a loteasier to slide it up and down actuallyso that's pretty nice and then anotherdifference is the drawstring right heresee this is you know pretty plaindrawstring or whatever right now look atthe new version they got like thesemetal rings that say Jim shark on themand then this drawstringlook at the the we've compared to thisone this is like a more thicker coarseweave this one's a weave a lot moreweaves so it should be more durable andthen at the end look they've got thesecap things on it looking like fish oilpills or something but this focus okayas opposed to just like this look thisis what happens to the old ones it'slike this plastic thing around the topand there's nothing covering the top soplastic wears off the top wears you seebut that should not happen because nowwe're completely capped off with thisokay so that pretty much covers thesefirst fit taper bottom versions twos incomparison with the fit taper bottomversion one so now let's move on to theluxe bottom version tubes alright solet's take know right away you take thisthing out of the package and here it isnew tag look Jim strug legacy be part ofsomething legendary join our legacy sothis is pretty cool tag look at thisthis is new it's it's you know this isreally not part of the pants but it'sjust something cool that they do youknow I mean I think it's nice that theyshow care into like every single part oftheir their packaging and everything iscool and then again the tag on theinside is not even a tag it's a hugepiece of cloth attached to the insidethat you got to cut off very nice sothat is cool so now let's put these onand show you what they look likeholy moly alright guys so here they areversion two luxe bottoms so these lookpretty freakin cool alright let's checkit out check it out check it out checkit out so yeah these are remember theseare small so these actually fit verywell ok so now let me give you my let megive you my first let me give you myimpression so when I first saw someother reviewsor some other people advertising theselike you know Matt Ogas Christian guzmányou know they're like that I know thesethese new version to Lux are so goodit's like so amazing my bladder I don'treally know what where's the peace butpretty much the idea is that oh thisversion - so much better than Persianone it's its innovative love apply and Iwas like I don't know if I believe thatbecause all these guys are sponsoringbudget shark and to be honest the pantslook the pants and the jacket lookalmost exactly the same as the versionone look here's a version one right hereluxe version one a very similar look tothe version - I mean it looks almost thesame so how different could it be butupon putting these on actually theselike the paper bottoms they're prettymuch the same as the version version one- they feel pretty much the same butthese luxe bottoms feel extremelydifferent so you know these they'repretty warm the insides like thispolicie material okay but the inside ofthis it's like a different type offleece look at this different fleecymaterial and the difference is is thatthese version twos are very they're verysoft like these are soft but they're notthat flexible they're not very stretchythese ones are actually stretchy like Inever felt like I could do squats andstuff very comfortably in the versionones I mean I could do it in these cuzthese are medium so they're likeactually pretty baggy so I got smalls onright now but these aren't very stretchybut this version these versions two onesthey're actually pretty freakin stretchyI feel like I could do squats on themlike check it out check it out watchwatch watch watch watch let's try it outthat no problem like easy easy look atthat it's like stretchy like nopestretchy stretchy okay so like theseactually these are these are extremelysoft really comfortable and they'restretchy like they actually feel verygood okay so now let's go over thesubtle differences between these onesand the other ones so the onlydifference in designreally is the stripe so look the oldones they did not have this striperunning down the side so that's kind ofa nice stylistic change I do like thisone as I said I'm not sure about theblack and gray color or the black andwhite color didn't didn't look that coolI really like this color scheme but youknow they all this feels really good somust must be pretty decent but this isthe only stylistic change really it'sjust the stripe and subtle differencesnow I love to go over i'ma walk you overhere so here's the version one right sowe have the same difference in thedrawstring this is pretty plain boringyou know pretty local I just draw astring to be honest look at this it'swearing out eight folks yeah top iswearing out again it's the same thingover here look they got the metallicrings I say Jim shark on it betterweaves higher-quality drawstring it'sthicker and then it's capped off so it'snot gonna just die in the washingmachine after a few rounds theoreticallyokay and then now look at the zipperdown here look at this look at this yousee the zipper because it's just azipper and then look at this thing manso this is the old version one it's justlike a metal zipper right and as you cansee once you wash it a few times thecolors coming off and it's showing themetal doesn't look that great right butnow look at the new version it's stilljust the zipper but look now it said Iwas like this is plastic thing on itwith the Jim sharks symbol so this isnot going to s so zipper right thisthing gets screwed in the washingmachine okay now we got a plastic one soproblem solved there's not gonna becolor falling off of here showing somemetal under underparts okay so that'spretty good and then now another thingis so here look at this so this is thishow the pocket used to be right is openpockets which could be dangerous but nowlet's look at the new pockets Oh whatthe heck there's a zipper over here andthen once again we got the same plasticplastic thing right here so there's nonot gonna be any pulling off and it'seasier to grab so now we got zippers onthe pockets so stuffs not gonna fall outof your pockets which is very good soyeahit's okay so overall I actually do thinkactually I do think there is quite alarge difference in the luxe version oneto version two is the fifth Taborbottoms there's not too much differenceexcept just the change in the drawstringreally you know but the change in theseluxe once it's pretty it's pretty nicethey feel a lot I feel a lot stretchhere they feel a lot softer they got thezippers on the pockets which is verynice and then they upgraded the zippertag things on the bottom so yeah there'sa quite a quite a big quite a bigdifference so those that's pretty muchit for the comparison and the dirtypiece about the luxe version one toversion two and then the luck and thenthe fifty four bottoms worse to want toversion two hopefully that helped youguys out if you're trying to orderanything and if you have any questionsyou know as always leave comments belowbut I told you my height and my weightand everything already so don't have tobe Pat just hitting asking or anywaysbut you know it's in the description boxas well that's gonna wrap this review uphope it was useful to you and I'll

so well together this is a jumpshot by the way I didn't buy any gymtrack tops kind of wishing I kind of athing I did get the matching set but thelilac does go well I think it goes wellwith black so yeah I'm going to stand upon the couchso you guys can see what they look likefrom behindalso the other thing was people wereworried about was the length of themwell I'll show you evenlythis is where they come to so just abovethe ankle there I love Jim Chuck hallsand reviews that I saw had peopletalking about having to roll them up atthe bottom but I don't know I'm fivefoot five five foot sixum I'm not Jayant and I don't know ifit's because I got the size it's you'resmall or I don't know but they fitpretty well for me I like the link forthem I like the way that they come justabove the ankle I think it's cute soonce again yeah little boutique on tourI actually just I'm obsessed with thiscolor I think it's so prettyyeah okay so that was the purple gymshot slicks leggings which I really likeit's a my honest gym shot hall review Iwould say love love the quality love thecolor love the feel of them yeah I feellike they could have gone and size upwith no worries at all but I do like theextra small and the way it fitson the waist oh now I'm living betterdays I check in the back cover of themagazine[Music]okay so the next pair of gym shots licksleggings are these these pink flixleggingsso both gray and pink so it's got thepink waistband and then gray light grayI actually love this color combotogether I think it's just so gorgeousand so pretty yeah I'm really excited totry these ones on I think they're justwould look so good with like on any skintone any skin color I think they'd lookso beautiful so okay let's try these onall right so these are the light grayand pink and my initial thoughts onthese were the material this material isjust like a bit more thinner than thepurple one and they just rode on but Ikind of feel like it's in a good waylike I feel like there's a little bitmore flex and then where's the otherones I thought they were a little bitmore compressed but honest to god I amobsessed with this color like that pinkand gray goes so good together like ohI'm gonna love so I'm really reallyhappy that I got them in extra-small andthis color I don't know if the sizing isjust different for different colors butthey just feel like these fit just alittle bit better than the other onesso extra small fits good on these I likethe way that they contour the booty giveit a bit of perk should we do a squattest on these as well see how theyperformyeah I just think I just really like thecontouring on these ones a bit betterthan the paper ones like they fit reallynice Ohliterally in love yeahoh my god I honestly love these Jimshark flex leggings guys jump shot youhave outdone yourself and I've gotnothing to compare it to but Jim shark Ifreakin love you you're amazingyou really know how to make a ghostheight look good anyway so next pair arethese blue ones check that uplook at that color combo so it's likethis aquamarine color with like blue andthen it's got the contouring on the burnI actually love this color of themorning this color foot so freakin longI'm so excited to try these onI'm gonna put them on now so yeah I'mgonna try mom okay so I've got theballoon jump shot flick slings on andinitial thoughts of these ones as wellif the material felt really similar tothe gray and pink ones where it was itwas easy easier to get on it wasn't sotight and when I just looked at thisbooty contouring I feel like it it'sdefinitely a little bit nicer than thepurple ones the very first ones I triedon still they're all amazing I don'tknow I feel like they're probably alldesigned the same way maybe it's just onmy head and the way I'm looking at it ormaybe it's just the colors but oh I lovethe blue so far these are I don't knowthis might be my favorite[Music]beautiful[Music]so yes and this is the length of themhere so again they come right down to myankles yes so they both come right downto the ankles waist bands just over thebelly button but I kind of think thatthat's the way I like it I think itlooks really cute with a little crop topon I thought I'll show you guys up onthe couch so you guys can get an idea ofthe full length of them so yeah this islike the full length what they look likelike this so sick okayand now the gym sock flex shorts which Ihave also obviously been excited to tryon these ones here so these are the onesthat I went up a sizewell I went to say it's small in theseones and the inside is just more for allthree of the gym shack leggings but yeahjust after like watching some gym shackreviews and watching what people had tosay about the gym shack flix range theydid say it to size up and the shorts soyeah mix I just try these on look atthat color though this I was gonna getthis sort of light blueylike blue green aqua color in theleggings because I had these ones andthey full-length but I thought I'd gofor these in the shorts and then it getsthe baby pink with the gray the leggingswhich I love these are amazingokay so for my last gibberish at FortTryon item I'm gonna try on these

it's super flattering on the butt it'snot very sweat proofgym shark loves to sell out quickly thatwasn't by accident peopleit's not restricting my motion like atall thistop needs to be a little longer hey guysand welcome back to my channeland today we were talking about thegymshark x whitney simmons collectionfiascosorry i mean launch that happened acouple weeks agoand usually i'm really on top of it iget my videos outasap but as i said it was a fiasco thereare a few things i want to talk aboutfirst some issues i had with this launchsome issues i had with gym sharkand just kind of like clear in the air alittle bit because this was not a normalgymshark launch where you go onyou get things they may or may not sellout and then you're on your wayno no this was not so if you did nottake part in this launch and you don'tknow what i'm talking aboutbasically apparently this launch wasprojected to not sell out for weeksand it sold out at least on the us sitewithinprobably about 10 minutes first of allthe collection actually opened up threeminutes before the projected launch timeor sorry the announced launch timeswhich doesn't seem like a big deal butpeople were already starting to buythingslong story short things got reallyquickly people who expected to get itemsended up not because the website wouldcrash and kick them off which happenedto methey had different stock for differentcountries so the usand canada sold out like really quicklybut the rest of the world site and theuk sitestill had like sizes in everything rightafter the launch whitney was reallyupset about this and she posted on herinstagram storyclearly upset at the situation she wasin tears it was like honestlyheartbreaking because like this isn'ther faultand jim shark said they will not berestocking but there's more to come fromwhitney so i think she's releasing moreitems coming upbut i don't think these same items arelaunching again which is kind of sillybecause a lot of people still want thembut gymshark makesweird marketing choices these are madeon purposei think it creates hype around productsflash forward a few days laterthe items magically come back in stockon the canada website and then a fewdays after thatthey magically came back in stock on theus website which means i was able to geta few more items it took over a weekfor my first package to come which waslike a long time it didn't ship like fora long time either which is weird forgymshark because usually they're like onitmy second package actually came in likethree business days so that was prettygoodokay something i want to talk abouttalked about this in my instagram storybut i want everyone to know that none ofthis is whitney's faultgymshark has had multiple launches wheretheir website has had issues it hascrashed completelyit's had a lot of problems and theyrefuse to fix it and there's literallyno excuse for thislook at facebook they have a websitethat supports millions of users at everymomentand gymshark has maybe a few million onat this launch timeand they can't handle it there are webplatforms that are robust enoughto handle lots of people and gymsharkrefuses to invest in that and the factthat they told whitneythat this stock would last for weeksmakes me really upsetbecause having taken any basic levelstatistics coursei could have told you that the amount ofstock they purchasedwould have sold out first of alleveryone knew this was going to be thebiggestgym shark launch in a long time likethere was no mystery it's a whitneysimmons she's hugethe items were really cute and whitneyhas millions of followers and gymsharkhas millions of followersher followers are loyal there's noexcuse for this selling out so fastbecause they knew they knew how muchstock they needed gym truck is a bigcompanythese companies know these things likethis is so important to theirfunctioningfor them to know how much product tomake yet they did not make enoughthat wasn't by accident people my theorythat they intentionally didn't makeenough so only a few people could get itit's limited edition it creates hypegymshark loves to sell out quickly whichi hope they just eventuallyend up fixing this because if they havecustomers that want their products idon't know why you wouldn't wantmore customers wearing your products idon't know all the details behind theconsumer psychology that they're doingbut it's something else okay it is notwhitney's job to do market data researchand figure out how many productsof these items to produce like it's nother job she was justdesigning it with gymshark and she'slike the face of the brand it's not herfaultanyways now we're going to get to thereview i just wanted to say that this isunsponsoredit is unbiased whitney is one of myfavorite influencers butit is very important to me on thischannel to be honest with you guys so iwill be giving my full honest feedbacki have already worn the set to the gymso i will insert some clipsthroughout the video of how i felt abouteverything i also want to say that forthe first timei think ever on gymshark they used moreinclusivemodels on the actual website for thestock imagesso the models were actually size likemedium to large which is very unusualfor gymshark usually it's always smallso i think that really does help peoplewho are those larger sizesto figure out is this going to look goodon me like what is going to fit meso i think that was probably whitney'sdoing so i think that's really awesomethat they're starting to do thatbecause not everyone buying gym clothesis a size small okay also i just checkedthe gym shark website and they're nolonger displaying this collectionso it must have completely sold out okaythe first thing i'm going to talk aboutisthe leggings so these leggings are a 7 8length so the leggings are madeof a polyamide elastane blend basicallywhitney made herself a pair ofgym shark lululumina lines we all knowwhitney likes gymshark but we also knowthat whitneyloves lululemon even more probablybecause she wearsa line pants way more than she wears gymshark and that's just the tea peoplethat's that's the talright so here are the leggings thewaistband looks super small this is theextra smallbut it did end up fitting me and thewaistband actually like isn't badso it does have a little seam at the topof the waist but it's not an elasticthere's no like actual elastic that ican really feeland it doesn't like squish you in sothat you're like spilling over at thetop it's actually a pretty flatteringwaistbandit feels really just like tight aroundthis region and it really just holds youup very well so yeah we have a highwaist we have this little gold bardetailand i'm going to insert a photo of oneof my friends on instagramlike as soon as she put on theseleggings the little gold bar likeimmediately like ripped offso i think that might have just beenlike a one-time thingbut i'm just saying like there have beensome quality issues there's this reallycute littlebreathable detail in the back here myfavorite part is that the seams on thebuttare slightly curved so it just reallyenhances that booty she does have hersignature it's a beautiful day to bealive on the insideso it's on the inside of the leggingsand then on the outside of a lot of theother itemsokay here's the fabric as you can tellit is brushedand it is like super super soft but ifeel like it's a little bit offfrom a line still i don't know what itis but it definitely isincredibly stretchy like the fact that iwas wearing an extra smalland it didn't restrict me in any wayduring like deadlifts or squatsthat's i'm on board there is no frontseam but there is a back seam so you cankind of pull it up your booty a littlebit give a littleenhancement to the butt but no frontseam means no camel toethere's a slightly extended gussetcrotch but nothing crazyand they are a true seven eighths lengthso i'm filming this as i just got thefirst package yesterday which tookforever whatever um and i got these bothin extra smallthe top in the leggings your girl is notusually an extra smalland it honestly fits just fine like thewaist isn't cutting into me too muchit's not restricting my motion like atall i'm gonna go do a littleleg workout in these and i usually sweatthe most on leg daysso we'll be able to see if they're sweatproof okay so just got back from the gymand as you can see by the little clip itook it's not very sweat proofi was already like i know like i sweat alittle bit from my pets but i'm not likethe sweatiest of all sweaty peoplelike i do sweat as a normal person butyou know what i mean um we got some pitswet immediatelyso i took the top off i didn't actuallyget any sweat marks on the actualleggingsdidn't get any sweat marks here therewas a little bit of a sweat mark in thecrotch but i'm not gonna show youbecause of all the creeps who may or maynot be watching this butit stayed on really well um it justcollected a tonof lint like i showed i'll insert alittle clip likeany kind of lint that was around it goton these like it got on like reallya lot there's still some lint left overyeah there's still definitely some linthere but i diduse my hip band or like little glue bandand it didn't fuzz up the leggings sodid stay sturdy to thatthey also didn't fall down very muchbecause this waistband is just reallynice and holds it upso okay so here are the leggings i amwearing these in a size smalland honestly i think i like the smalls alittle better than the extra smallsa small is my normal size so i think mysizing recommendationis to stick with your normal size theextra smalls i had a lot of troublegetting the waistband over my waistbecause this waistband doesn't have alot of stretch to itbut because it doesn't have a lot ofstretch to it it actually provides agood amount of compression in the waistbut this compression is only at likethis part of your waist so if you'relooking for a legging with lower tummycontrol this probably won't be itthe whole legging in general i would sayis a very light compressionvery similar to the luminant linescomparing them to a lines i think thefeel of the fabric is very similarit's also super super stretchy and notrestricting at all just like a linesbut a lines do not have a seam at thetop of their waistband they also don'thave any compression in their waistbandso i do actually like that these whitneyleggings have this compression at thetop because it kind of just sucks you ini don't feel like it stays up super welllike i think it could stay up a littlebetter which is why the extra small isnicei love the gold band i think it's supercute a little more sophisticated thanthe regular gym trick logo it's superflattering on the butt i think thatthese little booty seamsdo such a good job so definitely high onthe booty scale the seams also comewell above my butt so there's no cuttingoff of the booty coming on herei really love this little perforateddetail and i just think it's reallyunique to not have the front seam that'sanother difference from a lines a linesdo have a front seam so they can giveyou camel toethese are really not going to give youany camel toe in terms of length theyare just like a little bit short on mebut like they are supposed to be a seveneighths length sothey're just kind of like a long caprion me to be honest we're gonna come downherei had a few people message me sayingthat like these leggings really weren'tmade for people above 10body fat and they just felt like becausethe fabric is sothin and it doesn't have any compressionthat it wasn't really doing them anyfavors in terms of celluliteand just like holding them in so if youdo have cellulite and you do likeleggings with some compression i don'tknow if i would go for thesemaybe in the black because they won'tshow the cellulite but i don't thinkthese are cellulite friendly leggings atleast from what people have told mei personally don't really have a lot ofcellulite so i'm not a good one to tellbut i mean it's flattering on me but ialsoi also don't really have cellulite asyou can see with the waistband herewhen waistbands are too tight i do getthem kind of digging into meand i just don't really feel like thisis like really making meyou know it's not like creating rollsit's just holding me in so i think iactually really like this waistbandthis is the extra small as you can seethe waistband is a little tightersnatches me in a little more buthonestly these leggings are so stretchythere's still no restriction in a sizedown and i feeltotally fine like squatting andeverything so i really like theseleggingsdue to their flexibility the waistbandthough because it doesn't have a lot ofstretchwas hard to get on over my butt but nowthat they're onit's totally fine and the extra smalllastly we have the hot fire pink orwhatever it's called in a size mediumdefinitely just like a little bit ofroom in the waist for me so it wouldn'treally hold me up very wella teeny bit of extra fabric around thecrotch but honestly the main issue hereis just the waistband the rest of theleggings are so stretchyi think the sizing is honestly probablypretty similar just because it likehas someone stretch so i think if youhave a smaller waist i might go for yoursize downand if you have kind of like a littlemore weight in the mid sectionmaybe size up but you're probably goingto be fine with like your normal sizehonestly i like my size small[Music]i also got the sports graph and thesports brows made of the samesuper soft material as the leggings ithas a little cutout detail in the frontthat's pretty subtle so it's not goingto like show any crazy underboobthe signature it's a beautiful day to bealive going up the left shoulderand then in the back it has a cutelittle cut out ringwe will see if this like hurts my backor anything but it should be betweenkind of like your shoulder blades so itshouldn't really affect anything i likethat the gym shark logos are a littlemore subtle on thesebecause sometimes gymshark can be alittle crazy with the logos like at theflex leggingsbut um but yeah this seems really cuteon mei just feel like the sports bra it's notreally showing this little thing downherealso i feel like you will get someunderboob sweat in this sports brabecause they're not super sweat proof idon't know how i feel about thislittle like gold bar being on the sidehere i think it could have been likeright there or something i just feellike it's a little weirdi think the back is super super cutehonestly i don't even feel this littlegold barlike i don't think it's hurting me inany way and i think you'd be totallyfine working out in iti haven't heard anyone have any problemswith that specifically i'd give it asolidlight to medium support it's not supersupportive because the fabric is so softbut it's actually a little more supportthan i figured you can kind of seethe cup pads in it but it's not too badso yeah i think that there's definitelya little squishing going on in thesports bra but i don't feel likesuper compressed or like really tightthe small on me is my normal size and ithink this is a good fit so i would staytrue to sizeit is giving me a little bit of cleavagehere which is nice but it's not anythingcrazyand i think the straps are a nicethickness and because they come in alittle bit in the backyou don't have to worry about the strapslike falling off they stay on reallywell the band is also really comfortablehere and the fabric in general is reallysoft so i don't think you're going tohave any chafing issuesso i think this is a solid medium-ishsupport comfortable sports brai also got the long sleeve crop top in asize extra smallthis top again is made of the samematerial super super softsubtle gym shark logo on the back belowthe neck it also has the gold bar on thebackand one detail that i really like aboutthis is they added this little likemesh layer to the bottom so it kind ofjust peeks out like underneath the shirtthose same little perforated detailsthat the leggings had are onthe crop top too kind of towards theribs and thenthey have long sleeves and a little ummore little mesh detail at the bottomit's a beautiful day to be aliveis on the cuff of the sleevehere is the long sleeve crop top iactually think it's really flatteringand i really like this little sidelittle pokey through guys you canactually see some of thebeautiful blue sports brown wearingunderneath through the holes i think themesh detailing is really cuteand i just have a few problems with it iam wearing it in an extra smallit doesn't feel too tight though but ijust feel like it's reallytrying to ride up a lot like every timei raise my armsi feel like i'm risking exposure of thesports bra which i just didit also shows major pit sweat becausethis isn't very sweat proofthe sleeves are also i know i think theywere meant to be extra longbut i'm pretty tall i'm five nine andlike i still have some gathering in thesleevesso i don't know i think the sleevescould be a little bit shorterand you can just like see the sports brapoking out in the backlike i just think this top needs to be alittle longerso we can actually cover what'sunderneath it so yeah i think the top iscute it's comfortablebut it's super cropped and it shows asport for underneathsleeves are a little long and showssweat so i'm not a huge fanand lastly i got the sweatshirt i waskind of expecting the sweatshirt to bemade of the same materialas the leggings but it's kind of justregular sweatshirt materialit's actually like not super soft oranything so it's a little bitdisappointing because i was expecting itto be super softyou have the whitney simmons gold bar uphereyou have drawstrings up at the top ofthe sweatshirt the sleeves are supposedto be extra long so i know some shortergirls are kind of complainingbut they do have also like these littlecuffs at the end which i don't know howi feel about the cuffs at the end of thesleeve like i don't think i really likethat i think it looks kind of weirdbut they're there little mesh at thebottom of the sleeve as well and therealso is a drawstring at the bottom ofthe actual like cropped hoodiewith the mesh again as well and last butnot leasthere's the sweatshirt so i kind ofthought that it would be like a littlemore likecropped and go to the top of theleggings because if i'm walking into thegym i don't know like it's just like alittle bit more than i would like toexpose of my stomachi kind of just wish this went right tothe top of the waistband maybe it's justbecause i'm talland i have a long torso but just forlike you taller ladies it might not goall the way to the top of your leggingsso yeah the sleeves were madeintentionally long so that you could putthe little drawstringthere i don't really like how these hangoff the edge but i actually think it'skind of cute to have like the littlelike poofy sleevesso not too bad this definitely feelslike a more athletic material sweatshirtif you were expecting the kind ofsweatshirt with that super super softlike brushed interior this isn't it soyeah it's definitely morei don't know it's probably better forthe jam that it isn't one of the superfuzzyones but still peach i don't want tohold her too close to me so i get catforgot this but peaches hime girlso this bottom part also ties down whichkind of makes it a little too short forme i just i don't know if i'm throwing asweatshirt i just don't really like itto be super cropped so it's a little toocraft for me but if you like cropsweatshirts i honestly think it's reallycuteso yeah it also has a little hoodie inthe back and it's kind of hard to tellin the black butyeah so i think it's cute it's just notpersonally for me all

[Music]youhey what's up guys it's bad August fromlegends of aesthetics calm I know it'sthe holiday season now we just haveBlack Friday Cyber Monday and there aretons of sales going on right now a lotof you guys have on your Christmas listthings like rave and nice leaves and ofcourse things like doom shark clothingfor those of you who are getting thesefor the first time rave and these themesI'm going to show you real quick justhow I think it's best to take care ofthese bad boys for those of you who areexperienced with these what happensusually is you start wearing these youknow you put these on and then over timeusually pretty quickly you startnoticing these smell like utter crapthey stay end up smelling disgusting andyou start washing them and then afteryou wear them once or twice they alreadysmell disgusting getting into thishorrible cycle of kind of hating thesebut kind of loving them because of howmuch you like wearing them while yousquat and stuffso first of all I think the best way toaddress the smell issue is to completelyavoid it and to do that I say just wearlong pants like the ones I'm wearinghere these Jim shark track pants or in asize medium right here they fit mereally well I could probably squeak itto a size small a size large of course Icould also fit in but it's a little bittoo big for mesize medium about five foot six and halffive seven hello wearing some long pantslike this or compression pants orwhateverI personally noticed has reduced thesmell that these end up creatingdrastically not only that but they alsoaid to how comfortable my legs just feelon my leg days so these were the firstmain step in making my knees feel reallygood just feeling really in the zonereally comfortable on my squat days butalso adding in these long pants my Swandeadlift days have also increased justhow good I'm feeling and I feel likethey've benefited me at leastpsychologically and of course when itcomes to lifting any single littlebenefit you can get you probably want totake if you take this seriously sonow we're on the next step and that'sputting these bad boys on because I'venoticed that a lot of people have beendestroying their their herethey've been destroying their Nike pantsor their Reebok this or their CrossFite'en pantsit's really important for you to putthese on correctly so that you'lldestroy the expensive clothing youprobably just bought so really quicklyI'm going to show you what people dowrong okay so they will go ahead putthis on pull it up to their knee like soand then go ahead and pull this downwhat that does is for some of the pantsout there it might rip it somewheremight rip it and you don't want that youwant to rip the brand-new pants forparents of scotch and your girlfriendjust got you that be all that so guyslet's get it right the first time aroundfirst step pull your pants up justslightly pull them up a little bit sothat there's a little bit more above theknee area there we go you'll notice thatthere's still plenty you know my anklesare really showing and I pulled my pantsup these are really flexible like thatokay next step go ahead and put this bumon like that now what you want to do ispull both the pants as well as the kneesleeve down to your ankle I'm going todo that now it's as simple as justholding the pants in place while pullingup your knee sleeve and granted theseare ray-ban these sleeves these arms youknow the other brands out there that maybe even tighterthis also is a knee sleeve that fits mereally well this is a large well we'reat a medium or a small up I was tryingto really uh you know kind of gear up mylifts um and this would be harder to dothis but since this fits me rails reallyeasy to just keep his pants here andpull them up into place do the samething for the right side real quick andeventually get really fast at this justlike that and I'm going to radio squatit's really crucially follow these twosteps for maximum comfort as well astaking care of your equipmentyour pants and there we go all ready tosquat now let's do it they're havingguys that's how I recommend using yourrayban knee sleeves over your pants becareful when you put your pants on thatway you don't have to constantly bewatching these because they won't bestinking up every other session Ipersonally I don't think I've everwashed this pair right here if I did itmight have been once because Idon't let a friend borrow it maybe buthonestly no these larges right here I'vehad these about six or so months becauseI lost my old pair I think left it indifferent country and I haven't Ihaven't washed these once I have a washthese in over six months it might beclose to a year who knows but it's beena really long time I haven't washedthese and they still smell incrediblethat's because I've been wearing theselong pants underneath my sleeves plusthese long pants also make me feel evenmore comfortable my legs feel evenbetter for my squatting my deadliftinglet's just say okay you end up having touse some shorts gone long pants you onlygot one pair of these or whatever youknow wear your shorts you create thisstench literally just create it justcomes out of nowhere once you startwearing these directly onto your skindirectly on your knees it just comes outof nowhere and it stinks it's bad itjust gives a worse every single sessionand then you wash anyways like I saidthe best way I think is probably just toput it in your sink fill up with somewarm hot water warm water and just putsome logic church and in there you knowmix it up a little bit and then just letit set in your sink for a few hours andthen run water over it and make sure youget all the detergent out I let it airdry overnight or however long my dateokay guys hope you enjoy this videoenjoy your new gear doing your newray-bans new belts your new Jim sharkgear your new loa gear whatever might bemake sure that you take care of yourstuff so you can use it in a long runthank you for watching this video giveme a thumbs up leave a comment I'll seeyou guys in the next one peaceyou,26,UCYvInCvFq9mYzn6YsB5zsZQ,Matt Ogus,109,50,0,841,"['deadlifts', 'LoA', 'Legends',

you i believe it's more quitedominant versus conventional is moreglutes and directly towards the lowerback because right now my lower back issore and i notice i need to startputting a belt on when doingconventional because before when i dosumo everything's good all the way up to295 guys that woke up to before doingthis you know clean it up my bruvaeverything ripped up the ball pein haikualright

notboom real my bad because i told her tobuy it but then they close so she got methis basically come in Vietnamese iscalled rice and thalamus it's like therice is broken in half let me pick it upto show you guys see the rice is not inits not complete sorry um anywaysbasically this is a tradition in thecell i believe so stop moving on wherethey make the rice right now some of therice during the process that they arebroken down by accident so when they'rebroken down like that instead of wastingthem people use them for this type ofdish this is actually tofu wrapped withshrimp paste or whatever and then it befriday so tofu shells on the outsidecrunchy shell just can't wait anywaythis is grilled fish because i love growfresh you see people get them we meetwith ya fish sauce withsome chili

eventually got mygym buddy to spot me I'm trying to trainhim still you know get him to be wherehe wants he's actually 30-somethingyears old a lot older than I am so wejust taking stuff slowly sure I'm onweight ok so this one is actually 135 +10 on each says 155 165 mm hmm not badthey had bid went up to a plate in the25 I don't know if I recorded thoughwellsure for maybe like three rats I believeI'm trying to have that arch you guysprobably see it in my next video Don myrest day I went against on a chatsession I really chest with my compoundlifts you know like that live some benchpresses and military press or you knowOHP what you call it decided to switchthings up normally as you can see on myold blog I do Ches Ches I believe is thechest dumbbells there you go I lost mytrain of thoughts right now dumbbellpresses write after write that today youknow might as well do some incline hemashrink the thing about this isthat the rubber grip as you can see isfalling off of the of the iron handlebaror get a handle so at some point I thinkthis clip I'm not sure ok yeah so I washolding on to what I thought would be afull grip but it's actually not becausewe're slipping off so I'm only holdingup like barely half of what's left atthe bar so I can't get my last you knowset in there and as you can see I fix itI didn't think that would go back in byused 10 pounds plate just a hammer itback and their works and as you can seeright there push the same weight that'sa 25 25 and a 5 so 55 total you can seejust work to a failure y'all and thenback to decline dumbbell presses for 50pounds going from eight to ten reps Iknow let's you know let's face thedumbbells with the faded letters orfaded words to the camera just to trollyou guys on how much I'm benching yeahthe only problem I have with these iswhen you let go of the dumbbells you seein my next few clipsyou know this was fine with this one yousee how this dumbbells and stuff rightthere on the right I tend to not drop ityet because it's only 60 pound I canpull it up but what comes like 70 y/o orI haven't got up to 80 I'm not gonna lieabout that only 70 I think when we've 75I got up my game too I gotta startheavier yeah I can't just keep startingwith like 50 start with like 55 nexttime or something you can see right herejust you know working two failures andthat's that's as far as I'm gonna gowell I did drop it anyways this is 70this someone who actually drop it I didprobably six to eight reps you can see Iclean up everything around me so I candrop it but just pay attention to thelast moment in this clip well I'm aboutto drop it and then my head was upsidedown there was a figure walking by and Iwas afraid that he would walk right nextto me because I don't want the dumbbellsto drop on him watch right here andthere you go I'm about to drop it andthen he walks by like oh you bet yaand then we're back to doing someincline dumbbell flyes I used to do alittle bit like lighter maybe like a 15or 20 so I can get that full stretch butI thought but I was watching like yousay that my elbow is kind of bent but Iwas watching Christian guzmán GuzmanGuzman whatever video and the way he didit was he was actually doing 3035 andthen he bent his elbow a little bit likeright now to get that full stretch orfull um you know force on the chest andI feel like working so i was able to winour way up to 30 pounds this is actuallyone of those that I that me my gym buddyneed to do a lot more cocoa sure the baris an easy bar 35 poundsthen we add a five pounds on east sidein the past I have gone up to 10 poundsbut I start putting pressure on my elbowjoint so maybe I'm doing wrong maybe youknow my tricep is still weak for that Istill have to work on dips was doingthat for a good while until my shoulderstarted hurting when I do dips so Iguess I have to get back on it soon cuzto me that's kind of like a rawshrinking and I love raw string becauseI don't rely machine I just rely on freeweights a lot and doing dips is morelike your body weights and you got moreweights you know I mean send me fourpull ups do that too moving on tooverhead rope tricep extension rootingfor eight to ten reps increase weighteach time i remember back then I used todo this thing where you would raise thecable all the way to the top and then Iwhich is pull forward and leave forwardbut in this one I have the cable set upat the bottom and then just pull therope straight up I feel a better stretchcomparing to the other one you know thatthe sucky part about this is that when Idon't have my earphone then I talk Itend to breathe into a mic it's not likeI wanted to but you know I just got totry and keep it closed so the phonewould capture all the sounds and plusit's like really late right now justtrying to you know save this video haveto sound in there and then just you knowjust save it just say that y'all make itto you know a video clip before I couldupload it and then i'll upload it in themorning when i wake up but as you cansee right here this is some more ropetriceps extension to me i think the Ropeserve as and more of an accessory than amass builder so it's more like shapingso i just go light and then just feelsqueezed except for this one here i wasgoing beast mode when was I yo you knowI'm gonna do one for front camera and Isaid yeah I'm sure you guys see tune andI hope you guys

print and no moreprints so I'll let you know if thathappens from me kind of lounging aroundthe house because I find that reallyannoying with tracksuit bottoms so lookat that like series pink or orange to myfavorites really nice there are properliquid running shorts because thebicycle shorts aren't as flattering onme because I thought I feel like I'vegot huge legs so when I really bicycleto think through a bit of unflatteringwell then so today I'm just gonnaquickly take you through the whole newJim shark female line so as you can seeI'm currently ordering some of the newstuff and I've seen it on like jerseysand Kat and Nicky's and Instagram and myown Instagram we've all got from youcash we got sent out of it early just sowe could try it out see what we like andthen hit you guys off with our ownaffiliate links and I just got so afterthis video you'll see in the descriptiondown below an affiliate link to the gymchat website where you can purchase allthat you see on my video plus a 10%discount using Lanie 10 so just rememberto use that code cause if you want tosee me at the Xbox you need to use oneof my code so here we gothis is new stringer it's kind of like agirl's stringer so as you can see it'slike a mesh detail at the back let'sjust show you that it's like a meshdetail at the back and then it's kind ofa heavier material on the front thenthis comes in a variety color as it isquite local at the sides but it is anice cut on the front and this is like agray with a coral color and there are afew other colors but them all here I'lltake you through my basket of goodies sowe have it here in a pink with a backblack contrast and again mesh back blackwriting and all of the new stuff theyall kind of come in a variety colors sowe've got our coral our bright hot pinkand we've gotkind of gray colors and then a nice mintgreen and then you've got accents ofkind of grays and blacks going throughand the new trucks bottoms and tracksuittops so you can literally make up anentire outfit so go through the websitesee what things you want to match yourput mix and match them and I'll take youthrough as much as I can show you thevariety that there is so we have thesetanks and we have the main the pink thecoral there's also a white one with themints that picks up on the mint greenthat's coming through in the new lines Ireally do like the back of them so asyou can see it's a nice small coming inquite closely nish at the back so shewon loads your back so if you want toshow off your back and again quiteloose-fitting so what I would probablydo and what I've done is either tie itup or took it into my leggings when I'mtraining I don't really like things likekind of ruching around but it has thatnice airy feel I've worn it training ithasn't gotten all sweaty around and letsthe air breathe through your clothes sowell so we've got this and then we'vegot training tops so they have twodifferent types of training bra comingout so this is one of them and as youcan see it's the coral and then it has acriss cross back so this and it's verythick band on the bottom and as you cansee no nipples so there's padding inhere that is good for me because youknow Lanie on her nips so it really isprotecting and bounce up and down quitegood support so you could wear thisrunning and some of the old regime shockhere there wasn't as much support inthem so this definitely there's moresupport now this is kind of a lightersupport and it has just a regular eraserback again hot pink and the coral orangecolor and it doesn't have the padding init so not as much as was coverage thishas nothing on the front and just thegym shark on the band this is the gymshark band and it has the gym shark logoon the front that's the pink then wehave the criss crossin the Mint's and carl so again this ispicking up two colors so you can kind ofmix and match this in with a lot ofdifferent outfits very I know there'sone more yes here it is the gray and themint so again this is just the racerbackso we've got two colors in the racerbackand two in the criss cross back Ipersonally prefer the criss cross backbecause it gives me more support andmore coverage and I don't feel asexposed in the gym but this again andI'll just try it off you guys as you cansee there's a little bit less coveragebut and it does have a nice neck it'snot too high and not too low so you'renot showing off too much cleavage in thegym but you're still nice racerback andagain it's just from mixing and matchingyour outfits for the gym we want to beall like matching it all up so we've gotthe tanks we've got the training brasnow onto the bottom half here's ohhere's another tank so we have it in themint-green as well it's got a good fewvarieties in that and an orange so weactually have like five yeah we've gotlike five colors in the tank so we havethe green orange and pink grey and thenwe've got the white one as well so thenone of my favorite new things which theyhaven't done before is really nicehoodie these are oh my lord so cozycomment winter oh they're just so cozyas the boys almost had the hoodies andnow we do so nice pocket in the frontthey are like so super soft and cozy andagain you're picking up and a fewdifferent colors we have it in the mintgreen but my favorite by far is thisit's theCarl hoodie now it's not just coralthough as if you look very closely Idon't know it's gonna pick that up butit's like an organic so it kind of haswhite flecks going through it and thenas the black Jim shot across the frontit also comes in black with a quitejunior cross front and then we have anice simple gray with black Jim Jackthese are like a comfort fit thoughbecause this is extra small and thatit's like nice and roomy on me so if youwant if you normally go for a small andyou want a quite tight go for the extrasmall but these are a comfort fitthey're not a fitted fit and they havenice or just you know little things likethe cuffs like that cuff is really niceand just not too tight it doesn't havelike the little thumb holes which I kindof find annoying so I really like thishoodie nice toggles even as like the JimShack on the toggle so cozy cozy andthis is called the signal HT pulloveryou got that then we have the new zipthrough so these aren't if you know themen's line they've had these zippers fora while the girls have the regular andsubdues with no hood now we have a hoodso get nice long cuffs so not the shortlittle edged cuffs it is a proper longcuff and this is a more fitted fit againeverything I'm wearing is size extrasmall I'm at the moment a size six andI'm quite petite and I'm gonna find fourone so if you are a bit taller you mightwant to go up with still slim you mightwant to go for a small I am only fivefoot one I am quite petite I'm a sizesixI weigh eight stone so just take that inconsideration when you're orderingbecause all that I'm wearing is extrasmall I find that the bras are justabout fitting I probably could wearsmall either so if you are a bit biggerin your boss like I'm a 32 double D so Ihave the fake boobies so if you arelooking for something thatthat's a bit more room in it maybe go asize up and everything else though Ithink extra small fitting me pretty goodso here we have and again this is thezip pocketit's a stretchy material now all of theitems are have like a little bit ofelastic in them so there is a little bitof stretch in them but again this comesin this nice gray so it's a dark a darkcharcoal and black sleeves we also haveit in again the nice coral and lightgray arms with the white accents on itwe have it in blue so they'reintroducing a new kind of a blue colorin the blue the kind of I suppose it's ablue a charcoal color and then again ithas the white accents and then you'llsee what goes with these as well becausein the whole range and then we also havebeen mint green I think yeahmint green with grey so the mint greenand again all these it's like thecreation outfits for you it's like awhole ensemble you

but as you could see heclearly states that he works with Jimsharp all right so that tells us thisJim shark orders our apparel from Chinathey order it from China for very cheapcosts let's go to this person here thismanufacturer let's go to their websiteor the distributor site off of Alibabaso we go to Alibaba comm let's go aheadand look for let's put in stringersbecause that's what they refer to themas so here he is number one right hereso we'll pull up his his factorydistributor site here okay appears theywere established 2004 they have 51 to100 employees and then total revenuewith 1 to 2.5 million a year that'sgoing to find their products alrightlet's go and look at the t-shirts andlet's see if we could find anythingfamiliar what you'll see here is you'llsee a lot of things that look familiaryou might see them being sold to forever21 if there are women's a pairdo Lululemon through maybe other peoplewho have their gym apparel ship from outof out of country alright we're going totake a look and see if we find anythingthat looks familiar here that we'll beable to use as a fantastic example andhere we have it right herefantastic so everyone knows what thislooks like that's Jim sharp all right weknow we can routine matías wear ityou've seen a lot of other people wearclothing like this the hodgetwins againthey have a lot of people who aresponsored athletes who help promote themlet's go ahead and click on this and goto this one garment here all right sowe're looking at between the six to ninedollars a piece and that is a minnow orthe quantity or moq of 300 pieces allright now they always give you the lowerend of the price if you're buying more Isuspect that this six to nine dollars apiece is actually a little bit lower ifyou're buying at the quantity thatsomebody like Jim shark would buy allright so let's go ahead and go with thislet's go ahead and assume that Jim sharkis going to buy this vest here thisshirt will just say a thousand pieces ofthem alright and let's go ahead and usethis one article clothing to encompassmultiple articles of clothing we justwant to kind of find an average sopretend we'll just say they bought athousand pieces of clothing or shirtsdifferent types of search from thismanufacturer alright and they were ableto negotiate the lower end of the priceall right so we're talking about sixdollars okay clearly do the math sixtimes three hundred looking at $1,800$1,800 we're going to add on about $200for shipping or so we're looking at$2,000 alright so let's go ahead and dothe math on what they're going to goahead and sell that for let's see if Ican find hereJim sharks company here we go Jim sharkfind their stuff thank youI've actually never worn anything fromJim sharp it looked very comfortable Ihave nothing but good things to sayabout them again I'm using them as anexample because I've dealt with theirdistributor and I'm able to help peopleunderstand a little bit more of the costassociated with buying apparel thisright here looks like the same exactshirt just different color variant andplacement of the logo itself let's takea look with the back of this looks likeand see if we can confirm okay Jim sharpapparently doesn't want me to have aback picture I don't know why they woulddo that that's very interestingbut we're going to assume because of thelook here that this is the same multipleclothing for 1999 in not US dollars solet's go and convert that to US dollars19 okay what if you can use four dollarsokay30 dollars Jesus okay so this is aperfect example of a very highpercentage of profit so we're looking atabout $30 here $30 for this shirt allright we found out over here they paidabout $6 for that shirt and again Isuspect this lower award and give themthe benefit of the doubt all right solet's do some simple math here so ifwe're looking at $30 divided by or theysay 6 again we're looking at five sowe're looking at about five hundredpercent profit now I wanted it to be alittle bit more mathematicallycomplicated net but we'll settle withthis here five hundred percent profit onthis right here all right so let's goahead and say about a thousand units ofmultiple article clothing what we'regoing to say they're all the same pricehere so they're making the samepercentage of profit all right they'reinvestingagain we rounded up to about $2,000 allright because it was about 1800 for thesix times 300 and then 200 for shippingthey're going to be paying more forshipping if they're buying multiple butjust for the actual price per unit let'sjust go ahead and look at it this wayokay so they have 1,000 pieces that theybought for of course nice and simpleeasy math six at six thousand dollarsright but they had that same thousandunits I wouldn't say they sold it for 30per unit we're looking at $30,000 sowe're gonna subtract the $6,000 so youguys are visual and they made $24,000right off of selling one thousand unitsfor this price here so the percentage ofprofit is huge for a company like Jimsharp this is just one article clothingexample based on very very basicinformation that we have given on thewebsite again I suspect the pricing perunit is going to be lower because it'ssupplies so much to them or othercompanies like them but this is just anidea of what Jim sharks making on salesand once you start looking at how much acompany's profiting compared to how muchthey're spending on would you say theirinventory being articles of clothinghere it becomes very disheartening tobuy that company's apparel for instanceI don't buy Lululemon's apparel verymuch if at all anymore because I've seenthe same stuff on websites like this forthe same unit price but then you go tothe store and you're paying 80 to 100dollars for that same shirt with verylittle alterations done to it you'rejust getting a ship from China and thenreselling it alright so I have nothingbut good things to say about companieslike Jim shark so this is not somebodywho was trying to attack them orcompanies like them because a lot ofpeople who make apparel go this routeand this is what they're spending soexpect them to make a profit along thisline alright if they're not and they'rehaving their stuff shipped and madein the u.s. there may be much smallerpercentage of profit overall and sosmart companies like Jim shark are goingto go this route when it comes to makingmoney I hope this helps you guys togiving the idea of apparel sales andwhat kind of money is out there to bemade thanks",26,UCYvInCvFq9mYzn6YsB5zsZQ,Matt Ogus,341,481,0,1083,"['deadlifts', 'LoA', 'Legends',

whats up youtube welcome back to anothervideo can you really went on 90 you knowwithout further introduction you'renowhere first thing first I just want towish you guys a happy holiday seasonmerry christmas and happy new year aswell first things first my tongue thetank restore I don't know why but I gettons of canker sore I bite myself orwhatever I try switching to face so Iguess that was a while a lot of Koreanship in heaven e so my trick is to putalimony I have a little thing on nowright now psycho so we call it liketranquil a similar tranquilizer beenneutralized the effect so it doesn'thurt as much like talk to me a littlebit but yeah I haven't been gyming ahappy I've been off the gym for like twoto two and a half of weeks already so Ilook skinny and stuff butanyways this stuff came home visa iorder from black friday so finally theycame home like about two days ago rightnow sounding filming at for somethingcamp hopefully will happen video out bytonight haven't been squatting so noneof that at all I haven't been to gymwhich is bad I'm not sure about my squadevery day deal so we'll see if we gonnabeyeah so this is a gift from mygirlfriend she secretly got for me thisis a fit bottoms version 2 or taperbottom you in college the color righthere says navy blue white and mediumtoday there you go you can see the colorway right there says you know maybe bluewhite not sure this is really navy withlooks more trouble to me we're going toopen this up in the second I'm wearingthe taper bottom the gray or heathergray color from Jim cot vision to aswell my girlfriend loves it too but shewas that the female version comes withthe zipper on the side that helps a lotso um but this time I'm you know alittle smarter I instead of shippingwith DHL I selected the usps postal sothat came home without being charged bycustoms but I ordered three items willbefore I order like about four or fiveitems and actually got charged by customand I guess dho makes me the heck peopleso we gotta pay VHF 50 bucks just to getit back from custom but anyway wow thisis we got the hoodie no zip hoodiepullover from Jim shark size medium andthe thing that got me fascinated justnow is the 3d stitching church artpoplogo on the chest but real nice I didn'tthink it would be stitching popping uplike this I thought just like a backprint that says Jim shark on the chestabout yeah and then I got this one asure with this call but this is at-shirt with the blue chip truck i'm ina fit of month and i got this for myselfI wanted the blue colorway cuz i loveblue for special royal blue but icouldn't get it was sold out so i gotthis one instead this is the left baragain this is the version to you can seeright here loves bottom this is a sizemedium black I'm gonna open that upright now thing about me is that i'mmost likely and then i'm gonna bekeeping these bags i'm gonna draw themaway so i'll be gentle with them andwhatnot but this is the lux bottomvirgin too i was really skeptical aboutgetting a size one he thought that thatwas barking one right people anyway sowe got the lux bottom version 2 and in ablack hard way like ice men beforei was skeptical about getting a sizesmall versus a medium i'm about fivefoot eight ish close to nine okay and tome medium fits well it's really well Ijust at some point I feel like kind oflengthy so I mean if you can deal withthat then cool but if you can't just goahead and guess I small this is what itlooks like wearing a medium you can seeat the bottom we have all these stats onthere so I'm standing up and you can seeall the stacking and everything so youknow for recommended sizing I would saya medium fits well for anyone above 5 10I guess cuz i'm hype eight ish close atnine and then you see mocha stacking upthe reason why i got medium was becausei don't want to do with something thathurts a lot so there's that factor aswell so I mean definitely get a small ifyou're under 58 or 59 um why do you wantto risk it like I said so I got mediumand uncomfortable I'm gonna try these onin a little bit this is the luxe butimmersion to once again in black andwhite and I comes with the zipper prettycool and then I don't have to versionone but I heard it fits a little bittighter than usual lot of guys wouldcomplain about that I heard some storywith jeff side and crystal bottleespecially jeff side he needed to get acitation large just so it fits well butthis is a lot better construction youcan see on the lace we have a lace capnow and plastic I noticed the cameracasitas hopefully okay so that works andthen you know just details here andthere we got this pretty cool tag madefrom the same material as the pants justlike that Jim trying to be a visionaryyou actually cut that up I leave it onthere comes with this black tag as wellblack on black print with the the iconicJim Sharpie logo and just white stripesour way to the bottom that we got zip atthe bottom as well again I'm going tofilm that we went on these item on onevideo next item we have good lucksbottom in a colorways you can seeright here same as the one I'm wearingwhich is in the navy color like Imentioned before I to me this is morepurple than Navy but make sure both butmore leaning towards purple you can seeright here we have to sync tag is bevisionary in fabric as well Fitz bottomversion to cut with the long attack andsays right here lmn create somethingspectacular with extraordinaryperformance where the blue and whitefont chimchar spell out with the face ofthe shark instead of the whole chaarlogo and we have the same logo on theback

this video explores the four keypurposes of market researchand is supported with real-life examplesof businesses who have conducted marketresearch effectivelyor have faced the consequences of notusing enough market researchto support their decision-making processmarket research is a process used bybusinesses to gain a deeperunderstanding of who their targetaudience iswhat their wants and needs are and whatinfluences their purchase decisions andbehaviorit is used in a wide range of scenariosright from collecting the initial forceof the target market about potentialproducts through to analyzing thecompetitionand the market in general the amount oftimeinvested or budget allocated to marketresearch activitiesvaries between businesses for examplesome businesses may allocate zero budgetwhile others may invest millions ofpounds each yearrather than just acting out of instinctentrepreneurs and managers willundertake market research toidentify customer needs identify gaps inthe marketreduce risk and ultimately make betterdecisionslet's have a look at these core purposesof market research in more detailwith some examples of how famousbusinesses such as applelego and gymshark have used marketresearch effectivelyto increase sales and grow into newmarkets[Music]identifying the needs of customers ispotentially the core purpose of marketresearchwhen conducting market research withtheir target market a business is likelyto focus on factors such asprice quality choiceand convenience with the aim ofcollecting data and feedbackwhich will support the business toprovide their customers with theproducts they wantor need at a price that they are willingto payif a business did not conduct marketresearch it could potentially result inthem investing hundredsthousands or even millions of poundsinto product developmentwhich the market does not want or needlg and sony are prime examples ofbusinesses who failed to truly identifythe wants and needsof customers through market researchafter the highly successful 2009 releaseof avatar 3d in cinemasboth lg and sony launched their own 3dtelevision range to capitalize on thetrendhowever they didn't conduct sufficientmarket research before making thisinvestmentand although the 3d film was a big hitin the cinemas it turned out thatcustomers did not have the want or theneed to view their tv content in 3din their homes this resulted in bothbusinesses eventually discontinuing themanufacture of their 3d tv rangein comparison apple are a prime exampleof a business who'll conduct extensivemarket researchevery single year through their customerpolls programin fact apple spent a record 18.75billionon research and development alone in2020this helps apple to clearly identify thewants and needs of customers effectivelyand even resulted in them diversifyingtheir iphone product range in 2013with the release of the iphone 5c thiswas for customers who wanted an appleiphonebut did not particularly need the highspec or want to pay a premium pricemarket research is also very useful tohelp a business to identifyany gaps in the market a gap in themarket is essentially where there is apotential demand for a productor service which is not currently beingmetwhilst it can be risky for businesses toexploit these gapsit can also be very lucrative if abusiness can firmly place themselvesas the market leader in this gap a veryfamous example of a business whichfailed to conduct sufficient marketresearchand take advantage of a gap in themarket is blockbusterthey were once offered the chance to buynetflix for 50 million dollarswhich would have allowed them to adaptthe business model over time to theonline streaming service we all know anduse todaythis resulted in blockbuster eventuallyfailing as a businessand netflix taking advantage of this gapin the marketwith a market value which is now higherthan disney it reported 194 billiondollarswho by the way have now launched theirown online streaming service to rivalnetflixnamed disney plus another example of abusiness conducting market research tosuccessfully identify a gap in themarketis jim shark co-founder ben francissuggested in a recent interviewthat remembers looking around and notbeing able to find any clothing hewanted to wear for the gymand he believed there was a clear gap inthe marketso with the help of his brother and agroup of friendsthen bought a sewing machine and ascreen printer and started to make gymvests and t-shirts in his parents garagejim sharp was literally born in 2012through a gap in the marketthey started to make bodybuilder veststhat fitted slimmer teenagersbecause most on the market were designedfor older men who had already built uptheir muscle buildeight years later gymshark is now aglobal business valued at over 1.3billion dollars in 2020no matter how much market research yourbusiness conducts it cannot eliminaterisk entirelyhowever it can reduce the risk bygetting market insights and feedbackfrom customerswithin business risk comes in manyshapes and sizesthere are monetary risks associated withinvesting money into productswhich may not be needed by the marketalternativelybusinesses face the risk of losingcustomers or facing public backlashthrough negative press coverage or evenpressure groups if they fail to trulyunderstand the market they operate withita classic example of a business actingwithout conducting sufficient marketresearch firstis the well-known toothpaste brandcolgateduring the 1980s colgate decided toextend their product range from oralhygieneinto frozen foods however they failed toreduce the risk of this brand extensionstrategyand ultimately paid heavily as customersstrongly associated colgate withoral hygiene which unfortunately did notmake their frozen food productsappetizinghad colgate have conducted marketresearch initially they would have foundthis information and either launched afrozen food rangeunder a different brand name or scrapthe venture entirelyeither way they would have reduced therisk save a lot of timeand money[Music]the final core purpose of marketresearch is to help businesses to makebetter decisionswhether this decision be aroundlaunching a new product or servicemaking a change to an existing productor even investinginto a new store location a greatexample of a business utilizing marketresearch to make better decisions islegofor many years lego was seen as a boy'stoyand it was reported that only ninepercent of primary users were girlstherefore lego conducted extensivemarket researchto see if there was a demand in themarket for lego aimed at girlsin fact they conducted a four-year studywhich involved 3500 girls and their mums the marketresearch included analyzing girlsplaying habitsand lots of extensive questioning thisresulted in lego launching a new productrange in 2012named friends which was aimed at girlsthis product range was based on thefoundations of lego's core productsbut included changes to the color of thelego bricks to more vibrant colorsa change to the packaging and they alsoadapted the figures to a bigger sizeto accommodate accessories such as hairbrushes and pursesall of these decisions were based on thefindings of the market researchand the company said it sold twice asmany lego friends sets as it expected towhen the product range first launchedhowever lego also faced criticism fromsome consumer groupswho said it reinforced genderstereotypes having said this profitsrose by 35so you could argue that there wasclearly a demand in the market for thistype of productwhich was supported by their marketresearchso that's it the core purposes of marketresearch explainedbefore you leave it's also important tobe aware that there are two main typesof market researchthat a business can choose from whenconducting market researchthese are known as primary and secondarymarket research methodsprimary market research is conducted orfunded by the businessand includes methods such asquestionnaires focus groups andinterviewswhereas secondary market research isinformation which already existsand includes methods such as internetresearch government reportsand market data once a market researchprocess is completethe results will be shown as eitherquantitative or qualitative dataif you want to find out more aboutprimary and secondary market researchmethodsor

hello my super Europe and welcome I'mpretty exciting I just got some newclothing in the mail and anyone whoknows me my favorite thing in the worldis workout outfits I know reallyunoriginal of whatever I love it and Iknow all of you love it so I thoughtwhat the heck I'm sure you've seen onInstagram or on social media Alf eliteand Jim shark and I just finally orderedthem for the first time and I know I wasa little skeptical just for the fact Ididn't know their size and I didn't knowhow they fit they looked really good onthese beautiful models a little good onme oh this is Chester um he will be ourguest star today's probably simply metbut but so I thought I'd try it on giveyou guys a review today we're doing myginger call I got three things sportsbra pair of spandex and a pair of theirpants I'll show you how they fit kind ofdescribe their material and hopefullyyou like it and unwrap it I will makesure to show you on and then I will alsodescribe the material fit all that kindof stuff so if you go to order it youlike it I will say I am NOT sponsoredand affiliated by any means of thesecompanies the course this is justsomeone who really really enjoys fitnessclothing I buy a lot of Lululemon a lotof Nike so I thought it'd be nice tospread a bit of the knowledge andhopefully you can find sign you enjoyedfrom there these companies so here we gotoday we are doinggucchy yeah pretty excited this justcame in the mail I ordered this book twoweeks ago I did get those pants fromthem a little while ago I will throwthose on this is their new sports braand their new spandex by Jim shark sohere I'll open these upyou can know the use of you so firstimpression let's kind of quote there's abit of padding in them which is nice ifyou're like me and you get a littlenibbly at times material oh I like thatlittle logowell accents always very cute quite sobanded here kind of ruffled a little bitthis is the little stretch oh that'snice and tight so be secure I'm hopingwhich is nice it won't ride up thematerial would be closed honestly morethey give Victoria's Secret like theirsports raw versus a Lulu that's how Iwould describe it I do like how theseare banded and it goes in like this kindof when it lowers like that it can hidethe love handles versus with some bandsthey'll kind of spill over once againvery victorious here it's kind of a bitthicker okay like almost kind of like awonder under I mean you're so interestedyou so interested so I'll try these onand true yet so here are the three itemsI got so these are they're dry scalpfull-length pants and it's slate blue Ibelieve is the color I did actually wantthese in gray but they sold out the dragblue the like slate blue they have isalmost a creation light blue which Ireally likeI don't have anything this or said a lotof great so the material best way todescribe it is very very similar to Loulemon so should this material of theirtops and their wonder unders that's howI would describe it not quite asstretchy a bit less given away which canbe good as well um and then they do havethe mesh once again very similar to Luluyou got pockets on the topis always nice and I find if you haveLulu's mesh pants at all I might have afew pair of them it is very similar itgoes all the way down to the bottom andsee like that and these are bithigh-rise I do like that and they seemto have a bit of a curve so they kind ofgo like that and in so I feel that wouldgo over the love handles and then securegot a waistband like right there whichcan be unflattering and then this littlelogo oh and I got a small on this Iusually wear a size 4 it did fitperfectly I will note if I were to getanother size there I'd be at four sixnot a 2 4 in Lulu and these were tightso if you're like a bear sizing forborderline 6 I might go with a mediumunless you want it really really tightof course taking my thing stretch alittle now the second thing I got wastheir seamless sports bra this is amedium I believe I got I'm sorry this isa small and in there charcoal it's gotsome nice accents you can see it's gotsome roughly and it goes like this andit's got a thicker band right here makesure thicker bad now same one which Ilike because it will keep things inplace I find a bit better and find it'sflattering when they're really thin bandI finally kind of scrunch up and kind ofmake rolls happen so I got a small thisfit perfectly I'll try it on and showyouI wear a 3432 I'm a big B little C keepin mind I do up implants so Imy influence it then elastin of theseair dry sculpt shorts in like a sea blueI think it's a term got a smell in theseas well and these are amazing I'm justgoing to say right off the bat it's notquite a Lululemon material as I saidit's more of a thicker kind of VictoriaSecret if you've seen any of theirmaterials I would associated a bit morebetween that and a cross of Nike versusa Lulu and this is super flattering onhow it like pivots down and let's gamekind of goes over a problem area a lotof us do have so I will try these on andshow you guys to start off is with thepants you'll notice see how they comeand they come above I'm gonna dip injust around the waist which I do like itkind of covers versus is probably aMiriam flattering trait a bit exceptthey're kind of digs into the lovehandle area I go and you know I reallylike it perfectly fits the length of mylegsI have very short legs long torso so Ifind pants that you believe longer methis bit quite nicelyI do feel these are very secure so youknow when you're bending over and stuffwhen working out I feel this one its lipwhich is very nice this is just a littleooh sports braand for the pants and sports rock movieHenry said honest when I first saw thisshorts I was super worried because I'venever had a design like this and I wasworried it was one of those things youlook great on their models not so muchof me and it was just you know becauseever I'm composing this in a way that Ihave to admit these are super flatteringthey're just a bit longer thanLululemon'slike spandex ER I've got the name oftheir shorts like which would go toabout here on me a bit longer so I don'tfeel like when I bend over but that'sgonna fall out but not so long that italmost is like a biker short and a fewangles when I pose it gives me camel toebut I notice that I'm just like walkingaround I don't get that and this is whatI love just like in their pants it justcomes just over your hips just underyour waist and they tapers in here so itkind of adds to village II didn't haveI've quit hourglass shape waist and Ifeel it would add to it if you don't ifyou do have that but if you don't I feelit would almost give you the illusion ofit so I love those and as for the sportsbra as I discussed before it's got athicker band which I feel just keepseverything secure I talked to it for andfake boobs so I don't need muchsecureness but just how it comes evenaround my boob here if I that's a bigproblems for us so she'll 11 actually itcuts off there this comes around andreally covers it and it's not so boobythat it comes here and it's mushy and agirl who does have implants or a bitlarger chest you know I find that a lotof sports wants to get them to fit Isaid if it's smaller than them of boobsover here nicely cars and I feel securein here but it has a little bit ofpadding which is nice you don't get likethe nipples not so much of its like yourboobs are fake because I found theyVictoria Secrets with their padding it'sa little bit too much and so you can allsay like wow that's not your boobs it'sjust likecome out just a little bit right thereand then he's cut a cross pattern Ithink they're just a cool design and Ilove this colorand that's all for this episode thanksfor tuning in I hope you guys got a seaof got to see exactly what Jim

these very clear easy to useuh collection filters i love these atthe topthey're not hidden they're easy theyworki'm very impressed i love that it's abar which leaves way more room for thecollection gridand then what like and because thecollection grid has more room thatallows the images to be biggeranytime you can err on the side of theimages being bigger is a good one 100and all right so i've got scroll down tonew there's newi like their old new badge it's nicecritical hoodie dark green 45i note that they don't sell 3xl again ohi'mi feel very abandoned herewe'll find you we'll find you a 3xlhoodie buddyi don't want to ugh sleeves i get so hotuh all right he's not kidding umi appreciate that you uh i'm on theproduct page they use breadcrumbsi don't want to like breadcrumbs but ihave found consistentlyover and over across all categoriesbreadcrumbs on a product detail page getusedpeople use them to go back to thecollection or the home page whereveruh so on the collection grid oh okay sothis is a question we get a lot in thegroupon the collection grid the top thinghere is this crest hoodieand the crest hoodie is broken out intomultiple colors and each color has itsownimage associated with it and then ohyeah you're right and so if you clickthrough if you click through the red oneit has size and then it has the colorsbut when you clickon the colors on the product page thatis a completely separate product listingso they've split outeach color as its own separate productwe get a lot of questions we get aquestion about that all the time in thegroupoh yeah yeah if you hover over it youcan see it's different lengths i'm surethis is like metafield madness to makethis workthere's like apps that do it oh really ithink but at the same time at like theirscale they could build a private app todo whatever they want yeah or i'm surelike you know they could call toby andbe like we really want this featuremaybe toby's like get out of here iplayed starcrafthe does play starcraft he playsstarcraft the man enjoys starcraftuh interesting way to lay out theproduct photosit is a more editorial style it insteadof thumbnailsit's like three images across a bigimage and then two images across thebottomwe did something kind of like this onadam's polishes and it worked well ireally liked it do you have one with avideothe one i'm looking at does not have avideo clip video looks like thedifferent colorsswitch all right i'm looking at i'llswitch to charcoal marl oh yeah that'llhave oneokay whoa oh[ __ ] okay so i always tell people goshould i hit videothe answer like say no more the answeris yes videolooks professional it looks engagingthis as far as video being executedis truly phenomenal and what's fun aboutit the video starts and end with the guywalking into frame and out of frameso it's got kind of there's like a funum benny hill quality to ithow was it like benny hill uh thatthey're messing with likethe frame you just want to hit thebutton i didn't even hit the buttonthis video was 720p too huh it's hugebut what about their page speed scorewe're not talking about that this weekoh sorryno it's wow that this product pagethis photo layout with a video trulyimpressive and that's really niceoh at the bottom on this one it's got abutton says load more imagesand then it flips the images tosomething else okayif i click them ah all right so then ifyou click an imageit loads in a this really nice light boxbut it has all your thumbnails down thesideso they've gone with an atypical layoutwhich is a risk but they have executedit so wellit entirely mitigates the risk yeah theygot a littleposition sticky going on the form aswellas you scroll down through the imagesyeah that's cool is always therethat's nice that's very this this isvery niceoh yeah it is if i click size guidethey've got a nice size guide relevantto the product tells meoh i could choose between inches andcentimeters umand uh even tells you how to measurethe the size guide is on point and thenunderneath the add to cart buttonit says um it's got after pay and clarkon here two financing optionsinterestinginteresting choice that the descriptionone is closed yeah the descriptiondefaults to closeso they use an accordion menu for thedescription and it'sdescription delivery returns reviews theitem is new that i'm looking at doesn'thave reviewsum it's got a bulleted descriptionwhich honestly i would i would defaultit to openand at the same time like these productsare fairly self-explanatorythese products pretty much like do youthink this looks cool yes no yeahand so the images are the thing thatsells it i don't need to be like okaybut how many arms does the sweatshirthaveyeah right the sweatshirt i think thefont is too small toobecause i'm old yeah oh need my cheatersyeah it's 12 point font it's tinyi would like if i still want to keepthat small look i'd bump it to 14.but my ideal minimum for font size is16.but let's go back to the debate sothere's always a debate in thegroup about whether you should split outvariants by color and make every colorits own producti don't like that but either do i wantit all on one pagejim sharks doing it well yeah but theyalso have a hybrid approachyeah where i can pick the photos likei could choose the other colors from anyof the product listingsthat's the difference and that's why wesay like we'll bundle them togetherbecause you got one listing to promoteand i could flip through the colors allon one pageyeah and so they did that and that theydo have them as all separate productsbut the swatches they still have colorswatches on every product pagethat will lead you to that product yeahand thenby doing that then they also you couldsee all of them at a glance in thecollection gridso they have combined and solved forthis problem entirelyit's very clever all right so i've gonewith an excel i've selected it click addto cartand it's got cute cute little animationto confirm it and then it opens a drawercarti think the animation is nice but youcould skip it just have it open thedrawer cardonce i'm in the drawer cart very minimalnothing to itso there's some opportunity there andyou can add a lock icon to the checkoutpaypal did a case study supposedly thatincreases conversionsum well enhanced you can have the iwould say like they've got this free nohassle 90 day return policythat's a big deal i would like andthat's one line of text i would havethat in the cart draweryeah they can get some upsells on theretoo like buying a hoodieall right i'm gonna click check out bythe time because i

free probably with athreshold for them it's 75 bucks we'rebelow ityeah it's like do you want free but slowor fast but expensiveyeah no this is good i was talking to amerchant this weekwho it does not have a billion dollarevaluationand had um so why are you shipping rulesso complicatedit required a six-page flow chart and myadvice was like this is insaneyou'd wildly simplify this for your sakeand the customersand well clearly jim shark did but allright so my point is like don't givepeople choice paralysis don't tear yourhair out with shippingum simplify it if you can and jim sharkhas done a wonderful example of it hereuh overalli mean this site really with theexception of likethe mega menu could could be polished upwith that one exception the rest of thesite is quite extraordinaryyeah no

[Music]it's time hey guys and welcome back tomy channele today is one of the most requestedvideos have gotten so far a lot of youguys were really concerned that I wasn'tgonna do this video yes you know meyou know I have a track today we arereviewing Jim sharks ultra seamlesscollection this is definitely their mosthyped collection of the summer they'velaunched literally so much in the pastfew weeks that I purchased all of it andthey even had like three extra launcheslike that they launched with this butthey didn't tell anyone about theycouldn't hide it from me so I got thattoo and that review will be up tomorrowso if you don't want to miss anotherbrutally honest Jim shark review makesure to subscribe and bring the belt soyou know when it's happening okay so aswe can see the ultra seamless collectionis a super like bright neon collectionand obviously it was pretty popularbecause I believe all the shorts aresold out which I'm a little surprised isI'm not sure this girl but I did get apair of shorts I got sports bra crop topand all three colors of the leggingsbecause I kind of wanted to know if theywere squat briefs and by kind of I meanreally I heard that the orange was likenot even stand proof from one of myfriends so so these are all like in theregular Jim shark price range around $55for leggings 40 for a sports bra so youcan be paying around $100 for a set Ipersonally love Jim sharks seamlessdesigns I think they're seamless designsare much better than any of theirleggings with I think you need to putthis down now I think their seamlessdesigns have definitely been some oftheir most popular ones in the past andthey've definitely been some of myfavorites than them I feel like otherpeople were a little more excited aboutthis collection than me I do love brightcolors and I think the neon is reallycute but I just really don't likeasymmetric designs I just like they'renot for me I really like symmetry and myactivewear since the sports bra isasymmetric I'm interested to see likehow I'll like itI think the leggings and the shorts lookreally cute hopefully they're flatteringhopefully the squat proof there probablywon't be please make sure to give thisvideo a thumbs up if you like my honestJim shark reviews my honest reviews ingeneral so I know I should keep makingthem alright let's go first we're goingto talk about the ultra seamlessleggingsthese leggings are $55 becoming thislike electric blue color little pinkishred color and the orange okay honestlywas expecting kind of a differentmaterial out of these they are meant fortraining the waistband is a super thicklike double thickness ribbed waistbandhere's the ribbing that it continues tobe ribbed down the side of the leg allthe way to the bottom I don't know whybut I was expecting these to be kind oflike that more like a slick kind ofenergy seamless material but they'rereally not they're really kind of like athick like almost like cotton me likebut still performance material you'renot gonna get pills with this fabricit's not brushed but it's also not thatlike cool to the touch like slicktexture its kind of unique I kind offeel like this is going to feel prettylike heavy weight so it's definitely nota lightweight legging and these do feellike pretty heavy the logo is just afinal stick on and it's also reallysmall compared to most of their logoswhich is kind of interestingwait okay guys there's some tea Jimshark actually put a warning on theirwebsite that said may not appear fully[ __ ] proof when stretched Jim Chuck hasnever posted this on their web site I'vehad some incredibly sheer like eggs fromJim shark let me tell you like theseshears leggings I've ever tried and theydid not post this I guess now they'retrying to be a little more transparentI know alkalete did this with theirrevival leggings but I honestly foundthe revival leggings like pretty swabproof so like I appreciate thedisclaimer because a lot of people don'tfeel comfortable and like a sheerleggings but also like what's this likedeal with like may not appear fullysquat group you either are or you're notsquat proof like I don't know about uphere like you it should just say it issheer but full stretch I just looked upathletes disclaimer athlete says thattheir likings are semi sheer at fullstretch it's much more straightforwardthan may appear sheer I give you an Afor effort in sharkon like trying totell people with its last year but justsaying that it's sheer because now I'mexpecting these are gonna be a littlesheer okay let's try them so I'm notupset with these leggings I do have tosay I already kind of like bent over themirror and you can see my entire buttoncrease all right here they are I lovethe color they're like a super superneon pinkthe waistband is really compressive andreally sucks you in these definitely runtrue-to-size the small fits me perfectlythey're honestly super stretchy and theywere really easy to get onthey really compress you down but alsolike give you a lot of room to movethey definitely feel like a little tightwhen I do this you can see that it'spulling a little bitJim shark seems tend to be a littletight for me I think the ribbed paneldetailing is really flowering and it'shonestly just like really soft sothere's no booty count or anything onthese leggings so if you like a moresubtle legging that's not like here's mybutt these are cutemedium compression very flatteringdefinitely good for like a training dayin the gym I don't love how the crotchregion is kind of like bubbling up andstretching a lot if these definitely aremy correct size like they fit me reallywell on the waist and everything and ifit musically everywhere but yeah Iactually say these excel you likefriendly because the fabric is prettythick in it and it also has a decentamount of compression so you'd probablybe okay with a little bit of cellulitebut it's not like totally celluliteproof so there's no camel toe on thesebut you can see the little gusset crotchlike pretty distinctly which like Idon't love that for me in terms of thebooty scale they'd probably be about amedium they are compressive but honestlyare not squishing my butt down too muchand the waistband is like pretty highand goes above the butt line actually mybutt's looking pretty good he's notgonna lie so maybe medium high you cansee some of the little like detailinghere they just have like a lot of littlelike small details on the leggings thatare just woven into the fabric which arereally cute something that I think iskind of weird is that you these lineslike they're kind of not smooth theykind of look like pixelated they go likestraight up straight straight butthey're not like completely straight Idon't know doesn't really bother me butjust something to know I'm going to puta little [ __ ] proof rating of all ofthe colors but if you're looking for asquat proof legging these are probablynot your go-to so I thought I wouldsquat test these with some like regularcolored full underwear you cancompletely see themanything up that is so bad oh my god[Music][Music]now for the ultra seamless sports brawow this is neon I did not realize howit liked me on this orange was on cameraso the sports car is $40 and theyadvertise it as a medium support which Ifeel like it will be actually looks likeit has a decent amount of coverage andthis fabric is decently compressive so Ifeel like you could actually get awaywith this with the larger chest I justlike don't love the asymmetric designshonestly it's not for me I would havejust appreciated if it was like ahigh-neck some people like this so it'shonestly just a personal preference butyeah as you can see on one side theyhave kind of this little open detailingin the front and then all of it goesit's like this little crisscross detailon the back they have the little logo inthe front corner they have some littledetails like around the armpit regionit's kind of like a little knitsituation they have another logo in theback of the sports bra and the bra bandthing is like a double thickness ribmaterial okay here's the sports bra sofirst of all this color looks reallycute with a little pan I must say I justreally I really really don't like this Ihate asymmetrical designs and I don'tknow why but I feel like whoever Jimsharks new designer is just lovesasymmetrical designs because they'vecome out with so many recently andthey're just nothing cute obviouslythat's my opinion but like I feel likesome of you guys have agreed with meI don't know and first of all I wouldjust like to say since this fabric iskind of sheer you've been like okay youcan like really see the paths and likethat's a pet peeve of mine I could takeout the pads but I just feel like ifyou're gonna put the pads in theyshouldn't be visible it's like a lot ofcompanies do this so it's not just Jimshark I really hate it I am going toadmit when I put this on at first thisside was over here it was definitelydifficult for me to get on I was nothaving a good time just because of thiswhole asymmetrical deal I woulddefinitely agree with the medium supportI thought it would be like a little bitmore compressive it definitely hascompression and it has this high neck soit's definitely not light support but Iwould not say high support I would haveliked like a little more of a plane thesports grass since I do have the croptop I don't really love like whatthey're doing with this but the littlestraps in the back are cute I like thatthey're like spaghetti straps and thisneon is just like it's really fun thelittle under armpit detailing is cute aswelloverall theworked where I think it's okay if youlike asymmetry a little difficult to geton and then you can like definitely seethe path I also had like quite an issuegetting these pads on because the top ishonestly this kind of hard to get onitself so yeah that's the situation witha sports bra[Music]now the ultra seamless crop top this wasalso $40 and it's like a cap sleeve kindof compression crop top situation it hassome similar detailing to the sports braand the leggings all around and then ithas these two little holes in the back Iguess this would kind of show off likethe little sports bra strap eNOS if youlike thatI think the crop top is great if youwant a little more coverage and supportthan just the sports bra loan becausehaving this double layer of compressivefabric is definitely like hold you downI do think this is a great option if youwant like a little more coverage andeverythingI personally don't love short sleeves onme but if you don't like showing offlike too much skin and too much likeshoulder and everything this would belike you okay here's the crop top soit's definitely super cropped as you cansee the sports bra is like rightunderneath there but it's really notmoving around when I lift my arms it'ssuper compressive and tight and itdefinitely adds like an extra elementwith like support to the bra so I feellike with the bra and this crop top it'sdefinitely a high support I got this inmy normal size small sometimes I wearmedium and tops but I kind of wanted alittle more compression for this I don'tknow what it is about short sleeves Idon't don't think they're personallylike my favorite thing in the world butmy mom just walked by and she said itwas cute so I don't know you candefinitely see the sports bra underneaththis which like I don't love I don'tknow why Jim shark doesn't design theirstuff so you can wear it togetherbecause like I don't know I don't likethat you can see that there's somecontour detailing up here some contourdetailing on the shoulders so maybeyou're supposed to like to fine theshoulders a little bit I don't know thelittle cutouts in the back you can seesome of the bra straps overall I dothink that Jim shark does a great job ontheir seamless tops I think it's reallycompressive it's really soft and ifyou're looking to add like a little moresupport and coverage to like a sportsbra I think this is really cute[Music]and now the elusive ultra seamlessshortsI didn't realize these would sell out sofast luckily I got on the gym trackwebsite like right away when it launchedgeez look like I saw a four inch inseamshort the seamless shorts are kind ofhard to come by I feel like I mostly seelike Lululemon dupe style shorts sothese look pretty similar to theleggings I'm already noticing someslight differences it looks like they'llhave somewhat of a little bootie contourdetailing it's not like exactly a bootiecontour but they do have this kind ofshaded region like under the butt whichmaybe will like lift it a little bit ohyeah these feel a little superlightweight these are definitely perfectfor summer so yeah I'm interested to seehow these will be so here are the shortshonestly they feel exactly the same asthe leggings in terms of the waistbandvery compressive as you can see goesright above the belly button this isvery flattering height also just verytight on my waist and I do not see thiswaistband stretching out at all I thinkit has a lot of elasticity and I thinkit'll hold its shape as you can see someof these little details are a littledifferent it has the sole contourdetailing that kind of curves the frontso I think they did a great job was likethe design of the shorts I think theylook really cuteso the shorts are like impressive whilebeing stretchy at the same time my onlycomplaint is that I could probably notgo for a medium in these shorts I feellike I would have too much extra roomand stuff but like the little band atthe bottom of the shorts is really tightand it's like cutting into my thighs andthis is honestly why I don't wear shortsso many shirts do this and like theyjust needed to make this little band atthe bottom less tight it's just kind ofsquishing my little like upper thigh fatit's just that cute it's squishing alittle bit there too it doesn't feellike it's constricting a lot and theydefinitely feel like they're gonna stayon and they're not gonna like roll upfor sure but I think they are definitelyreally cute and summery very bright andif you don't want the legging optionthese are a lot more lightweight I justwant to quickly make a note that theinside of this fabric is literally sosoft it feels like the inside of areally fluffy sweatshirt and honestly itmakes these so comfortable I'm likepretty impresseddid you see how soft this is[Music]okay so that is the Jim shark ultraseamless collection I hope you guysenjoyed this videooverall I feel like I love the fabricand its really really soft has a goodamount of compression and I think thatthey didn't excellent job with thecolors and overall like pieces of thedesign I really loved but like theorange leggings are just like a way toosheer for me and basically everything isreally sheer none of the pieces I waslike totally in love with the last timeI really was in love with the Jim truckcollection was the high-waisted flex andI'm just not feeling the same about thisto be honest alright I hope you guysenjoyed this brutally honest review makesure to give this video a thumbs up ifyou enjoyed it and if you've beenwatching

exercise here I didsome dumbbell squats I did three sets of12 on this one and for all of myexercise really it was three sets soeventually i'll be heading into forabout four sets of things depending onthe exercise if it's more of a compoundmovement then i like to do more sets ifit's more of an isolation type exercisethen about three just just for thisthough it depends on what body part i'mactually working the bigger stuff i liketo do more sets rather than the smallerstuff like the calves and the arms ilike to keep it at at three sets or sojust because they get worked a lotthroughout the week whereas the biggerstuff like the chest and back not somuch but yeah so eventually i'll creesmight increase my volume but that'llhappen in about another week or so butwe'll see but yeah so I did I made surethat on this leg day now I did a lot ofquad work but I also focused a lot onthe back of my legs my hamstrings and myglutes especially just because they tendto get neglected quite a bit just inyour everyday life i'm not talking aboutexercise but when you're walking bendingover things like that yeah it's a lot ofquad stuff and so the the glutes and thehamstrings tend to be a little neglectedand from what I've noticed a lot from alot of my clients is yeah the theirquads are a little too strong inrelation to the back of their legs andso I like toemphasize a little more on the back ofmy legs when I do my leg workouts ohyeah so as you can see i did one stuffhere ended up with doing some calves acouple calf exercises straight leg thenbent knee exercises and hit that entirecalf

chief brandofficer and he's joining me todayno before we begin um give me the shortback storyon how you became jim shark's chiefbrand officerand and how that all happened so i stoleben's job not many people know this butben used to be my boss and was the chiefbrand officer and i sat down with himone day and saidlisten man i think if both of us went tothe interview for chief brand officeri think i know who would get it and helooked back at me and went yeah i thinki do tooand then he gave me the job so i tookthat off him um but he went it went likethis i i had a creative agency beforethis doing all the stuff ido here now at gymshark pretty much anduh ben and his old business partner camealong there's two young kidswith no budget no idea what they wantedto do they just knew they wanted to makesome content and it was really creepybecausei was used to telling people why theyshould invest in content these kidsalready got it and i just like them sothe first ever pieces of content thatjim sharp produced were made by me andmy guysand then you know we did more and moreand more and it got to a point where bensaid why don't we create thissort of content machine and influenceand marketing all this kind of stuff inhouse at gymshark and we dowhat you guys do in-house i came in asthe creative director then branddirector and then like i saidben was chief brand officer and ithought man i need that job so i took itoff himwe've all heard the the famous sort ofhenry ford quotewhich is if i asked people what theywanted they would have said a fastercourse how does that statement resonatefor you right nowa lot there's there's a there's athere's a shopify interview where i'mquoted as sayingthat one of your guys jason wasinterviewing us and he kept sort ofhe kept really bigging me and ben up andsaying god you guys are so good at thisand that and really giving us showing usin compliments right and i said man isaid listenwe're not great marketeers we're goodlisteners there's a differencewe listen to what the audience say andand you know we act on that andand in that way you never really feellike you're going out on a limb with thegymshark community because by and largethey've probably informed you know thedecisions that you're makinghowever the henry ford statementand another person i massively respectis ricky gervais and i don't knowhe always says i don't know where we gotit from but i think the guy's a geniusand he saidto conduct the orchestra sometimes youhave to turn your back on the audienceand i think that's also very true aswell so yes we're very very aware ofwhat the community want we listen tothemi always say i said to um the thevaynermedia guys recently on aninterviewthat there's gold in instagram commentslike brands should spend less timetalking to their audience some more timelistening to their audience there's goldin those comments if they just readthroughin their comments and in theircompetitors but there are those momentswhere you have to gopeople don't always know what they wantsometimes you have to show them whatthey want so yeah i think i think ifi think if you're an overbearingdictator and you're constantly trying toserve them the new the new big ideait's it i don't think don't think that'sgoing to go well either you have tostrike that balance nicely understandwhat they're saying to you but then alsounderstand that sometimes you're goingto have toshow them what they want next i thinkone of the things thati'm always most impressed with is thatyou have very muchblended the definition of who is acustomerwho is a fan of yours who is aninfluencer of yourswho is part of your marketing team umand who's just someone who likes to wearyour clothingum how do you think about that i meanobviously we can get into influenceruh strategy later on but but that almostis not as important to me asis how do you consider someone um a fanversus a consumer versussomeone who is an extended part of themarketing teamwell i could i could i could draw out avery marketing cmostyle diagram of the the ambassadorshiptriangle which is the athletes at thetop and then our customers the nextthe next lower tier after that but to behonest that's me sort of backwardstranslating into sort ofmarketing talk we use the word family alot andwe just we just act as such like wealways say like if we hadn't beencreating gymshark when we did we wouldhave been wearing it we would have beenone of the you know the fans the peopleinvolved in the communityso we've never really consideredourselves above them for any reasonright there's a famousi know you guys love the story aboutwhen we moved to magento and it all wentsouthand the whole thing nearly one of myfavorite storiesthough when the whole thing nearly diedben sat and wrote likethousands of thousands of apology cardsand white happenedand here you know what i'm saying therewas never any there was nowell i'm the founder or the ceo themajority shareholder and that just iswhat it is andlike hiding behind you know pressstatements or anything like that it wasdear tom i'm so sorry about whathappenedas though you would to another member ofyour family i'm saying like a trueconversation fierce appearwhen we did the world tour we called ita world tour it wasn't a world tour butit was basically myselfben three athletes we we jumped on aplane flew in economy rented the carfrom hertzand said we will be in times square at12 o'clock let's hang outand just just thousands of peopledescended that's where the big pop-upstores that you see now all came fromand it was just the most it was just themost sort of ghetto throw it together it let's just do it and see whathappens kind of uhyou know experiential marketing we coulddo but all that time we were we wereconstantly on the receiving end of allthis qual feedback you know what i'msaying and understanding and data eventhough you don't realize that's what itis at the timeit sharpens your idea of what jim sharpneeds to be we sharpen thisunderstanding constantly throughuh social media through hanging out withthe audience through asking questions toanswering questionsof what they want from us and equally wehave a vision what we want to be to themand somewhere in the middle of thatthere's there's an amazing hundred yearbrand being builti think because you've been limited byresources for so long and certainlyin the shopify story the same thing wehad to get really creative because wedidn't necessarilyhave a lot of resources so we had tobecome very resourcefuland this idea that creativity startswhen the constraints get appliedis so important in the early days of anybusiness because there are so manyconstraintsand i think if you had adopted thiscompany withyou know a billion dollars in cash inthe balance sheet and a massiveyou know sales machine as opposed tohaving to build it from scratchyou probably would have had a biggerevent in times square it probablywouldn't have felt nearly as authentic ahundred percent yeah i would sayit's no secret right everybody's seeingthe news that we just achieved theunicorn statuswhen we were going through that wholeinvestment process and and the uh thepotential investors are speaking to meand sayingum how is it you've how is it you've youknow happened across thesethese innovative marketing strategiesand this new way of building brands andit was like because we didn't have wewe couldn't do it the way everybody elsedid well i couldn't i can't go pound forpound against nike i will lose thatbattle you know what i'm saying i keptsaying to those guysif i had to fight floyd mayweather i'mnot gonna box with him you know what i'msayingi'm gonna kick him in the balls and i'mgonna try and get my friend to hit himwith the car i'm gonna figure somethingelse out you know what i'm sayingand that's what we're doing withgymshark we're constantly like hackingand trying other things to get aroundbecause we can't play that same gamelet's let's talk quickly about thatbecause a lot of folks that are watchingthis right noware trying to build their own brandthey're trying to build their ownbusinessand i'd love to ask you you know youtalk a lot about listening to youraudience and helpingand and having them help guide yourstrategy your brand your companybut what advice would you give tosomeone who doesn't yet have an audienceuh who's just starting a store you knowon day onethere will be other brands out theredoing what you're doing already like youknowpotential rivals in the future slash uhvery similar thingsthat you're doing hang out in theircomments right find out where theircommunity their customers are gettingannoyed at themand there's there's opportunity therefor sure i'm not saying you reply rightaway like hey hey come over to my brandbecause that's kind of uncool right butjustthat should that should start tofine-tune your understanding of what'swhat's where the gap is in that marketyou know what i'm saying so if you canfindlittle nuggets of information amongstthere fulfill that need it won't be verylong until people are saying hey i knowyou you knowyou're having a bad experience overthere have you seen these guys um so ithink there'syeah i think people start startbusinesses too early they start worryingabout what their ads say their copythey're creativeand they just basically they're goingout there with a megaphone shoutingabout what their brand israther than going out with the megaphonego out and listen and then try and youknowslowly address those pain points sowe're going to watch a couple of videosuh right now videos that you have allproduced inside of jim shark and i wantto get your reaction to it i want tounderstand it a little bit better solet's play themso yeah this was um that's definitelyone of my favoriteblack friday uh campaigns to date sosome likewe've been trying to build up this thingwith black friday right i know in thee-commerce world in fact when i spoke atcommerce plus in new yorkuh hannah abbas was interviewing me andthere was the screen in front with allthe questionsevery single question was about blackfriday is it true you guys hadx hundred thousand people on yourwebsite at once all this stuff so everyyearwe know we have to raise the bar when itcomes to black friday and with this oneand one black friday you actually turnthe site off yeah we did yeahdisruption disruption i love no i i loveit but tell me about this video herelike this is shot in slow-molike how did it all work yeah yeah so umso well the whole the whole thinking washow are we gonna stand out this yearright and we thought the idea of seeingyour favorite influencersfighting over jim sharp products youknow tackling each other through theboxes you'rewrestling each other exactly you hadryan garcia uhone of the most influential names inboxing right now standing head-to-headwith tatiana suarez one of the hottestfemale ufc fighters like arguing over agymshark hoodie or whatever it was um sofirst of all we knew the concept wouldmake people laughsecond of all we knew we were buildingup this reputation in the industry andwith the consumers that the gym sharksite ischaos on black friday right and wethought how better to actually bringthatthan to bring that to life in real timeand we've all seen those videosthe sort of the data behind it was we'veall seen those videos whereuh the doors open at walmart or asthey're in the ukpeople are saying yeah exactly peopleare punching each other in the face for20off a tv set right and we thought we'veall seen those clips go viral so itstands to reason if we do that with thegymshark athletes we'll get a lot ofshares and we can go viral online soyeah that's where it came fromi love that all right let's show anotherclip here let's roll something elsethis is this is fun man i like this[Applause]so yeah what this is about um there's alot of sort of gym shark imposters onsocial mediauh pretending to be us for for aplethora of reasons to be honest they'reeither trying to sellknock off gymshark products which we weconstantly deal with but you knowlike like you said earlier harleythere's a lot of big brands with a lotof money in the war chest and can't stopthat from happening so we can't eitherum so there's that but the bigger thingand this thisalmost talks to us of protecting ourcommunity is there are there arevery strange people out there who willpretend to be jim shark on social mediaand say we're interested in making you agymshark athleteand asked to send in like photographs ofthem and measurements and can you sendone in your bra and weird things likethatso although it's not us and it hasnothing to do with uswe feel we owe our community somethingright yeah we feel responsible to sayyou know make sure you don't fall forthis nobody from gymshark will everreach out to you in this way if itdoesn't have a blue tick it's not comingfrom usum it's it it's alarming social media isa social media is a great place forbrands like us right and for contentlike this and stuffbut there is also some really darkcorners of it and if we can help combatthat then we absolutely shouldi love that all right let's let's rollone moreso here's how it went down onei wanted to use my student discount codewhich was no problemi just got my code ready earlier in theday to save timetwo i acted fast items are not reservedin your carthree so what happens here is we mixedin the actual campaign content the thethe uh the guy giving the uh news flashthethe bde uh sale has gone live and thenit's here's some stories of peoplewho've successfully shot beforeso blaise who's in the campaign videothat explains how she successfullyshopped during the black friday periodlast year so she says things likeyou know i was logged in i had mystudent discount ready i had did iti knew which one i wanted i did it to mycart and the reason we do that isbecauseto put it into sort of bricks and mortarterms like we mentioned earlier runninginto walmart to get a tv setwe just gave blaze them we just we'regiving the customers the map of wherethe thing they wanted you know what i'msayingyou guys know better than anyone rightthat much traffic is in a website at onetimeis not good for the website so what wewant to try and do is equip theconsumers with as much info on how tosuccessfully shop during the blackfridays out as possibleum and it also it leads to a bettercustomerexperience for them and it alsoalleviates pressure on the customerexperience teams here the social guysyou know i'm saying all that kind ofstuffhey guys is is student discount turnedon or do i need to be logged in canwill things get cleared from my car wetry and front load and answer all thosequestionsbefore that 7 pm go live so by the timeyou're thereyou've got that fastest finger firstmentality they're ready to go they knowwhat they want they're logged inand you know their chances of gettingwhat they want during the sale periodyou know tripled we have one more ithink to showso this is a pretty standard video thatwe've seenyou you've seen this a million times forsuretell us what's going on here so this isthe when the pandemic first hit you hadall these people at a loss of you knowhow to train where to train what totrainum so we turn to our athletes and sayright what we need from you guys ishelp the community they can't get intothe gym so you explaining how to benchpressisn't going to work for them anymore weneed you to flood your social media weneed content that we can repostof how people can get a workout in fromhome because we understand just how muchphysical health is intrinsically linkedto mental health as well right and itwas a dark time for a lot of people outthereand we had all these super inspirationalpeople right from the biggest fitnessinfluencers in the worldwith a way to inspire people and helpthem get a bit of a sweat on from homeand we did that in awe did that in a ton of different waysbut going back to what we talked aboutearliersome of that some of that content wassome of the best performing content weever put out rightum so the the thing you mentioned harleyof almost that defeatist attitude of ohit's okay for jim shark they've alreadygot millions of followers so their stuffcan go viralthis shows that you don't need the highproduction value right you don't needtheyou don't need the creative directorsyou don't need the agencies you don'tneed the storyboards you just needthat great understanding of the painpoints of your customer right now and totry and address it and isisn't that the best part ofentrepreneurship or retail or commerceor brand buildingis that again you don't need to have themost amount of capital the most amountof resourcesyou just have to be authentic andresourceful what this video does andwhat the series of videos doesis that it gives value uh the irony ofus talking about how you needhuge creative budget to make it you knowmake content resonateus we we changed that into home shark ontwitter we screenshotted thatwe put it on instagram and we wrotewe've changed our name to home sharkbecause some of you guys needed toremind me to remind you to stay at homebecause not everyone everybody wasabiding by the rules and that is ourmostliked most engaged piece of content jimshark has ever put out as a brand nowlet me go back tolet me go back to what it took to createthat an understanding of the consumersright and the current situation theyfound themselves inso entered some text on twitterscreenshot post not one camera wasinvolved in the making of our mosthighly engaged piece of content everand i said i said and and you know theysaw that it made them laugh it resonatedwith them they reposted it they saw whatwe didwe helped out the nhs here in the uk andi always i said itin again in the in the the shopifyinterview i did with you guys jasoni stole this thing from the irish primeminister that let them say of us whentimes were at their worst we were ourbestand that's what i had in my entirethat's what i had in my head the entiretime during the pandemicwhat can we do to put our values ondisplay to the world and make them saywhen it all went to jim sharp werethere and jim shark gave us what weneededi'm writing that down when times were attheir worst we were at our bestyeah let them say of us when times wereat their worst we were our best that'ssomething he said when he addressed hisfirst address to the nation and iabsolutely loved it you resonated withme i said it on the jim shark internalpodcast i said it on the interview withshopify andit can't have been more true for jimsharp the amount of stuff we did duringthe pandemic during lockdownand i know that we made people you knowcmos will talk about the ltv of acustomerand if you want to put it into thoseterms i know that the ltv of a bunch ofcustomers went through the roof but whati know more than everor so the more the way i would put it iswe strengthen the family ties between usand the communitymore than we could have you know throughany marketing any contentany traditional stuff we could have donethere is nothingthat builds more trust than when thingsare toughyou showing up in the right way notshowing up in the easy wayyou know but in the right way insteadand usually the right way cost you moretakes more time is more challenging thanthe easy way but it almost always paysoff longer term andand the payoff is is you build brandslike like gymsharkcouldn't agree more so before we we weleave it i want to be respectful of yourtime and and let you get back to workone thing that that i think is reallyimportant is right now there'sit feels like the world is in need ofmore inspiration the world is need inneed of moresupport and and and guidance and helpand careand and you know what's one thing thatyou would say to someone whowants to build something special wantsto build the next gym shark or the nextshopifywhat is something you would say to themtoday so a lot of people know the jimshark story they're inspired by it nowright and they they knowthey know of ben francis the wonderboyentrepreneur he's the new richardbranson and all this stuff butthe one thing i'd say is we're a lotmore scaredof the next 19 year old in the garagethan we are ofthe board at nike or adidas or lululemonor any of those guyswe're a lot more scared of that next kidso you might just be that next kidi love that that's so impactful thankyou so much for spending some time uhwith us noeland uh congrats on all your continuedsuccess and and thanks for just thanksfor being my friend thanks for being afriend of shopify'sand uh and and i love that you folksnever make any small plansand you continue to inspire me that'sthe reason why all of us at shuffle iget up every day is to helpmore people build the next gym sharksand uh it's it's amazinglovely it wouldn't be gymshark withoutshopify thanks

well hellowelcome back to my channel welcome ifit's your first timetoday we are going to talk about gymsharkspecifically the gymshark flexcollectionwhich consists of a whole bunch ofdifferent things so we're just going toget right into the video[Music]okay so we're going to start with theflex high-waisted cycling shorts andmatching sports bar in graythey're really lightweight and kind ofthin but not liketoo thin if that makes sense um they'vealso got this littlemesh paneling down the sides ofvisibility they're made fromthat a really kind of soft knit seamlessmaterialthe waistband is double layered comparedto the rest of the leggings so it giveslike good compressionaround the belly area gives you thatnice snatch lookyou know the inseam of the shorts isseven inches and the whole short lengthis 14 inches so they're a little bitlongeven on me i'm only 5'3 also the rest ofmy measurements will be in thedescription box below if that helpsso naturally they fall kind of myth onme but what i do is itend to kind of like pull them up a bitso i scrunch them upbecause i think this is more flatteringon me than like the red long look ithink thatshortens my legs umthese are really lovely they've got thisamazing like little booty corner on theback which really helps shapethe glutesso the thing about this color is ofcourse because it's such a light colorit's not necessarily that good at hidingsweat but it does dry quicklyi think that's because like the sidemesh i think that really helpsso next these sports bar so this is thematching sports bra with the high-risedead flex it's got removable cup pads inso you can take them out if you want ialways like my name because i think thatgives me likea tiny bit more lift umit's not necessarily my favorite shapeto be honest so i don't really get thesesports barsquite often i think this is one of twothat i have they're nice they provide agood medium support for me i meanthere's 2b buti just necessarily am not that much of afan of the look itselfokay so these are the same shorts as thegray onesjust these ones are the marlo pop-upcolor i don't know it comes up a bitpink to me but there's supposed to bemore of that kind of light purpleyeah so these shorts and the extra smalleverything in this video would be extrasmall as my usual gymsharksize but yeah they're they're reallynice i really like them i justwish they took a couple inches off thebottomokay next up are the mid-rise flexshortsnow the body of these shorts are makingthat samesoft knit seamless material as thehigh-waistedcycling shorts biggest differences ofcourse these are smaller these have onlya four inch inseam and of course thewaistbandthis waistband is made of an elasticmaterial and it hits right at thesmallest part of my waist for me so ithink that's why i like them a lotbecause i just findwhere it hits super flatteringum now these are not the first iterationof the flexshorts that kind of look like this umgymshark used to have themdifferently they were more low rise andthe band was a lot shorterand the instagram show as well so i justnever saw that for me likelow rise just does not look good at mebut theseare amazing they're easily one of myfavorites i have them in a whole bunchof different colors[Music]these shorts have that same meshpaneling as wellas the high-waisted cycling shortsand they also have the booty contourwhich helps give you a nice lifti can't get you out of[Music][Music]treat me[Music]i absolutely love because when i sawthem they reminded me so much of thoselike og nike proshorts and i've always loved that neoncolor but they'realways the right they never make themwith a higher waistband so when i sawthese i just had to get themlike it was the first time[Music]like it was the firsttake you time[Music]now these in theory should be the sameas the shorts just longer butthere's just something about them that ijust don't like it's just not myfavoritemaybe it's because the band is just atiny little bit lowerand that throws me off or maybe it'sbecause it's not very good with thecamel toe like and that always annoys meum these come up to a seven eight lengthof me just around the ankleand i'm only five foot three so i don'tknow what that means if you're a bittaller than me they have a 22 inchinseam which isa little short actually when you thinkabout it butyeah i don't know what it is about theleggings butjust not my favorite i kept them becausei really like this color combination buti didn't go back for more because i knewi just want to wear them[Music]so next up the flex tank now this onewas a little bit weird becausearound the time that i noticed it on thewebsite is whenthe athletes were talking about all theother releases with the high-waistedcycling shorts and the mid-rise shortsbut nobody said anything about theseand then i just looked at a website oneday and saw them and i thought oh iwould give that a tryand i actually really quite like themnow they're made froma really soft not very thick polyestermaterialthey've got the mesh vents in the frontright thereand also in the back up thereand they're so comfortable i find themgreat for just a throw on tank if youjust need something to quickly put overyour outfit or your sports barand go they don't have any built-insupport at all they're just aplain tank really so you definitely haveto wear a sports bra under thisif you're gonna go work out and if youjust lounge in it doesn't really matteryou can justchill out on this all day i absolutelylove it i really like this little scoopit has in the frontand in the back as well i think thathelps it really sit nicely on curves andenhance themeven though it's not clingy you canstill see you still see the bodyokay so this is another one of thosethings justrandomly showed up on the website butnobody talked aboutand when i first saw it i laughed somuchi thought i'd buy it anyway and see whatit's likeand then it came in and i put it on andi absolutely loved itit's made from that same smoothness knitmaterial as theother waxit's very much a unitard i absolutelylovehow much it just kind of clings to everycurve it goes and comes outnow the bottom of it is an 8 inch inseamwhich again i justkind of hike it up up the body because ithink that looksso much nicer now let's get to the backso the back has thesereally cute crisscross strap designall the straps are adjustable whichreally helps give you a little bit moresupport and control it's got this littleopening right herewhich adds a little spice to the unitchart makes a little bit morejust sexyso now the unit chart itself doesn'tactually have anybra cups in and i don't think there'sany way to put any innot that you really need them i thinkthis is very much for lounging and justkind of hanging around not reallyworking out andbut i really like them and i really hopethey make more cards10 out of 10 honestly[Music][Music]okay so that's all of it that's all theflex i own if i had to pick onei would have to go with the mid-risesimply because of how much i love thoseshortsit's funny because the high-waistedcycling shorts used to be my likeultimate holy girl from gymshark andthen they came throughand switched up the other flex shortsand i just absolutely feel for themi would also recommend getting the tankit's greathonestly since i've had it i've worn itso many times it's ridiculousand this unitard as well because inlockdown you need something you justthrow on and hang around the houseall day and this is perfect for thatokaylet me know if you try anything out fromthis video leave it down in the commentsany questions you may have as well downin the comments thank you so much forwatchingplease like share subscribe and watch myother videosgo right there and come back for morefun stuff

hey guys just wanted to make a quickvideo for you all for my new gym sharkpants that arrived today I ordered amedium and I haven't tried them on yetso I'm gonna give it a give it a shotright now see how it fits and the reasonwhy I got a medium was because all thesepeople that have bought the gym sharkclothing and are at least around like ata height of 511 510 they said that themedium fit them perfectly and me beinglike a little bit above 6 feet but below6 1 I wanted to give this a shot see howit fit and and just see how it goes andas you can see I do have my SBD kneesleeves next to it because these aregonna be depending on using forsquatting and the reason why I got thiscombo was because I don't want to havethose SBD knee sleeves smelly dirtyevery single week and from what I'veheard is that when you put them over anytype of clothing they tend to last threemaybe even five times as long clean asopposed to having them directly go onyour skin so I'm gonna try this on rightnow and then I'm going to show you guyshow it looks like alright so here it isI have them on and my first initialthought is that they have a great feelto them so as you can see it's rightabout at my waist this is not how Iwould wear I would probably wear alittle bit below my waist because that'show I like to wear most of my gym pantsgym shorts you know whatever they feelreally good on the thighs and on thecalves being that it's a medium Ithought I would have to get a largelater on but I don't think it's going tobe the case because they have a reallygood stretchy feel to them as well so ifI go down for a squat you know I wouldwant it to betight to my when I really tight to myskin but something that won't pull upfrom the bottom so I have to get theside look right nowthe back look I don't know if you guyscan see that now back to the front soagain I am a little bit above six feetand this would be something that I'mgonna have my SBDC sleeves on foranybody out there that is above six feetactually let me put it this wayabove six one I would definitelyrecommend you getting the large justbecause right now it's a perfect fit tome all the way down to my leg actuallymy ankle with a little bit of room tospare if I wanted to pull it up so I'massuming with anybody that's at 6 1 orabove you know that would be a littlebit too short so I would definitelyrecommend getting a large for that butdefinitely great quality you know Jimshark is they don't lack in qualitythat's for sure it is expensive is uhforgot how much I think was about 31euros which is equivalent to about $5050 American dollars so it is prettyexpensive but if this is something thatyou're not going to be using everysingle day and you're it won't be wornout very soon then this is a def this isdefinitely a great investment so in thenext video I'm gonna be showing you guyshow they look like or how they look withthe SBD knee sleeves and I'm going toshow you how to put them on with thisand to add on to what I was talkingabout before these the name of thesepants specifically they are the fittapered bottoms so you know I don't wantanybody to get confused because I knowwhen I was first looking up videos onthis specific type of pant I was tryingto find the name of it because I knowthe gym shirt has quite a few of them sothis is once again the fit taperedbottoms,22,UCW9WpoQwDMHWhSUEefr3TuQ,Miss Lizzie,5,1,0,31,"['fitness', 'myprotein', 'gymshark', 'fitmiss', 'fitnesshaul', 'review', 'gym']","FITNESS HAUL AND REVIEW!

all year round and thenmaybe the next day I'll buy clothesmaybe not not guaranteed but we'll seenow I'm making my own money though Ifeel as long as I have extra money thanI'm not too stingycuz that ain't that's not how you enjoyyour life so anyways alright so here wego let me show you what I got well letme show what I go first up right here wegot the UH the element t-shirt color redsize M look at this pretty cool nextso what else we got in here we got theboom element t-shirt I'm not I don'tthink this tastes about coral but uhthis is the coral colored one check itout I got the white shark instead of theblack shirt a little different alrightlittle we got what is this the seamlesst-shirt aqua and look at that BAM we gotthree Jim shark wristbands I'm actuallygonna give some of these away prettymuch like I'm only got one of these formyself of course the pink one becausethat's my favorite color but these onesI got so I can give away to some peopleso yeah very cheap and I think it lookspretty nice I think looks pretty nice sogot the wristbands in here and moving onwe got boom what is this it's just asmallall right so these are they are like theUH like stretchy track pants that arevery soft and very lights as wellthey're not thick at all it's not fleeceor anything it's just very stretchy softlights material track pants and thething is like I already have a pair oftheseand I have them in medium okay but themedium ones they're actually pretty bigif you want like a better fitted likemore fitted look that on them then youprobably would I don't know like you'veseen my leg I don't have to see my legsbut like my legs are pretty decently biglike see it's like this I don't knowwhatever I mean I start I've shown youbefore anyways but with the medium onesthey're kind of baggy and I prefer thetighter looks so I got a small this timeand I will not be what I will not bedrawing these because I'll just keepthem like thisI think they'll fit pretty well alrightnext we got what is this a charcoalcolored one so here's the gray onehere's a charcoal color one same thingwe got well a black one I actuallyalready own a black one but like I saidthe one that I own of black is it is amedium and and okay right here actuallyso this this is what it looks likeoh wait no it's not it uh oh it's on theground over here oh I'm stupid alrightso this is what it looks like so let meplay thomna so it's just like this someyou know track pants these ones havebeen washed they're kind of not as pureblack as it used to be but still nicenonetheless a very light look at thismaterial they got zippers on the sidedown here and as you can see like verylight see it's very thin it's not thickat all there's no fleece on the insidesee the insides just cloth it's verysoft it feels very good but this is themedium as you can see it's a littlespare pretty baggy even when I wear themthe back is this cool design on the backpocket but another reason why I I thinkwhen I fell actually I'm not sure whenit happened butthis is a hole right on the booty overhere too so yeah I got a new pair ofblack ones so very cool i really likethese pants and i wear these to schoolson you know what I'm teaching so yeahand it's finally I got BAM of gym sharpa bag slash backpack this is actuallyexactly the same as the one that Ialready have right here oh my god comeon come on guys stay in there man butyeah this is very handy because it's agym bag you know normal gym bag but itopens like this but they have thebackpack attachable straps look righthere you can pull these straps out ofthe little ziplock and then hook themonto the bottom right here so it canbecome a backpack and it's very usefulas a backpack because normally backpackshave many different compartments rightso you can't just shove everything inthere but since it's a gym bagcompartment inside you can put a lot ofthings in there even though it's abackpack so I bought another one becausethis one's kind of worn down actually uphere or if you can see this yeah thereyou go you can see you know look at thisit's getting a little ripped becauseI've used it for a little under a yearand I've put a lot of heavy things inhere sometimes sometimes they over stuffit to be honest so got another one it'snot very it's not too expensive so veryhigh quality I like it I like it so thatis the unboxing from that is theunboxing from jib Sharks so I will tryon these shirts and let you know whatthey look like on the sizing andeverything so just hang on a sec alrightguys so it is actually 347 now and I'mhere at the gym this one where right nowthis is the aesthetic revolution miniwings stringer look at that much of mucha better fit now anywaysI decided that like I said I was gonnashow you guys earlier what the clotheslooks like but then I just then Irealized you know it'd be much Iactually did it one time I was wearingone of the shirts and I tried to showlike I just recorded myself showing theshirt and the kit and then my whoa can'ttalk I tried to record myself showingthe shirt in my bathroom mirror but it'snot very cool like the lighting is notvery good there it's kind of like yellowlight so it doesn't move exactly lookreal and the mirror is so small youcouldn't really see anything so Ithought it'd be a good idea if I justcame in here to the gym and shows youguys all the clothes over here so Iactually brought everything that I gottacheck it out got the three shirts andthe three pants and i'ma try my here andI'll show you what they look like sohere we go and then I'm gonna work outright after but yeah so but drink thisup and while it's you know taking effectthis is just the amino energy while it'staking effect let me show you guys whatthe clothes looks like alright guys soalright guys so I'm not going to a youknow a really color coordinate too muchI'm just gonna try one one pair of pantson one shirt at the time so I can justdo it in three changes so first offwe're gonna start with the coral Coralcoral element t-shirt medium and whichone of these sucks the least with thisone probably all right we're in thecoral medium element t-shirt and thesmall I don't know what this is calledyeah check later but stretch fit trackgray track pants so this is gonna befirst up right here these two alrightguys so here it is check it out let mezoom out yeah so this is it so these arethe small grey track pants as you cansee like they fit very well I like thisfit much better with the medium size itwas very loose like it was like superbaggy like there's no fit whatsoever onthe medium so small looks much betteryou can see in the quads through hereand then here's the medium shirts and Iwant to tell you guys everything likeexactly what I'm thinking about this soreal quick like so this shirt feelsreally good it's very effective I'm notsure exactly how they made it but it'slike stretchy it's it's stretchy it'snot just like a normal cotton it's verystretchy so that feels very good andsame with the past pants are stretchylook at this and these pants are verylight there's no fleece inside it's justcloth so it's very light very stretchyand it feels really here like theseclothes feel very light and feels likeyou have a lot of mobility even thoughthey're like tight on you or they'refitted well that you know feels like youhave a lot of mobility just becausethey're stretchy but one thing that'sstrange about the element shirt becauseI already have the gray one and Inoticed it as well is to be completelyhonest with you like this is this ispretty fitted right and I'm not like I'mnot super thick or anything especiallysince this is like I've been going like11 or 12 weeks on this cut so I've losta lot of weight and it's still prettytight on me which is not a problem Ilike the way it fits it feels great andI think it looks good on me but ifyou're a little bit like you theory ifyou're just bigger than me cuz I'm gonnafeel like a lot of people are then youprobably need to get the large size andanother thing is if you notice these thetop right here near the trap area andthrough the mech if it's easier for meto look in the mirror so in the traparea right here and the neck it has thislike extra it's kind of a little extra Idon't know what that is like I'm notsure if maybe I'm supposed to get alarge or something but yeah it has alittle extra trap area and let's justexpect everybody to have like monstertraps or something but I don't have Idon't have a monsterso there's a little like extra a littlepuff up here but it's not too bad likeas you can see it looks pretty good itlooks pretty yeah so this is it so itlooks pretty good it's not too not toocrazy up here I don't want to settledown a little bit more so this is thefirst of the three so just this is themedium element shirt and the small graypants alright so that was number onenumber two we're gonna do the redelement feature just to show you guyswhat it looks likeI know I know for me personally even ifit's the same shirt I still want to seewhat it looks like on somebody so nowwe're gonna do the charcoal small trackpants so here we go next one real quickjust a little attention to detail thegym shirt could they have these tagsthat come with their shirts and then isthat these are very nice tags I mean Idon't know if anybody cares but it'sjust kind of cool you know that theymake these really nice tags check it outsharp fit this is the element t-shirtssculpted fit a tapered tail with arounded lower hug to essentially yourphysique enhanced itching uniquestitching lines for maximum comfortflexibility yes that is true next-levelcomfort it does feel great and you canuse it for everyday wear which is what Iplan to do so right here every gym shirtproduct is designed to complement yourphysique so yeah it's just kind of somelittle nice attention to detail thatthey do for you all right so now backback to what we were doing herealright guys here is the red red elementt-shirt and the charcoal this kind ofblack but yeah the charcoal C redelements in charcoal pants and say yeahthis outfit fits pretty well it's gotthe same weird little chap puffs goingon here but feels very goodthis one's got the black logos one thingone thing about the pants is that checkthis out is really nice because they'vegot the zippers on the pocket so you canyou know it's very safe you're not gonnadrop stuff and you zip it up so you canlike put your phone in here if you ifyou use your phone to listen to musicand zip it up so just the wires comingout so the phone will not fall out andthen down here they also have zippers soyou canyou know pull it up and put it down orwhatever you want to do so that's justanother thing and there's a back pocketback pocket right here but there's nozipper so all right that's number twothe red elements t-shirt medium andsmall charcoal pants and now on to thelast one all right so this last one isthere what is it coldthey're seamless t-shirt aqua coloredand this is more of a this is more of aperformance that workout shirt I'm notsure how to wear this so much for casualbecause it looks pretty very workout IIbut anyways that's that and we're gonnado a small othe small black track same same trackpants just in blacks right guys sohere's the finale so this is the blueeye with the Aqua seamless tee and thesmall black track pants look at this youcan see like the contour like I thinksmall is definitely the right size forme and here's the shirt but seamless Ton the side right away it fits muchbetter I mean that much better but itfeels much better because there's noweird extra space up here so yeah itfits very well and I don't know if youcan see but there's like you see theselittle dots all over the place there's alittle dots all across the front andthere's dust oh and this dots going allthe way down the back as well you seethat so good news so this dots on thefront and the back and along this alongyour shoulders as well and so it's a bitthis is a very breathable super lightalso stretchy hey what's going on sothis one fits much better and yeah so itlooks like so there it is that's thefinale some students just came in sowe're gonna end this video now so I justwanted to show

hey guys and welcome back to my channelif you're new here my name is Catherineand today we are doing a littleaffordable activewear review we arereviewing the Geo seamless dupes as wellas one of my new favorite items from thepoem which are these speed up shortswe'll get into these in a minute butfirst I wanted to go over some of likethe frequently asked questions I getabout ordering from the podium so alsoif you're new here you've probably seenme wearing a lot of items from a brandcalled the poet Jam basically in a poemwas an Aliexpress seller there are a lotof great I'll Express sellers a lot ofthem have the same stuff I chose to workwith the poachin because I always had agood experience there shipping in theirquality and I just trusted them and theyhave sons kind of expanded and started awebsite so you can either order theiritems from Aliexpress directly or fromtheir website for the same items itdoesn't really matter but they're reallygood quality stuff and it's all around$20 and I just love itso now on to the FAQ so yes it doesn'tmatter whether you order from theirwebsite or from Aliexpress if it were meI would just order wherever is cheaperbecause it's the same stuff shippingfrom the same place if you are making abigger order I would probably order fromtheir website because I do have discountcodes and if you order more you get morepercent off I think if you order 10items you get 10% off so that kind ofthing I won't put all my codes here andthey're always in the description belowand you'll see an option on theirwebsite and Alan Alan Express it'll saydo you want to order from the US orChinausually the u.s. is sold out but it'sall the same stuff like it's notdifferent products that they just shipstuff from their Factory in China totheir warehouse in the United Stateswhen they get a chance I don't thinkthey've been doing this very recentlybecause of the whole pandemic situationbut I have never ordered from the USI've always ordered from China I'veheard it's around the same shipping timehonestly so I don't think it reallymatters but yes it's the same stuff nomatter if it's the u.s. or China it allcomes from China they are also workingon making returns free for a long timeI've gotten a ton of questions can youreturn to Aliexpress can you return tothe podium and for a while they were notcovering return shipping which kind ofmade it not worth it to return becausethe shipping back to China would bepretty expensiveI've never returned any stuff I'vealways just sold it on things likePoshmarkMerck re bended now we have a Facebookgroup where you can buy and sell thisstuff to make it a little easier maybeif you're looking for an item thatsomeone bought from Aliexpress theydon't want you'll get it a little bitfaster them from China so feel free tojoin that group but they are working onmaking returns free so I do thinkthey're really trying to improve theircustomer service so I love to see thatbut just a note on customer servicethey're not gonna have the same qualityof customer service as something likeLululemon or Jim shark you're buyingitems for twenty dollars so like you'renot gonna get that kind of qualityguarantee that like Lululemon givestheir product most brands honestly don'tgive the same service as Lululemon but Ijust feel like sometimes people forgetthat you're buying leggings probablyfifteen to twenty dollars yeah you mightnot get the same shipping times the freereturns things like that but they areworking on the free returns you knowterms of shipping times it really rangesa lot of you guys messaged me when youget your in a POJO packages and usuallyI'll ask you how long the shipping tookor you'll just tell me how long it tookI've seen people get their packages inliterally less than two weeks evenduring this pandemic and people who arestill waiting on it in it's been a monthso it's really kind of like luck of thedraw honestly in that case I wouldn'tworry about your package arriving butshipping no matter what is taking alittle longer right now I mean my Amazonpackages used to come to me next daywhere I live they have next day shippingand now they take an entire week soshipping all around is kind of slow sojust be mindful that when this is allover it should be about two to threeweeks yet again I do want to make avideo about ordering from Aliexpress ingeneral because there are a lot of greatsellers out there as wellso make sure you leave a comment downbelow if you have any questions and I amworking on putting a video togetherabout that before we go any furtherplease make sure to give this video athumbs up and subscribe if you're new itreally helps me out lets me know thatyou are liking my videos and withoutfurther ado let's get in to the geoseamless dupes so for the GSC must theydo have the leggings and the crop topthese are a dupe of the gym shark geoseamless that launched last fall andthey have this red color they have tealand black I do have all three colors soI will be squad testing all of them andletting you know if any of them feel anydifferent and I will be going oversizing as well starting off with theleggings these are $20 and it's been awhile since I've tried the actual gymshark one so these feel pretty similarthey're pretty thick knit legging theykind of resemble the camo and feel maybea bit of the vital seamless but they arepretty thick and they definitely arethat knit texture they're not shinythey're not like brushed buttery softbut kind of like the classic Jem darkseamless fabric I forget if I like theseor not I feelit's not my favorite design just cuzlike it's a little busy I feel like myfavorite color is the black because it'sa little more subtle it's definitely oneof those kind of like out there supergeometric designs better than the turboseamless but definitely still was notalways my cup of tea the waistband isdouble thickness and ribbed and has someof the little geometric details the backof the waistband kind of has this littlelike widow's peak detailing to definethe booty a little bit doesn't look likea super crazy like monkey but at leastbut it definitely is kind of surroundingthe booty it's a sort of gradient effectit's definitely very dark up here andthen with the geometric patterns thatkind of like color blocks down to alighter color and in the back they havea little under booty contour it's apretty stark contrast it's definitelylike a light color right next to thedark and then you have some details donelike I have these in both sizes smalland extra small which is usually myrange for an opossum so I will let youknow how they fit alright so here arethe geo seamless these are the sidessmall and I definitely would recommendtrue to size I do have a pair of extrasmalls but I'm honestly not sure I'meven gonna be able to get them onbecause these do feel pretty tight inthe legs already yeah they definitelyfit me everywhere else so I woulddefinitely just go with your normal gymshark size I'm almost always a sizesmall in gym shark actually I think I amalways a size small the waistband onthese is pretty high it goes actuallyway above my belly button so if you areon the shorter side just be mindful thisis gonna come up pretty high on you I dolike the nice high waist but this mighteven be a tiny bit high but thewaistband is giving me a good amount ofcompression I'd say a solid mediumcompression on the waist and medium tohigh compression all around getting alittle bit of gathering here but nothingcrazy nothing more than a regularseamless leggingthey're definitely super thick and verywarm so definitely more of a winterstyle legging for me this kind of fabricdoesn't really kill or collect to be litso you'd be good using resistance bandsfor these I definitely think that thesewould be a nice high performance leggingfor a next leg day I do like the littleombre situations they have going on Ijust don't love all of the geometricpatterns the other booty contour is niceII think they're like super high on thebooty scale though I do feel like I amgetting some universe so I probablysaved some medium on the booty scale I'dsay definitely high compression in thelegsI do feel myself somewhat restricted inthe seam area and in the knee area so tokeep that in mind although I wouldn'tsize up because I do think they fitpretty well otherwise I would say thesewould definitely be cellulite friendlythough you have a little detail going onin the legs to kind of distract fromanything and they are super thick andcompressive yeah but rips of sweatproofing is probably a little bit sweatproof I have a hard time reading thisbecause filk every legging shows sweatso these are also just shy of a fulllength on me they're kind of in betweena 7/8 and full length but I am very tallso for shorter people probablydefinitely be full length if you're alittle bit taller maybe more of a 7/8 sohere's the blue and the size small aswell if it's just the same as the Rose Iwould also say this is true to size so Ineed all the colors basically arefitting exactly the same I would say Ithink I do prefer the blue to the rosecolor because the detailing is just alot more subtle like the booty contouris honestly like barely noticeable ohyou know what these go from a lightercolor to a darker color instead of theother way around like the Reds I'mprobably like the last person to evernotice this but you can heavily tell thebottom of the Blues is a darker colorand the bottom of the Reds is thelighter colors so I don't know I justthe Blues are one more subtle than theReds so I actually think I could seemyself wearing this blue color becauseit just kind of looks like a normallegging with a slight ombre maybe a tinybit of booty contour but yeah and beblack extra smalls I cannot get them onso they are too small go to normal size[Music]next we have the Geo seamless crop topsI always love the new poem version ofthe Jim shark dupe crop tops because Iusually make them a little bit longer sothey don't just go like right under yoursports bra they extend a little bitbelow also now I'm gonna get questionsand wearing view great sports bra one ofmy current favorite podium this is madeof the same fabric as the leggings superstretchy kind of thick knit material Idon't see myself wearing this in thesummer but think ahead to the winter Iguess they do have little thumb holeshere yeah they also have one of thoselittle keyhole backs as well as a bunchof little details whole geometric stylethingies okay so here's the crop toplike I said it does go a couple inchesbelow the bra band which I like becauseit just gives some coverage it's alsopretty compressive down here in the bandso it doesn't not move up when I raisemy arms it stays putit's definitely a compressive style topI definitely feel very held in it isvery warm so campaigns Mia wear thisright now because it's like 90 degreesoutsideI love the thumb holes they always havesome holes and I feel like it fitsreally well throughout the arm sometimesthere's this like awkward bagginessaround the wrist there's a little bit ofroom around the wrist here but it'snothing crazy wouldn't recommend wearinglike a high neck sports bra with thisyou can see it but but the podium canactually make a sports bra they're justmade the top in the leggings which I'mnot a huge fan of long sleeve crop topsbut they're here it does have a cutelittle keyhole back so you can show offa little sports bra detail because theleggings are pretty high waisted and thecrop top is a little long for shorterpeople I have a long torso and I onlyhave like two inches of skin showing ifyou're shorter it'll probably go foldingdown and you won't show anything butyeah the top is nice and stretchy it'sstaying in place I do like the sizesmall I feel like it's snug and a littlebit compressive but not in a way that'suncomfortable so I would go true to size[Music]next we have my favorite thing that justwant from the podium the speedup shortsthere are tons of affordable shorts outthere that are kind of those leggingsale shorts that are like super tightand everything but you don't see a lotof these like looser like running sailshorts I won't be using them for runningbut I've gone on two walks in these nowand it didn't work out and I just lovethem these do not feel like they're $20they feel so so nice and they're just somany little details that I just love andI wish I had every color so usually withthese loose style shorts they usuallyhave that super shiny kind of likescratchy material that makes that littlelike noise when you like walk by theseare actually made of like a superstretchy material so when you squat downyou don't have that kind of restrictionthat you deal with those classic Nikeshorts these actually have like a ton ofstretch to them and they're so comfy Ibeen wearing them around my apartmentfor the past two days no I have notchanged that's just how it is when youfind a cute pair of shorts here's an upclose with the fabric it's actuallyslightly brushed but I haven't had anissue with any pilling yet I don't thinkthat will be an issue because it's notlike super fuzzy but it's just a supersuper luxurious material and I love thatthe front doesn't get all bunched upthey actually don't have the elastic inthe front they do have a functionaldrawstring so this is a real drawstringthe strings themselves actually havesome stretch to it as well but yeah itstays really flat on the front which Ilike but then the back does have kind ofa little elastic detail they don'tballoon out like most shorts like thisthey stay pretty like close to you butthey're not skin tight I definitelythink you have some leeway with sizingwith these because you do have thisdrawstring and they're pretty stretchyso if you go with a smaller size they'restill gonna fit because of that stretchbut they might not just be as like loosethey might be a little more fittedand if you go with a size up you canjust tighten the drawstring it justdepends how loose or tight you want themI will try on both the extra small whichis this one in the small which I'mwearing right now if they don't have anyspecial key pockets or anything but I dohave just like two simple pockets in thefront and they have a super cute meshlining at the bottom and the mesh liningactually has a little bit of stretchitself so it doesn't feel tight on thebottom of your legs when you squat and Idid measure the inseam and it was abouttwo and a half inches her pretty shortshorts but usually when I have loosershorts like this they kind of ride up alittle bit no matter what even ifthey're longer they justa bunch of more in my opinion so yougotta try on I'll show you kind of howthey sit on me but I have worn theselike I said for two walks now and aworkout and not once was my butt exposedso I've been very covered these do nothave any of that built-in underwear so Ihonestly never liked the built-inunderwear because it was just like builtin panty lines like I wouldn't want thatso you don't get any panty lines oranything with these they stay verysmooth they're just they're socomfortable I cannot emphasize how muchI love these they come in the two bluecolors that I have this kind of moreteal color the more periwinkle which I'mwearing right now as well as black and akind of grey purple so let's try theseonalright so here are the shorts and asize small one of the questions I gotwas if they like crinkle up or wrinkledat all and I've been wearing thesesitting around in my couch for two daysnow and I don't have any wrinkles I dohave a little bit of cat fur on themwhich is kind of unavoidable in my housenotice this peach here but I wouldn'tsay these are like major lint attractorsthere's not the shiny material that justlike rip hell's all lint these are thesize small which is my normal leggingsize and I do occasionally size up inshorts but I do think that these fit methe best I have tried on the extra smalland while they fit me just fine and theyare a little bit better in the waist forme they are just overall a little bittighter and I prefer a little bit ofspace and the extra smalls I'll try themon in a couple minutes I didn't get asmuch booty coverage so I would go withyour normal legging size while these area little bit bigger in the waist thanthe extra small it's not really aproblem because I just tie thedrawstring and the drawstring does notlook like it's uncomfortably tight oranything I feel like it's perfectthey do have the two little frontpockets and they are on their own so youcan kind of like see them at the bottombut I haven't had an issue with themappearing during my workouts or walks sothey are short and guys aren't magicshorts like they're not gonna not writeup ever like us let's walk around for aminute all right so that's walkingaround and you can see they kind of likegot eaten up on my thighs a little bitbut this is really as far as they go Idon't feel like they're too shortI am very tall and like let's be realthese are pretty short shorts but I'venever felt like I haven't been covered Ihave not adjusted them so it's not alittle walk and you can see it my buttentirely covered something about the waythese shorts are designed I think itmight be a teeny bit smaller or taken inin the little like mesh region but theyjust really hug around your thighs herewithout being tight you can see it's notsquishing my thighs like in any way butit is just keeping my booty contained alittle bit so I just absolutely lovethem I think these look a lot cuter andmore like I don't know sophisticatedthen like the Nike like bubble shortsthat's not that that's not what they'recalled but that's only what I thoughtabout them and I just love these in asyou can see there's no built inunderwear so you don't have anyunderwear lines so I've absolutely lovedthese for walking but I've also beenworking out in them and it really likedthem for that too because sometimes withthe more loose style shorts like thisthe reason why they have that littleunderwear liner is because you can kindof flash people but because these arerelatively like snug around the legs youcan see there's a little bit of spacebut they don't like balloon out soyou're not like exposing anyone so Inever felt like I was like at risk forflashing while I was working out inthese and I got a lot of questions ifthey're comfortable during squats andthey literally feel like nothing becausethey're so stretchy and they're a littlebit loose so I have not felt restrictedby these at all I would consider these amid to high rise they go back to mybelly button and this isn't me likepulling them up or anything like this isjust like where they are so yeah I feellike these are it's like absolutely astaple if you live somewhere hot I amdefinitely going to be wearing these asmy go-to walking shorts I've also had afew questions about the chafing becausethese are only about a 2 and 1/2 inchinseam they're not gonna cover your fullthighs so you can tell when I'm juststanding with my legs together like mythighs are still touching so they mightstill rub together but you just have toknow yourself if you're really lookingfor shorts that prevent all chafingyou'd probably want to go with like abiker or like 6 inch inseam shorts notsomething short like this but I found onmy walk so far I've been totally ok soit hasn't been a problem for me and mythighsdo touch they are friends ok now I'mgonna try on the extra small and I'llshow you how they're a little bittighter so here are the extra smalls andthese are just kind of a little bittighter all around I don't really haveany room in the thighs here it's notsquishing me down at all as you can seelike I don't have any double thigh edgebut these are definitely a moreform-fitting style short which is why Ifor my normal size it is nice and snugin the waist I didn't even I didn't evendo anything with the drawstring and itstill is a high waist but as you can seethere's just not as much booty coveragelike I feel like if he's brought up atall we might show a little bit of thebooty you know so I just prefer thenormal size I think she's good size downif you want a more tight fit like thisbut I would go with the normal size ifyou want it to be slightly relaxed butnot baggy and if you want them baggy Iwould go with a size up so I hope thathelps but I really love these and Iprobably still wear at this size justaround the house but I do think they'regood for lounging walking and workingout so far I haven't had an issue withany of those[Music]'i'm Ashley this is just a new color nota new product but these are my favoriterhythm leggings and this new kind oflike a mustardy green color it's kind ofan ugly color but I kind of like it forclothes for some reason I don't know Iabsolutely love the rythm leggings fromthe podium they're the exact same as theParagon everyday leggings if you're newto my channel haven't seen my Paragonvideo go watch it basically they're kindof a little m in a line style dupenothing is really a dupe for Lululemonalliance but just to give you an idea ofthe shape they do have a seamlesswaistband at the top and they also haveno front seam so you don't get any cameltoe they have a simple gusset crotch andthey have these really nice curved bootyseams and the seams go above your buttso they're very flattering on the glutesand they are a 7/8 length stay tunedbecause they will be coming up with afull length a little bit higher waistversion soon so for my taller girls whowant me whole bike legging you are inluckokay so here's the new rhythm color I'mjust gonna do a quick review because Ihave done a full review of the rhythmsbefore but they're a high rise they goright to my belly button seamlesswaistband no camel because there's nofront seam and I don't feel like itgathers there very much either high onthe booty scale they have curved bootyseams and they go above your butt soit's just a super flattering they'remade of a really buttery soft materialit's not quite brushed so I have not hadan issue with pilling in these they'renot like that fuzzy material but theyjust are super soft and like I saidthese are a 7/8 length so that is whatthey are on me they are very thin andlight weights I would say they're goodfor summer but they're not great forhiding cellulite so I wouldn't expect awhole lot of cellulite coverageI do wear a size down and wear the extrasmall because they are pretty slipperyleggings so they can slide down but Ihave not personally had an issue withthe rhythms in my size down sliding downso if you want to avoid that I'ddefinitely go for a size down they havea light to medium compression a littlebit more than on lines especially ifyou're sizing down they hold you in justa little more I just love these ifyou're new to no podía when wedefinitely recommend these[Music]all right thank you so much for watchingI hope it was helpful if you had to getone thing from this video I woulddefinitely get those shorts I just lovethem so much it's getting hot outside ifyou are buying through to PO Jim if youhave discount codes for their websiteand a support code for Aliexpress so ifyou use any of those things let me knowI do have a monthly giveaway if you useany of my codes or links I enter youjust so I can give back to the peoplewho

jimmy shark bridal zoomless is backbut is it better than everwell hello welcome welcome back if thisisn't your first timei'm damien your friendly neighborhoodfitness friend and todaywe are going to be talking aboutgymshark viral seamlessnow the battle of stimulus is one ofgymshark's most popular collectionsand i personally have had a bit of alove-hate relationship with it over theyearsi love it because the material isfantasticyou can do any kind of work out of itaway from low to high impactand be just fine but i hate it becausethe waistband it kills meevery single time i get in a new supercute color vital stimulus i have myfingers crossedi'm hoping that this time when they sayextra small they meanextra small and it will fit me justright without the gaping butevery single time disappointment but nowthey've brought it back as the vitalseamless 2.0and they claim they fix the problemswith all the waistbands so let'stest it out for ourselves and see so inorder for us to geta good idea of just how much changeshave been made i will be comparing a newpair of vital that i just got into an opera i got i think i got it andnot the last drop of the drop beforethat when they did a vital seamless onenow in that job i was talking about igot the vital signal shorts and leggingsin thisgorgeous cherry mark color because ithought it would look just great on myskin tone but like i said beforewith the variation in sizes you can seefrom looking atthe extra smalling the shorts andleggings that they're not even the samei'll bring it up closer so you can seeokay so here it is clara for you theshorts are at the topthe leggings are at the bottom and youcan see even placed end to endthat the shorts are slightly bigger thanthe leggings now variation of sizing iskind of a little bit of a big gripe ofmineand it's not just gymshark that's goodhere there's a lot of activatorcompanies do this wherethe extra small in one collection isdifferent from anotherand sometimes even within the samecollection they can be completelydifferenthowever with the new vital seamless youcan seethat that problem appears to have beenfixed now these are the shorts on topagain and the leggings at the bottomplaced end to endand you can see that they're pretty muchthe sameall right next i'm going to compare likefor life oldversus new starting off with the shortsnow these are the old vitals seamlessin cherry marble i think and then theseare the new ones in the warm taupeyou can kind of see that the old onesthe waistbandis like straight up and down and the newones the waistband is more tapered itgoes inthe new vital also has a much thickerwaistband than the old one does the oldone is a lot thinnerbut still thicker than the rest of thematerial same with the new onespeaking of the material the material ofthe new vital is a lotmore compressive than the old one for mepersonallyi find the old one had a bit morestretch and give to itall right here we have the new vital ontop of the old one just so you can get abetter idea of the difference in thewaistbandthese are both an extra small by the wayso you can see the new one has a muchsmaller waistband i tried to line themup as much as possible but they didn'treally becauseof the tapered waist on the new one okayi swept them around and put the old oneon top of the new onejust so you can get an idea of thelength you can see the new vital shortsare slightly longer than the older onesare and they also have smaller leg holesthan the old ones did next we're movingon to the leggingsum the old vital still in that samecherry mouth and new one also in warmtaupeboth an extra small again you can seethe changes in the waistband from thatstraight up and downto the more tapered fit same thickerwaistbandthan the shorts have and they're made ofpretty much the samematerial as the shorts wear okay againi've laidone waistband on top of the other andyou can seethe difference in the size betweentwo extra smalls the new one beingslightly smaller than the old one andyou can see apart from the waistbandthey're pretty much the samesize and the same length but again thenew vitalhave smaller bottom holescuffs than the old ones do so in ourside by side try on we're going to startoff with the shorts before we move on tothe leggingsso the shorts we have the old and theleft and the new on the rightyou can kind of see the difference inthe waistband already even just for mestanding therethe old one clearly has way more room infront than the new one doesas i turn to the side the gaping on thewaistband becomes more obvious wherewith the old oneit's basically just coming off my waistand the new one just kind of sitsmuch closer when i would wear the oldshorts to work out i triedfolding it over to kind of minimize thatwaistband gapping butthat didn't help it just looked just asbad so i would just leave itfrom the back again you can see thegapingstill they've kept the contouring prettymuch the same on both pair of leggingsbutit might be more obvious on the oventhan a new one becausethe old one is more of a mild fabricwhere the new one is morecloser to a solid color both colors ihave a squat proofbut again these are more opaque colorsthat i tend to lean to so i don't knowwhat would happen if you got a lightercolor the new shortshit me much lower than the old onesbecause they are much longerso that means when you're working outdoing squats liftingthey might be less likely to ride allthe way up and give you too muchexposureokay moving on to the leggings againvery similar thing regarding thewaistbands that you sawon the shorts it's not as bad on the oldleggings as it is on the old shortsbecause as i showed you earlierthe leggings have a smaller waistbandthan the shorts for some reasonbut you can still see the gaping whenyou turn to the side whereas on the newonethanks to that tapered waist it justkind of sits a lot closeragain gaming gets worse when you squatdown but they are still bothsquat proof and they both hit me aboutthe same lengthas well okay last thing we're gonna goover is the vital seamless sports bar iunfortunately don't have an old onecompared to it because i think imentioned it on here before thatthat style sports bar is really notnecessarily my favoritebut i did get in the new one just to seehow it compared to my memory of previousvital sports bras i've hadand i can tell you that the new onedefinitely provides you with moresupportit's a little bit tighter especiallyabout the waistbandso i would say if you found the old bythe seamless fits you a bit snug withthis one you mightwant to consider sizing up just so thatwaistband is not cutting into you toomuchmore of a medium support than the oldvital wasthe contouring also looks a little bitdifferent to melike this has to be more contouring onthe other book than the older ones hadif i remember correctlybut i don't think even a new one hasnecessarily changed my mindon how i feel with regards to the stylei don't know i just kind of want them toswitch it up a bit and givesomething a little bit different sooverall would i recommend the new vitalseamless 2.0i would say yes they made some greatstrides towards improving the waistbandi still had a little bit of room inthere but that might just be because ihave a smaller waist compared to therest of meand also even compared to the extrasmall size guideso keep that in mind hopefully they comeout with a few new colors because i willbe getting themi'm kind of hoping they relaunch thecherry mall in this new2.0 style and material so i can havethat like nude color for myself thatfitsjust right well that's it for me todaythank you so much for watchingplease like share subscribe and comeback for more fun stuffi got tons more planned okay

and as you can see we have a huge hugehuge Aliexpress Hall coming at you andthese are all a favorite on this channelJim sharp dupes so I'm just gonna putthese down because they're honestlypretty heavy and IR anyone to the gymtoday so don't need to workouts what'sup guys and welcome back to my channelor if you're new my name is Katherine Ido a lot and a lot lot of ligatingvideos on this channel a little bit offitness in there too so we are going toget through a lot of leggings today Ihave reviewed some of these in the pastso this is kind of going to be more oflike a haul mini review style not goingto go quite as in-depth as I do withsome of my other videos because we justdon't need it you already have theinformation it's already there but I amgoing to tell you all the most importantinformation to know if there's squatproof how stretchy they are compressivethey are what size to get if you'reinterested so if that sounds good to youmake sure to keep watching I'm going topost a link in the description for myfacebook group of activewear cuz I do alot of little mini reviews on a lot ofthis stuff before I get a chance toactually film a whole video on itbecause filming a video takes a lot moretime than just doing a little quick typetype type review review so if you'reinterested in that make sure to join theFacebook group down below okay so firstoff we're going to talk about thehigh-waisted flex so this was definitelykind of a controversial launch for Nepalgym one because well we'll get it intothe sizing later but there's a reasonwhy we don't have any tryouts for theseleggings a lot of people weren't reallysure about the whole like Fitness wordon the back so it's definitely accurateto what gym shark does because gym sharkhas their big logo on the back honestlypeople didn't really love that about gymshark either but yeah it just hasFitness which I'm not really sure aboutI think that it could have honestly donewithout this color at all I think thatwould have been really cute they wouldhave just been a nice like high-waistedgray pair of contour leggings which arevery flattering they have the gray colorthe black color which has the greyFitness logo in the back and then thepink color which I think the pink is myfavorite so I had heard from people whothought these leggings before me thatthey ran a little small this is anunderstatement so I got these in a sizesmall which is my normal size they aretiny um I honestly couldn'tget them over my foot so that was reallyquite a challenge for me at the othertuna size medium and I couldn't getthese on either so I have one video clipof me wearing these in the crotch isprobably like 5 inches below my actualcrotch because I really just couldn'tget them on at all and like I'm so sorryabout this because I actually can'treally review the leggings because Iactually can't give you a lot of likereal details on these leggings becausethey are just run they just run so smalllike so we don't really know if theysquat proof they honestly feel like theywould be scrap proof they feel prettythick the actual details are verysimilar to Jim shark I'll just go oversome of the details right now they havea thick ribbed waistband they have thesame contour detailing it's Jim sharkand then they have the same under bootycontouring as well and the seams lookvery similar to Tim shark as well as youcan tell these really do look like exactdupes for me I think the fabric might beslightly thinner than Jim sharks cuz Idid have Jim sharks high-waisted flexbut yeah honestly if I can't tell youtoo much about these because they wereso small I couldn't get them on so Iprobably could have had it size large inthese leggings and I have literallynever worn size large in leggings evereven when I slice up in leggings usuallyin the size mediumso these run super super small so gethonestly 2 full sizes up from a normalsize if you're interested in these but Ihave a feeling the poet Jim is going toupdate these leggings because they liketo please the consumers more than moreso than other Aliexpress sellers so makesure to follow me on Instagram andeverything to keep your eyes out for anyupdated versions of these because Ithink they also said they might makethem without the logo so keep your eyesout and sorry I don't have more to sayabout these but I was kind ofdisappointed because I love thehigh-waisted flex next I want to talkabout new poems new like unique leggingsthat are theirs which are the energyseamless moral colors first of all lookat these colors for summer people I meanthese are just beautiful this coralcolor is definitely my favorite I love anice neon coral this super pretty tealblue color and then this nice littlemagenta pink color so a few details ofthese leggings basically they are samethe same shape in structure as theenergy seamless leggings they havea thick ribbed waistband they have somecontour detailing they have the energyeyeletsand then they have more eyelets at thebottom of the legging they also have alittle panel detailing down the legs aswell which is the same as the originalenergy seamless so I watched Deniseandres video on these because this washer collaboration with nepal gym whichis really cool but she said that sheadded the vital seamless booty contourto these and these at least the ones igot in the ones that everyone else hasbeen telling me about does not have thevital seamless booty contouring and whatshe means by the vital seamless bootycontouring is a little dot contouringand these just have the regular energyseamless contouring which is just thisvery very subtle little like littleextra compressive region so it doesn'treally do like a ton for your bootyhonestly i feel like these are prettyflattering on the booty anyway so idon't think it's really necessarybut yeah i just know that she was sayingthat those were the details on theleggings and a lot of people areordering these leggings and that is notshowing up on the leggings i don'treally know what the story with that ismaybe they had a bunch of these leggingsalready made without that contouring andthey were selling those so i'm notreally sure but mine does not have thatgoing to contour detailing some morethings to know about these leggings theyare true to size I wear my normal sizesmall it compared to the actual energyseamless from Nepal Jen these aredefinitely a little stiffer and rougherI personally preferred the solid colorsjust because they had so much stretch tothem at least the updated versions theyactually had a ton of stretch to themand these are also super supercompressive so I would assume thatthey're also pretty cellulite friendlybecause they're so compressive and theyalso have that Marel detail whichdefinitely helps with cellulite as wellpersonally for me the morrow fabric haskind of like an itchy like more roughtexture I know some people don't mind itbut for me it's just like a little lesscomfortable than the slick material ofthe original ener-d seamless and as foreach color most colors are very similarI felt like the peach color was thetiniest bit stretchy or than the othercolors but they were all overall prettystretchy and as for a squat crudenessthey weren't entirely squat proof forany of the colors the teal were about a6 out of 10 squat proof Ness so notgreat the magenta is for about an 8 outof 10 actually so these were probablythe most squat proof out of all thecolors which was great and the coral Imean the corals were honestly prettysheer guys these were probably like a 3out of 10 squat proof nests sodefinitely don't want to wear them on anactual leg day even leaning over toomuch you could probably see a decentamount through these leggings which iskind of disappointing because I know ina podium really it likes to make theirlooking squat proof so not really surewhat happened here but weak so yeah thatis basically it for the energy seamlesstomorrow leggings and now I'm just goingto quickly go over some of the vitalseamless sets I have done an in-depthreview of the new colors of the Vidalseamless leggingsexcept for this pink color but we'regonna go over squat weakness of all ofthem and I also have reviewed the vitalseamless tops and sports bras so I'mjust gonna go over a few details andshow you how they fit on me andeverything so for the leggings Irecommend sizing down a full size in allof the leggings in all colors I tried onall of these colors in a size extrasmall and they all fit me very well Ididn't feel like they were too tight onthe butt or the seams and the waistbandfit me with no gaping definitely sizedown and all of the vital seamlessleggings this includes new colors andthe old colors these new colors are alsovery very stretchy much more stretchythan the old colors actually which iswhy I do love them a lot more I didn'treally use to be a huge vital seamlessfan but now honestly I am just goingover the squat proof ness of each ofthese this light pink color was about a6 out of 10 squat proof so not great butI couldn't see like too much but they'rejust a very light color and they're verystretchy so not entirely squat proof theBlues I'll give a 7 out of 10 for squakroughness I actually wore these on alikeday the other day and I was totally finewith it you really can't see like thatmuch I when I filmed my squat tests I'min front of a bright ring light and it'sdefinitely a lot more visible than ifyou're just in the gym squatting sothese were 7 out of 10 and they were OKwith me for a light daythe Maroons were actually pretty good Igive them an 8 out of 10 squat proof soyeah these were decent but the blackones unfortunately we're about a 6 outof 10 squat proof it is hard to makeblack leggings squat proof because whenyou squat the black isin contrast look like a light skin tonelike mine it just looks a lot more sheerso yeah these were about a six out often there's definitely some Sheerness soI wouldn't wear those on a leg daypersonally the bras definitely feel likea lighter support than the originalviola seamless sports bras I thinkbecause this new vinyl seamless materialis so much stretchier that it doesn'tquite have the same structure as theother one the other ones were definitelya little stiffer and more structured sothe bras actually gave me a decentamount of support these are definitely alight medium support the fabric is justso super stretchy and lightweight but ifyou don't really need a lot of supportif you don't have a very large chestthen these are totally fine somethingshould not about the bras you'll see onthe Tryon you know the ones wearingright now because they're so thin andlightweight you can actually see thepads a little bit which isn't myfavorite thing in the whole world Idon't really like being able to see thepads so I don't know if this fabric isjust like a little thinner but I wouldappreciate if they could make the fabricthicker on the tops they do usuallyupdate their Bible seamless collectionsand make the fabric thicker they didthat for the last vital seamless sohopefully they do that for the bras aswell because you can also definitely seethe pads in this light color pink aswell and the tops I've already reviewedthe tops as well but I love these longsleeve tops because so many long-sleevecrop tops especially Jim sharks theyusually crop them - like right here soif you lift your arms up you can see thebra but you cannot see o these becausethey've actually made these a decentlength crop top so you're only showing afew inches of skin which is really niceso I definitely would recommend thesetops over Jim truckstops honestly theonly thing about these tops is that thislittle like sleeve part they do havethumb poles the sleeve part it's just alittle bit compressive for me and it'slike a little tight on my wrist so ifyou have like big hands or wrists orsomething maybe size up but I do wear asize small in the tops and I have a fullin-depth review on the leggings but likeI said these are one of my favoritepairs of leggings these days thewaistband and you correct size doesn'tstretch out and is super compressive andflattering the whole leggings they'rejust so super stretchy and honestly Ithink mixing and matching some of theseoutfits like a little blue top pinkbottoms would be super cute and justperfect for summerso yeah I hope you enjoyed this likekind of like half haul half review stylevideo we had a lot to get through butyeah I tried on a lot of leggingsyesterday guys and my hands are honestlypaying the price so if you liked thisvideo I'll link some other Aliexpressreviews hello over here so you have someoptions to choose from if you want towatch anything next stick you guys somuch for watching and I will see younext

this video is why do Isound nasally oh check it out dedicatedfor life team furious pick that up at ata min Germany when I was chillin withfurious Pete at the gym shark booth andthat's what I wanted to touch base onguys is the trip to Germany I wanted toshow you guys love for being thereanybody who came out anybody who youknow said what's up wherever was that wewere in Germany traveling whether it wasan airport out in Germany out and aboutor at the expo itself it was a crazycrazy event and I kind of regretted notmaking a video like this for the Arnoldwhich is a the last biggest event we didbut we flew out to Germany to do thefeeble expo this past weekend I floatwith Matt Christian and ChristianChristian guzmán came out with VinceGarza they met up and they came out toGermany as well furious pete and marcfitt came from canada very cool guys andwe all and then we met up with a jibshot crew out there jib shot crewmeaning you know the two owners and thentheir friends / co-workers guys thatworked for jib shark out in the UK so weall of us flew to Germany and met upthere and just had some epic times itwas a crazy weekend basically whathappened was a man died were scheduledto fly out tuesday from san francisco ataround 4pm and take a direct flight 11hour flight to frankfurt germany andthen take an hour trainto cologne which is where the Expos inme which is where our hotel was whathappened once we got to the airport andapparently the Lufthansa pilots which isthe airline that we were going to flywith our on strike so a pilot strike foran airline so that's crazy so everybodywas there just it was just a wreck theairline was trying to figure out what todo they were taking everybody on acase-by-case basis and taking you knowtaking taking our tickets and andactually seeing what airline they couldget us on to get us out to where weneeded to be you know to our finaldestination so we were in contact withJim shark and letting them know thatthere might be a chance that we mightnot even be you know make it on a flightout there so luckily we did instead ofbeing one flight in the net an hourtrain ride it was actually way worse wehad to take a plane from San Franciscoto London UK and then from London hanother plane to Munich Germany and thenfrom Munich Germany another planet ookalong which is where we were going to bewith you know a few hours in betweenlayover and stuff like that so basicallywe left San Francisco um tuesday ataround four around five pm and wearrived in the city in germany where weneeded to be at our hotel about 6 p-6 to7 p.m. wednesday the next day so thatscrewed up the schedule you know our ourinternal schedules and just yeah so itdidn't start off on that you know on agood note but obviously there's there'sthere's like nine hour differencebetween Germany and California but stillit was it was a journey so we gotthinner we got to sleep the first nightyou know seven eight hours which waswhich is good and then Thursday was thebeginning of the expo so we didn'treally have time to do anything beforethe expo day started Thursday morningyou know we all met up for breakfast isthe routine every day we met up forbreakfast at eight in the morning youknow all you can eat in the in theGerman hotel you know Gaga got ourforgot a lot of food in because itwouldn't be eating throughout the dayand headed to the expo Thursday waspretty crazy Friday was pretty crazy butthey were corporate days or you knowbasically people who had hookups orpeople who were affiliated withcompanies were lonely people a below andi think the tickets were sold out forthursday and friday but apparently whatI had heard was saturday and sunday wassold out for the FIBA expo meaning theyweren't selling any more tickets and Iwas crazy to me because I've never heardof an expo not something you knowtickets anymore especially an expo ofthat caliber apparently it's the biggestexponent world from what I've heard andafter seeing I can believe it there'slike 10 different halls and it's afour-day Expo but basically what thatmeant was there was going to be at leastfour times the amount of people that wesaw on Thursday and Friday come onSaturday and Sunday so I was like youknow we'll see Thursday and Friday werejust you know good traffic um you knowsales were done at the gym shark boothand you know we had good times but noneof us none of us except for maybe Petebecause he had been there beforeexpected the traffic that we got onSaturday it was complete carnage at thegym shark booth we didn't even have agood location and in one massiverecord-breaking day at a gym shark boothJim shark actually sold out of amajority of everything on Saturday looklike we got stampeded by Oh gross it wasinsane Matt and I were talking to youknow legends of aesthetic supporters youto support us but anybody who you knoweven comments or writes us or talks tous on any social media platform that wasthere was there to have a good time andwe were having a very good time as wellyou know despite being tired but that'swhat we were there for so it was anamazing amazing time we were there i'dsay from nine in the morning until about6pm didn't have

market segmentation is a process manybusinesses useto identify their target market andfully understand their wants and needsthis video explores the concept ofmarket segmentationwith supporting examples by applying theprocess involved to gymshark[Music]market segmentation is a business toolwhich aids businesses such as gymsharkto divide up the market or potentialcustomers into groupswhich are known as segments these arebased on several factors andcharacteristicsthese commonly include locationdemographicsbehavior lifestyle and incomethe key reason for market segmentationis based on the vast differencesbetween the needs and wants of peoplefor example if we set up a businessselling t-shirts todayand just aim to sell one generic designto the whole marketthe chances are we may not attract manycustomers at allas we fail to meet anyone's specificneeds or wantstherefore businesses segment the marketinto groups of peopleaccording to their differing wants andneeds this allows them to effectivelyfocusand tailor their products and associatedmarketing campaignsat them specifically once potentialcustomers have been split up intosegmentsthe business is unable to analyze eachone in turn to assess the potentialprofitabilityor long-term growth of each one with theaim of targeting a specific segmentor collection of segments to markettheir products toand maximize sales and profitabilityonce the business has decided onspecific segments of the market it willbe aiming its products and services atit will then develop and apply anappropriate marketing mixto attract and convert this specifictarget market into paying customerslet's take a look at the different typesof market segments in more detailand some examples of market segmentationat gymsharksplitting up the market by the locationof potential customersis also known as geographicalsegmentation and is essentially based onwhere the market livebusinesses have a wide range of optionswhen it comes to the product it offersaccording to the target markets locationand often choose to alternate theirproduct offering according to thelocation of their customersthis is more apparent in globalbusinesses such as mcdonald'swhose menu varies across the worldaccording to the location of theircustomersfor example in france they have the macbaguetteand in the philippines the speciality isthe mcricebergergymshark have grown from a startup in2012 where founder ben francis and agroup of his high school friendsgot taught how to sell by his grandmaand produce the early products in hisparents garagethis has now escalated into a globalbusiness which now operates within 131countrieshowever unlike mcdonald's the coreproducts at gymshark remain the sameregardless of the customer's locationthe business was founded on a beliefthat young gym goers wanted to look andfeel good going to the gymso ben francis had a vision of providingthem with functional gym wearwhich performed well and looked verygood which remains trueregardless of where the customer islocateddemographic segmentation is based on thecharacteristics of the target marketand include age gender racereligion and sexual orientation amongstmany othersconsidering the demographics of thetarget market and the productsuitability for themis vital for any business for examplemcdonald's targets the age demographicof young children with their happy mealoptionproviding a smaller quantity of foodwith healthier options such as carrotsticksalongside a novelty item including a toyor a bookwhich allows the business to attract andengage the younger audiencewith the potential of turning them intoa lifelong loyal customerwhereas a business such as asos whichsells dresses and trainers amongst otheritemsare targeting the gender demographic ofwomen looking to buy what they call thefreshest fashionat an affordable price gymshark of avery clear target demographic which itaims its products at their main targetmarket in relation to demographics isbased on agewith a clear audience of 18 to 25 yearolds of any gendergymshark known understand the wants andneeds of their audienceand have succeeded in reaching themthrough not only developing the productsto meet their wants and needsbut by using extremely effectivepromotional methods via theirsocial media platforms and they've gotover five million followers on thosecombined with the use of influencerswhich this demographic followand take inspiration fromjim shark are actually famous for beingone of the early adopters of theinfluencer marketing modelwithin the health and fitness industrywithin which they effectively targetedthis demographicthrough youtubers including lex griffinand nikki blackettaamongst many others behavioralsegmentation predominantly relates tothe consumer buying behaviorand how it varies between industries andspecific segments of the marketfor example some businesses will see anupturn in sales at christmaswhile other businesses such as thosewhich specialize in garden equipment forexamplewill thrive during the summer it's veryimportant for businesses to be aware ofthe behaviors of their target marketto ensure they plan production of theirproducts accurately andexecute effective marketing campaigns atthe right timejim shark's products tend to sell allyear roundand experience seasonal peaks alongsidethe usual peaksin the health and fitness industryhowever a very effective way in whichgymshark use the behavior of theirtarget market to their advantageis through the use of sales theytypically hold two major sales each yearand the black friday one is arguablytheir most effective and attractive totheir customer basea great example is for a marketingcampaign named blackoutwhich utilize their target markets fearof missing out by running a week-longsale starting on monday at 3 pmuntil the end of the week with acountdown timer showing how long thesale had leftwhich influenced their behavior andincreased impulse purchasesthese types of sales have led to gymsharks selling 90 percent of theirproductsin just one day in the pastsegmenting the market by a lifestyle isfocused on the hobbiesand interests of people alongside theirwants and needs according to the type oflife they leadthe rapid rise of veganism and increaseof vegan options available atrestaurants and supermarkets to theircustomersis a clear example of businessesidentifying a recent change in thelifestyle choicesof many of their customers in specificsegmentsof the market with many businessesreacting toand targeting this audience such assubway releasing plant-based productswhich include the meatless meatballmarinara and tastes like chicken substhe market segment of lifestyle is oneof the most important characteristics ofa customer at gymsharkand focusing on the segment you couldargue has been the main factor in theirgrowth and success to dategymshark have a clear target audience of18 to 25 year oldswhose lifestyles revolve around fitnessfashionand music once jim shark identified thelifestyle choices of its target audiencethe business was able to effectivelytarget their products at themthrough a series of well-executedmarketing strategies based around theirlifestyle choiceshobbies and areas of interestthe final segment which is commonlyassessed by businessesis income this segment is focused on howmuch the typical person earnsand how much disposable income they haveit's a crucial factor for any businessto considerbefore they launch their product ortarget a specific segment of the marketfor example businesses such as tesla androlexclearly target a segment of the marketwhich have high earning potentialand high amounts of disposable incomewhereasbusinesses such as alde target a segmentof the market which mainly have a lowerearning potentialand not as much disposable income ascustomers of competitors such as weightrowsgymshark targets a market of customerswho have high levels of disposableincomebut not necessarily higher earningpotential due to the age of their targetmarket being slightly youngeralthough their gym wear is pitched asaffordable it's still at the higher endof the market in line with competitorssuch as nikein comparison to businesses which targettheir gym wear products to customerswith lower levels of disposable incomewhich include boohoo or primark gymsharkhave been very successful when targetingthis segment of the marketas they are willing to pay the premiumprice due to the high in qualityfashionable gym wear which is designedto shape to fitslimming and be tight in all the rightplaces effectively meeting the needs andwants of the target marketnow that we have looked at variousexamples of market segmentation inactionit's important to understand thepotential benefits and drawbacks ofconductingmarket segmentationlet's start with the benefits the keybenefit of usingmarket segmentation for a business suchas gym shark is that the process enablesthem to understandand meet the needs of their customersmore effectively this is very clear atgymsharkas a business clearly meets the needsand wants of its target marketand act upon these by doing so it hasled to gymshark achieving increasedbrand loyaltyand repeat custom whilst at the sametimereducing price sensitivity around thebrand allowing gymshark to charge ahigher price for their productsand the target market being happy to payit which has ultimately increased therevenueand profitability of the business whichhas grown from a startup in 2012to a reported 1.3 billion dollar brandin 2020 however it's important tounderstand some of the potentialdrawbacks of conducting marketsegmentationa key drawback is the potential forincreased costsnot just while conducting the analysisof the market initiallybut the increased research anddevelopment costs involved when abusiness develops and produces productsto meet the needs and wants of varioussegments of the marketalongside this marketing to a wideraudience and more segments over timewill also cost more money as the messagecommunicated is likely to alteraccording to the varying wants and needsof the target marketas the business aims at differentsegments which will increase the amountof marketing activities requiredmarket segmentation can also lead to abigger product range as the businesstries to meet the wants and needs ofmore people within various segments ofthe marketwhich can cause a business to lose sightof its core purposeor values and cause confusion forcustomerspotentially leading to the brand to loseits identityand be less able to exploit economies ofscalegymshark are a fantastic example ofmarket segmentation being conductedand executed effectively by a businessto support the growth of their brandthey have focused purely on just a fewspecific segments of the marketwith age and lifestyle being the mostnotable characteristics of its targetmarketonce these were identified they targetedthem with well-executed marketingmainly through social media andinfluencersoffering products which met their wantsand needs in terms of both quality andstyleat a price they are willing to pay dueto their earning potential anddisposable income levelsso that's it market segmentation i hopeyou found the video usefuland if you have don't forget to give ita like and subscribe to teachers youtubechannelfor

that foods are notcreated nutritionally equaland then apple would probably be a morenutritious choice than a chocolate barbut by making them morally equal we canremove their power over usand in turn reduce our desire to bingeon them in excessthere is nothing wrong with enjoying funfoods like chocolate regularlyeven daily as long as they're notcrowding out other nutritiousfoods in the diet but based on what i'veseen on your channeli really applaud you for promoting agenerally balanced approach to foodand for normalizing eating these oftendemonized foods in moderationespecially in the fittest world whererestriction is often praisedall right based on legal advice i'mgonna stop after these final three tosummarize he then tried to ridiculeexercises like the hundredssaying that it was

wassix foot a younger brother 6 foot whenolder brothers the same height my dad istaller hopefully a grow a couple inchesi would love to be six feet awesome andmy current body fat level right now Idon't know last time I had it measuredwas when I took my personal trainingcourses and that was back in Septemberof last year and I was eighteen percentthere I was cutting up time I am cuttingright now I'm dieting down and tell andthat's a little bit information about menow I'm going to go and go over somefrequently asked questions or somethingthat you might beif you're just now getting into weightlifting what you have in weightliftingif you've been waiting the pig a whilethis might not pertain to you but it'sthe most common question that I gotplease so weird at a sporting goodsstore and then wanting to start weightlifting do they need gloves you needweightlifting clothes and basically thisdepends and I say it depends because youcan see people that go out to like homedepot by those gardening gloves or get adollar tree if you have one or dollargeneral whatever your dollar goodstories and you can get the like ofgardening gloves they work just the samebut they're a little bit thicker andthen look torquay to wear to say apublic gym if you have your own home gymthis might not be an issue for you sodisregard that but you usually go toyour sporting goods store you find liketo be a pair that's eleven dollars andthen it'll be one eyes a little bit morepadding so it's like twenty dollarsadatha brands on it might be $22 buy abrand like the under armour going 24.9depending and if you're going to go forweightlifting love and I recommend it ifyou're just starting or if you have thatwould think a little bit and your handsare hurting from like saving grip on thebar I would go ahead and look for aglove that does not have stitching herethis the palm area of your hand likeright around here if you do I've noticedfrom the Paris to the iphone the past apharbinger or Nike or under armour not in10 Americans they don't have a stitch inthere from pairs of iphone but that partwill always rip you know might be sixmonths down the road but it's kind ofrip and then you're going to buy anotherpair of gloves and that's going to costyou another twenty twenty thirty dollarsyou know what's the point I personallyhave not been wearing gloves in the pastyear and a half my calluses are prettythick and I have a bad habit of pickingat them but I haven't worn any callusesI do not do any power licking of thesort a more bodybuilding if you couldn'ttell thank youthat's my really opinion on gloves justthis question really covers if you're ina dinner advanced intermediate whateverthe type of equipment that you need nowI would always recommend black pair ofshoes whether they be bands or chucksavoid the Chuck to generate like thesecond generation later bought out byNike so they use the new lunar foam inthem thinking more comfortable and thenut they're not flat anymore I mean theyare but the cushion just it's not goodfor squatting if you canI got my gym bag here and what i haveand i bought a pair of a deep hoursthese guys right here and hope they areyou can see that they're flat are theyrequired absolutely not I just watchingsome chucks I bought those time ago istill wear in the gym I love my chucksnow this also is bringing it the secondpiece of equipment and that's aweightlifting belt now I'm sure you'veseen everyone got those fancy class onesand you get these traditional style hereand you see the velcro ones avoid thevelcro I wouldn't recommend it so whatyou really want to look for in the beltis how thick it is that's really goingto determine the comfort level beforeyou and how you like it I prefer alittle bit thinner like you saidmillimeter brushes like a 11 or 13 whichyou can certainly find and then on thetopic of like leg day kind of thinksgonna get a pair of knee sleeves anytraps are annoying and irritating to dowith so if you can deal with that that'sfine I personally owned a pair of eastleaves I have pad wraps in the passagethat I did not like them so these areour from your deck lifting I can seethat and it came up on this one and Ibought these about i bought theseabout two months ago and i absolutelylove them i will drop a link down belowin the description box i think you couldpick these up right now for about fortydollars 48 care and this is the sevenmillimeter like this and the reason irecommend it is to keep your knees veryworn measure yourself with likemeasuring tape to order your like rightin the middle go ahead and order sizedown but if you're like half the topsize of the chart like I meant it at thetop medium and I just went ahead orderedimmediately said I would have gone smallbut I'm going to be bulking too early sothey might become too tight I don't wantto order another pair and then lastthing that I would think someone wouldneed in their gym equipment if you don'twear gloves and you want an option to itlike you are doing it back so you'redoing or pulled a or back day or if youwant to call it and you don't have thegrip strength where you do but on thatthird fourth fifth set you know yourscripts getting out you can totally getthis extra reps if you had the gripstrength I'm going to recommend likegetting a pair of Bursa grips yeah righthere awesome and what they do our stuffat one on yours just putting right herethen tight and maybe this basically youcan wrap the bar around here you can dopull-ups you knew your Rose anything youwant wrap it on here you don't even haveto use it all the time if you just wantprotect your palm cuz you don't want towear a glove you can totally just do itlike this as well I like these becausethey're stiff but I used to have a pairtheir flimsy they got the job done butthey were just irritating atime-consuming justsure them the bar and may God be asefficient as possible so i will also puta link for these in the description boxbelow everything will be in amazon ibelieve they're all prime shipping so ifyou have that take advantage of it nowi'm going to talk about a couple piecesof equipment that aren't necessary tohave but you know they totally help oneit would be resistance bands of a sortof interesting a resistance band forwarming not stretching great i'drecommend one and then a weight beltlike dipping belt if you want to addsome way to your chest dips or yourtricep dips or pull ups this is a greateasy way to add weight and be safe aboutit this is a harbinger I will also put alink to this description box below Iwouldn't recommend adding wait untilyour form is good or you can get atleast 12 or three sets easily none ofthat covers it for equipment wise youdon't need a whole lot to get in the gymif you're just starting off I feltminimum developdinner it's nice their place you knowanything herniating out of your stomachit's not kind of fun now the nextquestion is what kind of clothes shouldyou wear the gym and the simple answeris whatever you're comfortable wearingnow keep in mind you should understandwhat your gym allows you to wear somegyms SE nota stringers can't wear it toomuch skin particularly for the males andI don't like to be nickel banged in theeyes you know a little annoying some gymrequired how but type of clothes youshould wear ain't brand does not matterit doesn't and you want to wearsomething that is not be tight but looseand is comfortable is breathable rubbermaterial that whips the way your sweatkeeps you nice and cool and so then alsobring it means the topic of you see allthese people wearing like Jim shark andif you're wanting yourself should youbuy some ginger clothing and that answeris completely up to you do I think it'snecessary to wear like these brandthings Jim shark on our Nike if youfollow Christian guzmán or Nikki blackowner or any of the Alpha Lee teambecause you notice i am wearing an alphaleague shirt and i love their missionstatement i love the whole idea behindthe company i especially love thatthey're from houston texas as myself andi love to support another Texan when ican and i one day hope to go to thealpha legion that's a whole differenttangent and hopefully is youtube videoand the reason I wear it well the guy asI just mentioned I hope one day to besponsored or at least you know helppromote the company in a good manner ina good viewpoint just by wearing theirclothes Oh promote the image of outbleep and I'll drop a link to theirmission statement in the districtso you can read it I personally myselfwant to purchase jib shark and the wholereason I say it depends you know youshould purchase it if you want to dolike clothing if you like the company goahead and buy the shirts father's upyeah it's very pricey you know and youknow that's what you get behind the mainpay that extra dollar idea behind a nameyou know whether it be nike under armouradidas or you know how police in my casewith jim chartered whatever company youpay that extra dollar for one qualityinto the names behind the company orbehind the shirt which is like and webuy these shirts when you wear into thegym you know that maybe somebody elsealso knows about that company they gowow they're wearing you know whateverand that's kind of like a boost to yourmorale you know give it a boost your egoa little bit too but you get that wholenew level of confidence that you arewearing something that you wouldn't haveworn before you started weightlifting orsomething you know you just lookdifferent to changed your style and thatto you can completely change your wholeperspective like it can boost yourconfidence it can increase your workoutperformance temporarily you know whethera placebo or not you know you boost yourworkout performance regardless you feelbetter and you just kill that work outyou know the first time wearingsomething and I knew that a lot of timesI you know if I'm noticing some of myequipment that i mentioned earlier isnow although you know how shaped I wouldsay and I buy a new piece of equipmentand I'm excited to use that like when ifirst got these shirts i was excited towear this the gym I could not wait toget inside and kill that work out findsomething you like Rep it excited towear it till that work out the nexttopic morning or is supplements whetheror not you should take them now all pinsthings on your situation they getsupplemented protein powder I think youshould take a protein shake if youcannot get it from your whole foods ifyou're just looking for a simple proteinI would recommend like a whey protein Imyself use gold standard protein byoptimum nutrition and i'll put myprotein down to the description as welland you know i take it because i can'tget all my protein from whole foods so igot do the supplement it into my dietthis whole idea behind supplements it'sto supplement not to become your onlysource so that's very important so ifyou just worked out a little bro sciencebut i always like to have a good amountof protein in my system right after workout my post workout and i also comesinto pre workouts take it if you want ityou know if you want anything a prettyworkouts going to help you go ahead andtake it make sure you do a littlereading behind the pre-workout firstbefore you get it i know your caffeinetolerance because when i first started ibought this thing from labrada it'scalled supercharged two point oh I flewoff the chain my heart was I didyou know and it was kind of fun I waslight of heart when it took it and solook up behind pre-workout right nowI've ready got a high tolerance to preworkout so I am cycling now a biggesttopic is creatine and what kind ofcreatine you should be taking certainpeople react to creatine differentlysome people are floated from it somepeople feel no bloating you know what soever and I personally don't get loadedfrom creatine so I take five grams everysingle day every day don't you knowcycle it you'll need a loaded five gramsa day you're covered for your female I'dsay three grams 55 really want to it butrecommended three and you see likecreatine monohydrate which is you shouldbe using if you notice you react Iwonders there's all sorts of cretins outthere and you might react to differenteach one come on we want to look out fordecreasing my hydrate super cheap canget about 200 sightings from op tonutrition like fifteen dollars so greatprice and then there's beta alaninecreatine beta-alanine are the two moststudied supplements and they're the mostproven to work and those are the twosupplements that I would recommendpersonally especially creatinebeta-alanine basically reduces thelactic acid buildup that you would getafter work out you know we first cutyou're like really sore beta alaninesupposed to help you leave that andincrease the recovery process I'll putsome articles in the description as welland then a quick one will talk about ismusic I have my own music playlist ify'all interested in my music playlist Iwill also put that in the descriptionand then y'all can listen to what Iwasn't doing well but it's going to beon Spotify and 501 I want to talk aboutis certain scenarios scenarios that Iwould say go see a doctor to see aphysician go see someone with a highermedical training you are experiencingany pain like if they're liking yourelbows joints go see a doctor don'tdebate it don't question don't go askthem the biggest guy in the gym or yourbest buddy who likes to work out don'task them they're going to all give youdifferent answers the simple one is goto your doctor that you can don't riskit if you're working out you notice yourshoulders hurting whether the from badfor more from a previous injury thatyou've heard past go see a doctor listento your body if you're hurting whileyou're working out stop crying we'regonna break something you're going tosnap something go see a doctor andyou'll hear a lot of other people if youask Miss conspecific license you knowwhether it be a bigger youtubers fitnessmodel whatever they're all I say itdepends and by depends it means go see adoctor as they are not medically ortrained or inclined to answer thosespecific kind of questions you should gosee a professional not saying that theyaren't but it's above their take gradesimple as that well guys this is a guydo it for the video thanks for watchinghopefully I have a couple of new

you guys this Wednesday the 4th of May2016 and it's my third day or bikiniprep that I'm vlogging today we'll callfeeling good quite energetic and I kindof felt heavy when I woke up I don'tknow I just felt like maybe I put onweight I went to weigh myself just nowand you can see it's a little bitlighter today overall was a pretty calmday in the morning I went to do legs Ihave only two leg sessions left until mybikini competition and my coach told methat the last week before thecompetition I shouldn't do like at allso this is my last week before the lastweek if you know what I mean and I'vedone one today and I did basically abunch of reps a lot of reps at the tagsquad I did leg presses at these lungesall types I did leg extension leg curlsand everything like that so I was prettyexhausted basically walked home likecomplete [ __ ] and one thing Istruggled with today all days energy soI've talked about home I was so tired Ihad protein shake and I couldn't eventhink about food I went for a nap I kindof slept on and off for a couple ofhours woke up still feeling pretty tiredand then I just had fish for lunch andfish for dinner and then I went to thelocal store and got some bit long if youdon't know what it is it's basicallylike a dry beef from South Africa and ithas very low fat very low carbon highprotein so this was like the snack I wasmunching on all afternoon and it justfelt so depressed and tired and I don'tmean to be negative in my videos everbut I just want to be real with you guysand to say that getting to the low bodyfat percentage than usual it definitelymesses up with your mind especially as agirl and right now I'm having somepersonal issues and definitely I feelthat being affected as well but on thepositive note I wanted to show a bit ofJim shark new stuff that I orderedincluding this top excuse my orangebrown just cannot be bothered to changeso this new range they have a seamlessand obviously I bought everything myselfI'm not sponsored at all so Jim sharkwanna sponsor me holla I'm joking but Iwill just show you a couple of thingsthat go from Jim shark so a little minihole I got this top in size small and Ialso got it in turquoise color but Ithought it's a very well fitting taupeit's pretty tight and again sorry aboutmy bra but it's just a nice top and it'squite short but it's not like a crazyshort that it's like not a crop style Ialso got these leggings I should gothere originally in two colors I've gotthem in all black and then this colorthis color is my favorite because I lovethe mesh on the side I love the highwaisted and also what Jim sharkintroduced with the new leggings is theside pocket so which is super handy ifyou have a phone and you just want toput it in or key lockers I just likethat and these are again full-lengthsuper comfortable and their squad prooflike there is no Sheerness at all sowell done Jim shark only proving yourSheerness and also I got the sameleggings in black but they are justcropped style I don't think it's worthshowing and yeah these are both sizemedium that I got so these ones arethese are the both size medium and supercool I love also the sight dry littlething that says right here I thinkthat's just very cool I think they'redefinitely improving on the branding andthis mesh is not each year all because Ihave a couple of ladies with mesh andthere have been itching but these arenot another tank I got it's basicallythe same as this one but in turquoisecolor so I got this loose why I thinktop just on purpose because as Imentioned before in my videos I like tofeel quite covered up unless I'm workingout with a friend or somebody else Idon't like to feel like I'm revealing oranything like that I just like to get inmy zone and work out so this is perfectit's loose on the waist it's a bitlonger at the balm so whenever you'redoing any squats and sometimes you getlike little sweat patches or whateveryou just feel comfortable and it'sbreathable you can also wear it with asports but I think because it's quitehigh on the cleavagearea but then you just get like a sideboob size bra thing which is pretty fineI think another thing I wanted to talkto you about briefly today is the timingof everything in terms of beautypreparation so basically as a bikinigirl you have way more things to preparefor than a guy so naturally you need tobook your pan like a couple of weeks inadvance which I did I'm going toactually have a tan on Friday and myshow is on Saturday and the lady told methat because the show is at 10:00 in themorning I need to do it quite late inthe afternoon on Friday because if I doit on Saturday morning time won't haveenough time to show up fully on my skinso I'm doing that on Friday night alsofor Saturday morning I booked hairmakeup and the lady told us that youhave to look like a drag queen becausewhenever you're on stage and from farawayif you have natural makeup or evenstronger makeup you can't even see itproperly so you have to have propermakeup fake eyelashes big hair likereally dark lips or bright lips she saysnude lips are the worst because it lookslike you just have no lives on stage andbecause of the all the bright lights aswell and then do hope that the FaceCamlady I will ask her strongly not to turnmy face just from the neck down becauseI want to just wear bronzer in my faceand my skin is not ideal as you know andI get very sensitive skin and I justrather have makeup that I can wash offand get on with itLaura having like clogged pores withorange tan so for the tan which is anexactly ten days the lady told us tobasically start exfoliating two weeksprior so I've been exfoliating prettymuch every other day gently and maybeonce a week quite harshly just to getrid of all the dead skin so that whenyou do get a spray tan and get on verysmoothly and evenlyof course outfit so I have mycompetition shoes which have shown youbriefly in one of the videos just when Iwas posing and also other to competitionbikinis which I don't want to reveal yetbecause I want you to have like a WOWfactor whenever you see the video whenI'm on stage but they're great bikini isdefinitely a lot of crystals sparklesand whenever you put them on you feelvery like pushed up because bronze likethisthick and this padded so you definitelyfeel like you're quite a showgirl lookbecause of all the crystals you have tobe very careful when you put it onbecause it's crazy scratchy like whattried 1 bikini on and I had likescratches all over my legs and one morething in terms of beauty that I need toprepare is doing like mani-pedi so Ineed to get some nails done I willprobably do like shellac the ones thatlast couple of weeks I don't want to dolike crazy gel nails because I don'tlike when they're long and my nails andnaturally fragile so the nails will needto be done next week other than that I'mjust trying to wear as less makeup as Ican every single day that's why I'm notcrazy like glammed up with my videosright now because I just wants to let myskin breathe and be comfortable for theshow ideally I want to also get aphotographer who will take kind ofprofessional pictures of me or semiprofessional because while I'm dietingdown right now it would be such a way tohave like the lowest body fat percentageI probably had in a while and not haveany proof or any memory of it ratherthan just some random shots on stagewhich I'm not even guaranteed will bethat great obviously I have my own alingerie little online shop that I'mrunning I feel quite overwhelmed and Iknow what they say whenever you're doinga competition anything super Fitnessactive you feel lazy in all other areasand this is true but this is not becauseyou feel lazy but because you naturallyfeel exhausted you feel like sleepingall the time and your hormones areplaying up so I hope I feel okaytomorrow thanks so much for watching andeven today I felt so down I was like ohmaybe I shouldn't even do a video butthen I remembered my commitment to youguys and I decided to do a vlog everysingle day so stay tuned for tomorrow'syou tomorrow bye,22,UCFzGgfAdQ--UseEYvf7ifYA,AnastasiaOva,22,11,0,225,"['gymshark', 'gym shark', 'gymshark leggings', 'leggings',

of gymsharkover the past few yearsin 2014 gymshark sold 5.8 million ofclothing and accessoriesdoes the marketing available of jimshark make you envious and shockedtoday i will take you to dig into thesecret of jim shark's successthe success of jim sharp can be dividedinto two stagesthe early poverty period and the laterfunding periodin the early days gem shark did not haveenough funds for brand buildingbut it formed the jim shark modelgym shark was founded in 2012. at thattimethere was a serious market problem insports athletes either wore looseunfit clothes and they were expensive orthey can choose another kind of clothesthat focuses on performance but doesn'tlook goodben the founder of jim shark was only 19years old in 2012and he was also a sports fan he createdgymshark for only one purpose which wasto design a series of clothes that fitand look goodor to make a clothe he wants to wearthis is the first lesson we need tolearnappropriate needs ben repeatedlydiscussed that he was the target userindeed he was 19 years old and a sportsfanaccording to his own situation hetargeted the user to adolescent malesaged 15 to 25.so began the production of the firstclose ben did

on this episode Tuesday's summer first2015 hit up the back and biceps nikeremai leo tues and jim shark clothingand do pre workouts really make adifference enjoy good morning YouTube itis seven thirty in the morning headed tothe gym natural bodies fitness I have aback and bicep day-to-day focus onhypertrophy some for the most part itwill be lighter weights higher repranges really to get the blood flowingand again my focus my mind set on thesetypes of exercises to really get my formreally concentrate on my breathing allthese other factors to help my overallperformance so that when I'm reallytrying to push the limit as far asweights go I'll have everything in placeor at least that's the hope get my bodytrained up for that but even in Ihypertrophy days you can still makegains you can still PR because as youget stronger you the load that you'reusing should start to increase whetherthat's weights whether that's more repswhether that's less rest time in betweeneach set let's utter so there's so manyways to make gain even on hypertrophydays so no matter what your focus is forthe day on your workout always strive tomake that extra game whatever it is andthere's many ways to do that okay topicof the day do pre workout to really makea difference that's a good questionbecause um you know I know a lot ofpeople especially if you're firststarting out are wondering you knowthere's all this stuff about preworkouts I see people taking them allthe time I'm considering it but I don'tknow what it is or what I should doshould I take one is it really worth itfirst of all let me just say that youdon't need anyuh plement to have a good workout youdon't need any supplement to achieveyour goals when it comes to your fitnessplan and etc supplements I would justsay are like icing on the cake becausenumber one here's a con for pre workoutis they're expensive so a lot of timespeople just don't have the money for itand that's okay a lot of times all youneed really if you want you know becausea big thing about pre workouts is thatit has a some caffeine in it to get youawake and stimulated so some people willjust have some black coffee before theywork out just as good or even caffeinepills and again really caffeine is justa way to wake your body up to helpstimulate you and so that you're you'reready to go during your workout so thatis a potential con to take in apre-workout other con is that peoplereact plenty to pre workouts I know withsome that I've taken even the first timeI've taken them it made me feel funnyjust because of all the ingredients thatare in it to help you try to focus andthe caffeine and all of this stuff andI'm not really sensitive to caffeine butagain it could make me feel funny andtwo if you're if you have a sensitivestomach where you drink it on an emptystomach it could give you the bubbleguts and nothing is worse than going tothe gym with the bubble guts because thewhole time you're just trying to getthrough your work out so that you canjust let it all out I'm going to put itout there okay so pros does it reallyaffect you my answer and my experienceis yespre workouts have affected my workout ina positive way despite some of the consthat I mentioned the focus is prettygood in fact nowadays I do drinkpre-workout almost every time because ithelps me one it helps me get energy butto it also does help me focus andthere's just a lot of ingredients therethat's what it's geared to do now willpre workouts make you lift 100 extrapounds on a certain move absolutely notthat it won't do that it won't give yousuperhuman strength what it will do isit will stimulate your body and get yourbody ready to a point that it's a primeto work out and that's really what it'sfor for me I can best describe that asit gets you to that warmed up phase alot faster and that's what you want youwant your body to be warmed up whenyou're ready to go so just a word ofcaution when you're taking pre workoutsread the ingredients make sure thecaffeine levels are appropriate for youbecause not all pre workouts on the sameamount of caffeine there are some thathave just a little bit and there aresome that have a lot and I've taken alot through the spectrum I've taken c4I've taken Jack I've taken Jekyll andHyde I've taken a pep test bulk which iswhat I'm on now so there's just a bunchof them out there and my bestrecommendation is to just research themmake sure that the ingredients are okaywith you that you know you check with adoctor so overall pretty workouts yesthey do affect your workout in apositive waybut they're not necessary and so don'tfeel like you're missing out if you'renot taking a pre-workout final word isthat with pre workouts I've used themfor weight training I have not used themfor doing cardio or CrossFit or any typeof sports training and so I don't knowhow it'll affect you if you are doingone of those types of training becauseit will with those trainings your heartrate is much more elevated so I'm notsure how the pre workout will affect youin those things so just a word ofcaution my opinions on this is strictlyrelated with weight training alrightthat's the topic for the day i will giveyou guys a commentary at the gym andi'll see you on the next clip alrightstarting off this back and bicep daywith weighted pullups not as heavy aslast time because i'm going for eightreps instead of five so 15 poundsinstead of 25 and i was able to hit allmy sets even though my last set i wasreally grinding on the last rep but I'llcount it anyways and I think next timeI'm I don't know if next time I'll gofor 20 pounds or 17 and a half we'll seecuz it was pretty heavy on that last sett-bar Rose going 70 pounds I did 70pounds last time but I went 48 Rebs so Isaid you know what let me just try 70pounds again but this time go for 10reps and I was able to hit 10 reps onall my sets I was pretty difficult forme but that's a good PR for me and goodprogress so lat pulldown close grip hereI want to focus on squeezing these labsI lean back and pulling it to my chestbut again I'm focusing on my latsfocusing on sweet focusing on squeezingmy shoulder blades together leading withmy elbows not you trying not to use mybiceps for the move and really my handsare just acting like hooks that areholding on to the attachment but youreally want to focus on those lats andhere with the one-arm dumbbell bent overrows focusing on the lower part of myback so I'm rowing it rightright to the side of my belly buttonthere and so you can see that I'mpulling it right up there but i'mthinking the same thing i'm thinking ofmy shoulder blade going to meet my othershoulder blade i'm trying to get myshoulder blades that touch the otherside and so obviously that's impossiblebut i won't say impossible because idon't know it may have been done but Ipretty sure it's impossible and so thesame thing on the other side again keepthe chest high sometimes it helps for meto look forward to remember to keep thechest high but when you're doing manyreps like this I like to use versagroups by the way on these so that youknow it just doesn't it saves my grip Itry not to use them if I don't have tobut if I feel my grip starting to comedown then I'll definitely throw theversa grips on there because really Iwant to squeeze everything out of myback and then final back movement wasthis rope lat pulldown 20 reps sohypertrophy definitely focused here onlydid 50 pounds really light again justnice slow and controlled even though theweight is lighter focus on every part ofthe movement and really squeeze at thebottom and I'm telling you by the timeyou get to 20 and after you do a bunchof sets of these your lats will be onfire and I and I really like thisprogram because one thing I was tryingto do the season was grill my lats and Ifeel like it does have a good amount oflat work in there and so I'm reallyexcited about that you can see makingthe poop face so you know that it'sgetting really hard and so now moving onjust a couple of bicep moves barbellbicep curl just 40 pounds I did 40pounds last time for eight reps thisthis time it called for 10 reps so Ifigured I'd just try to go for it ididn't hit 10 reps on all my sets i wasable to hit it for the first one and thesecond one but that's okay so i thinki'll try to stick to this weight and tryto hit it 410 on all my steps next timeand then finally is hammer curls just 20pounds so really lightweight but again15 reps here on all my sets and I wasable to hit it although my form was kindof taken a little bit of a hitand I'd say the end of this the secondset and beyond but again just a prettygood burn on the biceps not too muchthere but hope you guys enjoyed theworkout i'll post the entire thing inthe log and i'll see you guys on thenext clip alright what's up guys i'mhere at harris teeter i am checking outthis online grocery thing for the firsttime let's see if it really is worthfive dollar fee here it is apparently ialready ordered we ordered last nightand so I'm just press the button see howthis thing works yes I'm here to pick upmy order it's veux des I thank youalright so there's my personal shopperwalking back in she just came in gave mea receipt and you know showed me thethings that they couldn't find and Ichecked on the thing no substitution sothere were a few things that they didn'thave and they didn't sub it becausethat's what I chose but I did ask whatif I had picked the substitution theywould find the most comparable thinggive me a call and let me know if it'sokay if the item if the comparable itemhappened to be more expensive they wouldnot charge me the extra price they wouldkeep it at whatever price the originalpurchase was for so if i had bought asale item and they didn't have it andthe comparable item was something alittle more expensive or if the onlycomparable item was a larger larger sizethey would charge me for the originalsale price which is pretty cool and thiswas my first order so i got it for freethe five dollar was waived and she alsosaid that my second order would be freeto she gave me a promo code but justreally great service so far she wasexcellent I mean it

really good the chest is reallygood it's just a little awkward righthere go girl I like the shirt it's verysimilar to their new was it their newseamless t-shirt that they just came outwith like a

what's going on guys it's high comingback at you with another video and todayI want to give you a closer look at theJim shark fit tapered bottom to pointout the fit tapered bottom two-pointnose is made of a sixty percentpolyester 35 percent cotton and 5%spandex they featured two side pocketstwo rear pockets and a zipper around theankles to adjust 5 foot 5 and thenwearing and small in the black-and-whitecolorway here's her Coulson look at thecharcoal and white Hollowayalright guys so overall the 15 forbottom 2.0 are probably my favorite linerepair I'm Jim shark right now and theseare probably my favorite bottom is aperiod just because they're socomfortable they're stretchy and they'rereally form-fitting so if you do a lotof legs these are they're really gonnashow your gains off my only issue withthese kind of like with sweats ingeneral someone let us compose up a lotof cotton like this over time they'regonna fade and they're gonna lose theirvalue for sure if you have like ordinarysweats you know at the bottom or thecrotch it does that furry clump up thingwhere the material just collects after awhile and these after one wash arealready doing it so that's more of aproblem with what's to have a lot ofcotton in the in the composition and Ijust hope that Jim Chuck moves tosomething like a all polyester or a lotof polyester line of apparel just tokeep that from happening just becauselike if you have something like adidasor like Nike Training pants they're like100% polyester so no matter how manytimes you wash them or anything theyalways keep the black the black stayblack and the the material doesn't dothat copying up thing that's just moreof a cotton that's the problem withcotton but if you stick with somethinglike the grays and the charcoals that'snot really gonna be a problem that mightfade a little bit but nobody can reallytell it's more of the blacks and that'sjust unfortunate so like I said I hopeJim shark thinks about something likethat an all polyester line of appareloverall like I said these fit taperbottoms to where else for what they arethey're kind of the best if you'relooking for a good lightweight highquality pair of bottoms for the gym orfor looks they're really aesthetic toobut if you want something reallyhigh-quality I suggest you go with thefit tapered bottom 2.0 versus the gymtrack imprint bottoms and if you look atmy imprint bottom reviews you'll kind ofknow my opinions on them and that's thatlike I said highly recommended untilnext video don't forget to rate commentsubscribe catch you guys next time,22,UCunmiTJt8_KhkL6ps2iDaYA,Kate'sFitnessJournal,8,10,0,42,No Tags,"Покупки спортивной одежды: Nike, Gym Shark.

so i bought more gym sharkbut only because it was absolutelynecessaryand by necessary i mean they had somenew stuffand i just had to try it outwell hello welcome welcome back if thisisn't your first time i'm demi yourbrand new neighborhood fitness redand today we're going to be going oversome of the new gymshark purchases i'vemade we're going to start off with thehyper amplifier i have amplified onesare very similar to previous leggingsthe gymshark have done beforebut those were just called the amplifyseamless from like a couple years agonow i thinkand those were actually some of myfavorite legos i used to wear them allthe timebut this time when they brought themback they came back inshorts as well which if you've seen myother videos subtle plugyou know that right now i'm absolutelyloving shorts because i'm doing mostlyhome workoutsi'm going to start off with the blacknow whenever i buy shorteror any activator really i like to have aneutral option in there so i can wearthem with anythinghence why i picked these ones up theyhave a nice thick waistbandwhich doesn't have too much stretch init so it'sabout a medium to high compression i'dsay but the rest of the leggingis super stretchy so you shouldn't haveany problemswith fit the waistband has these lineswrite down it they look like ribbonmaterialand then at the side they go across so ithink that's just to givea little bit more shape so they've gotthese contour lines as well on the legof the shortsright here to help shape your quads andalso boom in the back these lines goright around your booty soenhance focus right these leggings are afive inch inseam which on mestop just above my thigh it means thatwhen i'm working out in them i don'thave to be worried about them rolling uptoo highthese ones are squat proof on meand i think the reason for that is whenyou look inside the shortsyou'll see that they've kind of doublelined themand you stretch them with squatting allyou will seeis that lining on the inside theythey show up better on the second colori got let me just show that to you rightawayso i got these ones which are light grayslash coralexactly the same as the black shark withthe linesin front and also in the backbut not because the contrast of this issuch a bright neon color you can seewhat i mean better when you turn theminside out you seeinside of the shorts is lined with thatsame colormaterial when you stretch them out in asquator whatever else all you're going to seeis that colorfrom the lining these are squat pro formethe other interesting thing about theseshorts are with the ones with theneon contrast they'll like they glowglow in the darkif you have any black light and you putthem on you'll be able to seethe neon coral from miles away same withthe neon line which i didn't get becauseit just didn't speak to me wheneveroutside opens up again and you go tothosespinning classes where they do them inthe dark with black light oneverybody will be able to see exactlywhere you are there's a great if youtype a person who likes going runningespeciallyin the morning no one is missing you inthese shortsnext we're going to move on to theventure collection i already picked upthe tops in this because none of thebottom isreally called out to me and i don't knowjust something aboutthem was off me so i just got topsthe first one i got is in this gorgeousdark green color it's a mock neck with azipper in the back making it easier toget over your heada long sleeve it has little slitsat the elbow i think that's just to giveyou a place to have a little bit moreair come init's got little slits at the side it's ahigh-lowkind of cut so it's shorter in the frontlonger in the back it's got this weirdintersection of likeworkwear slash active work so if youclock out at five it needs to be inclass by sixyour go-to next up we have a t-shirtthe reason i got this t-shirt isactually because of the printit's this new weird kind of take on camoit's supposed to be this is also a highlow cutbut it's shorter in the back and longerin the frontit stops literally right at where yourbooty startsif you're the kind of person who lostyour attention to the butt cheeksthis is for you these ones are midsleeve length so they stopjust above the elbow they're made ofthis really nice light cutting materialand if you look at it you see it's alittle bit see-throughso very breathable i'd say you'd be ableto doa full workout in it or even just a warmup and then take it offbut this is a good addition to thewardrobe for my girls who don't reallywant to work out and just a sports barmoving on fromthose big collections i also picked up acouple ofthings in the little restocks that theylike to dostarting with the legacy shorts ialready have themin the black which is actually what i'mwearing right nowwhen they first dropped i just got themin one color because i wasn't sure ifi'd like them and then they came in andi loved themand by then they completely sold out onthe website and it took them a couple ofmonths to read stuff but they finallydid so i picked it upin this color as well these are thesuper highlights they're so much morehighlighted than that hyper amplifiedonesi tend to just roll it up at the top soi have a bit more of my [ __ ] showingthey've got lines all of them as wellseamsthat i think is supposed to be forcontouring buti don't know they don't really do muchfor me either way i got these shortsmostly because i like the feel of themthey've got that nicesoft kind of brush material to themthese when stretched out about fourinch inseam shorts but they've got theselittle toggles at the side that you canpull upto make them shorter if that's a morecomfortablelength for you to work out in anotherthing i picked up from the larry stocksis a flex tag in a different color now iknow by now you're probably tired ofhearing me hammer on about the flex tankbut i do really just love them so i hadto go backand get in this pretty light grey colorexactly the same as i mentioned beforejust in a different color okay that's itfor today for methat's all the stuff i picked up ingymshark recentlyi'm thinking of going on a coupledifferent websitesand picking up a few more activatorpieces maybe alafili because they've gotafew things on there i want to try butwe'll see i'll put it up on the channelanyway if i end up getting itthank you so much for watching pleaselike share subscribewatch my other videos and come back formore fun stuffi got tons more planned okay

okay gopher buddy he was on therebeautiful people episode 149 of thepurpose Show podcast vlog today we aretalking about zero to hero one of theUK's finest in clothing who did someincredible stuff and it is an inspiringpositive story I am floored by it butfirst we talk ignite your purpose wetalk longevity through a healthylifestyle it is a mix of the mentalphysical and spiritual knowledge themind body soul trifecta and its baseday-by-day John and I are here toprovide negative to positive stories sothat we can push out to the ether thenpositive vibes John please read what youhad to say before because it was bang onand then let's chat about this younggentleman who is inspiring you and mewith his action and many around well doyou know dude I could read it if I canfind I read it here it is the gym shothustled zero to hero bent Francis fromhis parents carriage with a buddyto turning over 100 million pounds hellosix years now lots of people will haveseen Jim shot come out for nothingwhat's this new brand but it onlystarted six years ago with a young manhe was building apps in his bedroom hewas start a social fitness social medianetwork so dating network doing allsorts of stuff so what did it take and Ithink I heard himself he heard him saytoday always took creating what theyloves that they put the hours in theykept reinvest in the money into thebusiness taking educated risks on whatthey thought what would might work andhere's a little story about the amountof work this guy put into when hestarted he was at university doing hisdegree so he'd go to university for theday and finished that and then he'd gowould work delivering pizzas for PizzaHut from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. and then he'dgo home answering the email buildingwebsites for people designing growinghis own ideas asbrand to effectively create a betterlife for himself he wasn't limiting hisown beliefs based on where in thecountry he lived all the amount of moneyhe did or didn't have or even in thattime he's quite obvious that if you putin that amount of hours you know I'vegot a lot of time to spare so he wasfinding time between the hours of 10:00and the early hours of the morningto build this brand he was reallyinnovative about how he managed to getpeople on board and brands on board hejust sent her free clothing to peoplewithin the fitness and the fitness modeland body building areas of business andand they'd get it and they'd like itthen they turn up to the shows andpromote for him for free and effectivelyit's not exactly zero to hero but he'scome out of nowhere in six years throughsheer hard work determination belief andseeing a gap in the market you knowwe're in the 21st and century and youknow we all think that everything's beendesigned and everything's been createdbut he saw a gap in the market for cruelfitting sharp looking sports clothingfor the bodybuilding fitness model worldand he's taken off and the boys doingwell he's just don't the phq it's gotyou know hundred staff a couple hundredstaff and the boy is doing good max wesay it what can we learn from this youngman so let me take it back back becausewe talk positive in the shaman world inthe Native American traditions andtraditions of native tribes everywhereit is a well well well known fact thatwe have three brains they claim it gutbeing the biggest heart being the secondbiggest mind being the third being thesmallest and I have a feeling that mostof us in the Western world or these youknow industrialized countries I think wego opposite I think we think with thisfirst yeah you know what all resolvesjham jham be always herewell that can't be done I still here tothis day if you are not physically outthere working so whether you're mechanica construction guy a paramedic ahairdresser I don't care if you're notout there physically doing somethingpeople don't consider anything else notworking so with you and I John if we'resitting in that office hustling theydon't consider that work but there isjust another human being that has provenat a young age and hopefully had somesupport but I'm sure he put the blinderson and well and said screw this I'mgoing forward and you know what hedidn't he failed obviously a lot oftimes meaning some of those companies hestarted didn't work but he kept throughwith each vision and one of them John heinspired I'm so pop yeah honey he wasn'twith with the mindhe wasn't thinking the mind he wasthinking with the gut maybe the heartbut he was keeping it so down hererather than sort of all their airy-fairyyeah I'm inspired and motivated to keepgoing there and I was out with theclient this morning we mentioned his orher name well after this session wouldjust pop him back to his house and andthis is not egotistical he said John isthere anything that you don't excel atwell I don't think it I don't excel atlots of things but quite blown away thefact that he said this and I said wellI've not really given it and any amountof conscious thought about what it is oranything that I don't excel at and hesaid I believe then that you've notaimed high enough and big enough yetyou've still been keeping it small fryso it's reachable and acceptable anddoable and not 10x or 100x so that is athat's put another rocket on my ass tooif I can't earn extra max can't NXthat's 100x and we will keep putting thehours and putting the work and havingthe belief in the products that we arecreating we'll get there and we willcreate this platform to share andinspire and motivateacross the world I can't open the oldMacs I can't agree with you more on thatone John we see this whole time he isthrough our health as well even theMayan health it be the body healthy thephysical aspect and the mental spiritualaspect all in check all healthy so thatwe are able to continue to grind up thisout man and I think we're in a beautifulposition I think the people listeningare in a beautiful position I think thegentleman on your side of the world whoat wolfies 26 now and 20 years oldstarted you know do it and we so many ofus maybe not John tonight but the worldin general seems to you know onthese Millennials all the time look atthat just another perfect example ofsomebody who took the technologieseverything that's available at ourfingertips now for free and put that andmade a hundred million dollar companyWow congratulations sir you've impressedme and I am in spiral yeah and we thinkwe said this yesterday the biggesttragedy in the world is all this one whorealized potential there is so muchpotential and so much intelligence andyou know artistic flair and drive andbelief and we just need to have thatlittle bit of self confidence and thebelief that went that we can do it andto take that risk to fail and then tofail again to fail again and if we keepdoing this there is no loss we just keeplearning lessons and becoming bettereach and every day that's that's it forme I'm going to upset enough thanks forwatching thanks for listening if youlike

so i'm gonnatalk about the other ones i've gotoh okay okay so i've also got thisone that literally just found out thatthe bag has picked it up there's amirror there by the wayum if you don't know what

honey this is the second topsorry if my eyebrows look really messedup it's because i've literally beentrying topson and off for the past literally twohourshow's it taking me that long i actuallyneed to shut up basicallyright but this is the next owoh that was painful and we've not gotthe armpit issue can you see how there'slike room like my armpits hereand the clothes here you see in the gapthe gap very beneficialhowever listen they're sucking you inpretty little things and then they'resucking you in jesuschrist this band right okay my sportsbra ends herethis band not only is quite high up butit is reallyquite quite tight i can't lie but isuppose itdoes have the same benefits like youknow lift your arms up and thenyou know it's not going anywhere can yousee that it's making menot pop at the end you know what i meanlike do you know that ohit's a tricky situation to be in somaybei'd size up if you get this um but it isreally niceit's quite thick as well which is kindof a good thing i feel like or maybe itisn'ti feel like it's good when you're doingweights but maybe not so much whenyou're like runningall i can see is the fat poking out theside of me it's a really nice colourbut i have got fake tan on i feel likethat's important to know so i couldpotentially be looking really paleand i'm not going to be having a fullface of makeup on alsohmm so i'm not sure if i'd like this ijust think it's really really tight likehereand like it maybe you'll look nice likeif you're posing butmaybe not so much if you actually wantto go to the gym and go you can't docardio in thisi'm not i'm not a big fan i'm not as bigas a fan i'm notas as big a fan i'm not as big a fan i'mnot a speakervoice i'm not as big as a fan i'm not asa bigi'm not as big as a fan as i was withthe first one there we go there we gobut i feel like if you've got like areallyslim waist she got a slim waistwith a big bang what is it she got itshe got it she got a small waist smartoh you know what i'm on about um i wouldgive it honestly like a six out of tenoh but i don't know you know becauseit looks i'd rather wear this i feellike i'd be more comfortable wearingthisa lot going out then i would be wearingit to the gym but it's very versatile inthat sense so i guess it's kind of goodbut anyway right we're going to move onto the next one just size up and thenyou'll be saying to be fairbut yeah moving on i'm going to try onthis top herewhich i've just bent up which i think isexactly the same as this to be honestjust a different color maybeclearly i was a fan on the pretty littlething website they're really real medidn't they but anyway right this couldbe cute actually i thought this could bea vibei'm a fan of the color should you do thetransition where you like pretend to putit on then it's actually onshall we okay ready three two oneokay guys we lost the earring in theprocess oh my god the backthe back of the earring silhouetteit up right okay nevermind i was gonnasayso we're just gonna have to do the restof the video everyone earring it goahead and do the transition okayreversedid it work does that look good ithought that wouldn't have looked goodanyway right this is the next top i canconfirm it is literallythe exact same but just in a differentcolor soit's an addiction but like whatever ismine but yeah i feel like this is acuter color to be fairi don't know how to explain the materiali feel like i could jump in a swimmingpool and i'd be resistant i'd be waterresistant guys i really wouldbut i think what's that oh it's just ashadow i thought i've got lip gloss onit then i was gonna sayi feel like i would pay a good 12 poundfor this top maybebut then like i'm comparing it to normalpretty little thing prices likeif i need to compare this like gymprices like that half of the gin topsthat you buy sometimesare like 40 30 quid that are literallynot worth that 30 40 quid and i'mmoaning because i don't want to pay morethan 12 pounds for this top or 14whatever i said i rememberi feel like if i got this from likegymshark or like fabletics or likemy protein or whatever wherever you buyfancy gym clubs from i personally shopat primark soi couldn't tell you it is really goodquality i feel like maybe if you're notworried about like your fat poking atthe side then you'll literally be finelikei would one million percent get this topbut it's mei've got a problemo and i just reallydon't want fancy myfat being poked at the signage do yousee what i mean like can you see what imean like if i'mgoing down can you say she'll give you a360. hang onand like you wouldn't have to be fairyou wouldn't have like a switchback proswitch patch problemsjust like because of the gap so it's asticky oneit is good it is good maybe it's just memaybe got the wrong size but it's reallygood qualityso do with that with you well i'm reallysorry i've said to review jim close andi feel like i'm not doing a very goodjobbut moving on this one is purpleand i'm feeling it's got the same bandas the last onelike the and oh wow we like crosses overat the bottomthat's so cute i tell you what pltthey're good designers whoever'sdesigning prt gym wearwe used to do that all the time i cannever do it i'm gonna try this one oni'm gonna shut offthree two one i can't remember whichword we sold okay thisis cayute i am a fan i really like itthe label is silly but i will bechecking out soon because i like iti think obviously it's a bit short butsports bro i'll just go don't actuallyknow it doesn't okay here's my storyoh i'm really gonna expose my bellybutton like that that's how far it doneit goesbut it's really nice i really like thisone i think i like the color or maybe ilike the combo with the pink as wellsorry i keep thinking there's peoplecoming into my house so i'm actually notlooking at myself in the mirror at thispoint i'm actually looking out thewindowso where yeah um hexagon do you knowthat sometimes when you put a can i getmy words outlike when you can see your sports brawhen you normally put like a gym topnot normally but sometimes when you putit on you can see your sports bra youcan't see the sport surprised what i'mtrying to sayyou know getting so distracted as wesaid again like when you lift your armsupyou're good you're not going anywherebecause of the band likei don't know who introduced this bandand who thought it'd be a good idea butwhoever it isdeserves a raise the band is still quiteyou know tough but like one it's gonnastretch and two because it's over thesports bra because it's shorteri think it's making it a bit less do youknow what i mean like it's a little bitlesssucking me in making me look like abeach whale yeah two more to goand then we are done my guysso i'll be back what transition can wedo next shall i dab into it threetwo one guysuh we've got yet another one of exactlythe same top i'm pretty surebut like why did i feel that i need toget it in this color and this colorwhere is the need emily really i thoughti would really like itoh this is a bit embarrassing isn't ituh but to be faira big fan kind of not really not a bigfan actually i don't know i just saidthat and why those words just came outof my mouth because i'm not a big fani really think i'm just like onthis for no reason whatsoever isactually a really nicegym top i think i need to stop moaningdon't ibe honest i do anyway right so but yeahthere's not reallynot much to say about it i think this isa nicer color over there shall i seewhat color this is actuallydusky blue sculpt dusky blue dusky bluedusky blue is better he's a bettercolourimo in my opinion than just blueso dusky blue i'd go for dusky blue overthis blueyou know unless you want to be matchingwith youryou know leggings which may be this kindof blue who knows we've got one moreleft and then we're done i feel likethis is gonna be a really quick videobut also may not be because i've beenchatting throughoutso what transition should we do i'm notgoing to do the one way you like go downand then come back up because you cansee me in the mirror and that will behardly embarrassingbecause i did it before it wasn't funnyediting back because there was nothing icould do about it because i'd committedand like those literally just nothingelse i could do anyway right so i'mgoing towhat can i do what transition can i dooh this one okay you ready three twoone ladies and gentlemen may ipresent to you the final gym topi like it we ended on a good note guyswe've only done a good noteit looks exactly like the purple one butlike this one's likea grainy if you know what i mean it'scuteright and i feel like this would be easyto match with scrunchies do you knowwhat i mean like i've got literallygot a gray scrunchie here and like ifyou i feel like if you put this in yourhairoh my god you just look like you'vereally got your life togetherbut i feel like the same issue would beyou'd be having the same issuewith this as you would with the one thati wore at the beginning which was thatthe sweat patcheswill be visible you just got to rock itwith confidence like just think oh wellyeah i've got patches because i'mworking out so muchdon't mind me what are these what's theword what's thatwhat's the what's the pickup line thatwas embarrassing it's got the crossoverthing at the bottom againi will obviously as i said put theprices onthe bottom of the screen and i'll linkthem all down below sodon't worry about that sweetheart it'sthat splashokay but what i wanted to do finallyjust to end it offis to speak about some of my favoriteleggingsand some of my favorite cheap places togo for gym wear because i feel like as isaid earlier like sometimes youliterallypay 40 million pounds for clothes thataren't worth the money but one primarklistendon't knock it until you try it you canget some really bad things from therei'm not gonna lie i have been a victimof that myselfbuying extremely poor quality thingsfrom primarkand then not wearing them because likethe leggings the full day and you knowit's just not a vibebut these some of these i'm glad theseare some of my favorite leggings i'll goand get them at my wardrobethese are the leggings right and they'reliterally playing back leggingsthey've got a zip on like keep an eyeout for these because these are goodthey've got a zip on the back but lookcan you see like it is fake adidas butlike it's not that obvious becausethe black but you can get them in whiteas well but they haveto be specific six stripes stay on theside when they've gotavoid the ones that have the big waistbands on because when they've got thebig waistbands on believe it or not it'svery ironic because they're bigthey don't hold they don't stay up likethey really just don't but likethese are like kind of a waterproofmaterial so like i feel like you'll knowwhat i'm on about if you went to primarkand then like literally all the sportsbras they're not gonna be the bestthings in the world but they're decentjustmaybe get like a size smaller than youlike your actual size because thenthey're more likeyou know i mean which you know byfableticslisten i did slug off fabletics beforebecause well what they used to do wasyou have to pay for a membership andthen get the two for 24 pound leggingsand then you have to carryon paying for the membership for likethe next six months like you couldchoose to skip the month but then if youforgot to skip the month like betweenlike the first and the fourth of thebeginning of every monththen you'd get charged like 50 quid andit was like it was a bit of a joke nowwhat you can dois get the leggings with the membershipand then cancel the membership straightafteri've done that and i've got two pairs ofleggings and when i'm not joking youlikethey're really good leggings like theyare really really good leggings and theyalways have like pocketssomewhere on the leggings like they'llalways have them somewhere they'rehonestlythe best leggings ever and but yesthat is i'm trying to think of someother places that i've been to i boughtgym where from but i don't really thinkthere is anywhere else to be honestprimal fableticspretty little thing i haven't tried myscar i did maybe i'll try it next thoughlet me know in the comments down belowi'm joking i mean you can do if youalright i just wanted to see you know uphere if you are actually looking forgym my stuff and if not then i hope youenjoy the video anywaybut yeah that is the end of the videoi'm gonna shut up now because i feellike i've actually been trained all dayi hope you enjoy the rest of your

hi everybody my name is Anastasia andwelcome to my channel today I'll bedoing the most requested video of hadlately is leggings reviews I've done afew of them in the past I'll link themunderneath as well as a couple offitness videos of questions you askedthe most like car with ABS and what Ieat so I'll put also the link for my ABSand what I eat in a day example alsobefore I start I just want to say thatnone of these leggings were sent to meas a gift or anything like that I boughteverything myself and I'll be returninga few of them you will see so as alwaysmy opinion is completely transparent andhonest and as always I'll put all thelinks underneath so let's jump into itfirst up a beautiful blue leggings byadidas or adidas however you pronounceit I thought they're gorgeous when I sawthem on the picture I love the parrottrying to put the coin different but tomy disappointment and I think this isquite obvious one because when you orderleggings you never know what materialwould really be like and I didn't expectit to be super cottony you know whatthey remind me of they're kind of thesame cotton material of leggings you getfrom H&M so even though they're quitecomfortable they're breathable problemwith them is that they are cotton Ewhich means that if you do get sweatydepending on whatever exercise you doyou will definitely get a sweat thateven though they're dark basically whatI've done is just put a bit of water onthe bottom of the leggings and itdefinitely shows darker so I think maybeit's good for like just walking aroundor doing a bit of yoga where you don'tsweat at all but it's definitely not forproper gym or proper running or properanything that you're really working outthere more like kind of bless yourleggings I would say I'll definitely bereturning them blue Nike leggings as youcan see I went crazy for the blue thistime and I really like them they'regreat but they actually have the sameissue I have with Adidas leggings that Ishowed you earlier is that they madefrom this cotton material and it wasquite misleading as I got it on ASIS andit looks quite shiny and stretchy and Ireally did not expect them to be ascottony as theyotherwise the great ladies for the sameactivities as the blue adidas ones sofor walking maybe a bit of yoga here andthere but again nothing too crazynothing too sweaty because the materialwill show any bad patches probably agreat option to wear around casuallylike going to grocery store or takingyour dog out for a walk another pair ofgorgeous cobalt blue leggings which Iabsolutely love it because I thoughtthey're kind of perfect in the way ofdesign and also the price they were only20 pounds from Asus and I've never heardabout this brand before so I was like ohmy god yes something new to try and tobe honest it was great really love thequality they were a bit on a small sideI also small again but they kind of felta bit tighter in terms of the fabricfabric was not as stretchy and also themain problem I had with them is thatthey're not super high-rise like I likefor example for me somebody who isprobably also curvy the bottom area itdoesn't cover my whole bomb and thenit's great when you stand up butwhenever you're sitting down and doing asquat or anything like that it canliterally show a bit of your bum crackwhich is not ideal so if you're probablysmaller in the bottom area it will workreally well but if you're like me and ifyou like more high waisted leggings thenI would probably not recommend them nextup our lips leggings this thing isactually really great but one problem Ifound is that they're very wide on theway so what I had to do which looksactually really weird right nowis cut a side thing and see is basicallyI just pulled out an elastic and tied itinto a little knot so that it's reallykind of fits around my waist but they'rereally good a little bit sheer butbecause this is a size large they're notextremely tied with me as you can seeand they're quite good for all thingsactive I would probably necessarilysquat like crazy in them because againthey're a little bit here but otherwisethey're really good they're comfortableand they also don't cut your bloodstream a lot of leggings I findespecially compression ones like Nikeeven though they look great they're notsheer they really kind of tighten yourlegs up and these - if you have any veinproblems in your legs I don't know somepeople say it's good but I don'tnecessarily feel comfortable plussometimes when you get water retentionor youfeel extra puffy that they actually getmarks from the ladies when you take themoff so these leggings are great for thatdefinitely comfortable loose fit likehe's from armature this is quite newbrand based in the UK they're quitecheap so I didn't really have highexpectations of them I thought Oh mightas well try them because they look kindof cool and what I love about them isthe fit that they're very high waistedso I love when it's all tied in and youfeel comfortable and flattering andthey're long and also these are quitelight materials so I think they're greatfor the summer because they are not likesuper heavy or thick and they are alittle bit sheer as you can see but thegood thing about them as I mentioned inmy previous reviews is that because youhave a pattern in this case a graythingy whatever it doesn't really showthe underwear so when you do choose infabrics make sure you choose print orpattern but don't choose like a plaincolor like black will definitely be seethe quality is not perfect like you cansee already some bits that are bitdamaged but to be honest like if youjust want a good workout leggings tolast you a couple of months they will dothe jobnext up are leggings by Kea dance Ireviewed them in the first review Ithink I've done and again I got them andTK Maxx did not get them on officialwebsite so I go to my second Mac's inLondon and basically like an outlet sodefinitely good value they were like 50%off and what I love is actually qualityI was super impressed with the qualityknow you have this logo on the back thenif you can see it's a bit reflective youhave a zip pocket for anything you wantto float like earrings like that andalso I love this style I thought thedesign is great because you have backmesh so the back of the legs iscompletely matched so you can see theskin but then the front is like a thickblack fabric and I think the whole shapekind of looks like you're wearing shortsbut you're not and I think it reallyexaggerated syou're front muscles and Ithink it's just super flattering they'requite high waisted as well and I gotthem in size small so they're a bit onthe tight side probably I will go for amedium if they had one they're stillsuper comfortable like I love the fabricI think it's definitely becoming one ofmy favorite brands because so far Inever go disappointed by their legsand yeah big thumbs up for this brandJim shark oh my god I was definitely themost excited when I was ordering theseleggings I was so excited I couldn'tsleep was like oh my god finally I'mgoing to get this amazing leg is thatall the fitness models are wearing butoh my god I was disappointed they're sosheer you can see I mean it's reallyreally one of the most Shear leggingsI've ever experienced in my life alsothey're quite long so I got sofrustrated and upset and I was thinkinglike oh my god this is something wrongwith my body because obviously the way Ifit them is so sheer and how do allthese models wear them and when I wenton Twitter and typed Jim shark leggingsor Instagram the same hashtag I foundthat all the girls are basically sayingthe same thing that the black style thatI'm showing you right now it's extremelysheer and then Jim shark made alsoofficial kind of notice is saying allthese leggings actually meant only forrunning they're not for GM escorting andfor Juman squatting they recommend thegray version which I haven't triedbefore so I cannot say for that leggingsbut it's quite frustrating I think oncethe big part is because the fabric ofJim shark leggings is incredible it isthe softest nicest fabric so I don'tknow if there's any way they can makethem thicker it would be like a dreamcome true but also I really love thatthey're high-waisted and they have thislittle silicone strap on top inside theelastic so basically it kind of letsthem sit on your waist and not movearound which I thought was amazing so ifyou don't look at the Sheerness in termsof shape and the fit and it just I lovethem the most to be honest so far everever and for walking around it's okaybut honestly even if you're running andyou're tying up your shoelaces you willdefinitely be able to see your underwearno matter what underwear you wear sodefinitely and no but I decided to keepthem anyway because I love the fit ofthe sand and the solution I found iswear black tights underneath so you candefinitely see nothing and of course itmeans that you could not do anythingsweaty on proper hardcore with theseleggings but at least they're not sheerand if you just want to go for like amorning walk or when it's a colder dayyou can definitely look great in theleggings with tights underneath theseare mainleggings were the nicest material everbut unfortunately they did not work forme neitherand the reason here which is quiteunique situation they were high-risethey were amazing fabric don't share Ilove the little arrows on the side forthis very flattering ankle wasn't tightbut the problem with them is that theywere very loose in the waist area is itnot the top elastic was great the bottomwas great but the middle patch as youcan see there was some extra fabricgoing on and I'm not sure maybe becausethe sizing is a bit funny so this sizeis basically small / medium and theother size the head is medium / large sothey didn't have any smaller option orstrictly size small Austrian size mediumtherefore I think they kind of fit formore different body types and again ifyou're like me you have a bigger ratiobetween bottom and your waistI wouldn't recommend the leggings but ifyou do have wider waist I think it's anamazing option because again they don'tdig in your body is a really comfortablegreat fabric and they're high-waistedbut I'm definitely putting this brand onmy radar and hopefully I can find it onthe option next time with better fitaround the waist area and last but notleast the tank stuff I'm wearing rightnow it's actually my friend launched hisbrand called lift nice just lift I thinkit's very cool concept about all thefitness people out here and this tanktop is unisex this was a gift for me andalso I'm on the web site as a femalemodel which I'm not so it's definitelygreat sign up I would recommend it ithas like a bit of a vintage feel to itso it's not like super bright color butI think it works great and thismulticolored so it works for any type ofoutfit I love it and I think it comeslike small medium and large so this issize small and it's great for thinkanybody between size 8 and 12 for girlsand for boys I think if you have bigarms but smaller torso it would work andotherwise there's also medium and largeand I will also link it underneath asalways thank you so much for watching Ihope you enjoyed this review and haveanother one coming up in two weeksexactly so stay tuned for that have abeautiful daykeep fit andI will speak to you soon

"hey what's up guys I'm Scott frommuscular strength calm and today's videoI want to talk to you guys about Kinobodies natty verified movement and thereason why we're talking about this isbecause you guys have been commenting onmy recent videos hey Scott what do youthink about natty verified is it a goodidea is it a bad idea will it work whatdo you think and so we did some researchI watched Greg's video on the topic Ialso watched old last video if you guysI'm sure a lot of you already saw hisvideo has like 200,000 views orsomething like that so basically to someof Omar's video I agree with 99% if nota hundred percent of all the things thathe was saying so you're probably gonnahear a little bit of overlap here butthere are some other things that I wantto talk about that he didn't mentionwhere I'm pretty sure he would agreewith me as well and on the side no oh amI supposed to begin his ass down here toFlorida real soon we talked about thislast year when I was homeless living inmy I wasn't even in my house yet aboutdoing a collab so if you guys want tosee that comment down below and I'lltext Omar and say hey get your Canadianass to Orlando let's go ride the newHarry Potter ride and film some epiccollabs yeah anyways why we care aboutnanny verified like who really cares atthe end of the day let me be very clearwith all of you I do not care whosenatural and who's not natural all I careabout at the end of the day is that theinformation being provided to you beingsold to you and that you're findingonline is actually going to work andhelp you reach your goals whether you'rea hundred percent lifetime natural ornot it doesn't matter either one ofthese people can have the informationyou need to reach your goalsunfortunately the problem now and thereason why natty verified is becomingsuch a big deal and such a big topic isbecause you have a lot of people thatare trying to get YouTube and instantI'm famous that are jumping on lowdosages of gear to look basically mysize a little bit bigger and a littlemore shredded to sell their garbageworkout programs and I think it'sgetting to the point now where you guysare really sad to stuff up I mean yougot people making frigging I'm workoutvideos telling you that triceps pushdowns are our compound movement this isa V Bob and it is used to do a tricepspush down in this for the truss a pushdown now we're doing this as a firstmain compound movement and that's howyou're gonna build huge opslike I don't think you guys understandwhat it well I mean those of you who arelifetime Naturals understand and ifyou're watching this and if you've beentraining for a long time you understandbut if you're new to fitness and youjust you just started going to the gymnow I don't think you quite understandwhy people like myself and Oman gets soirritated with these fig Natty's cominginto our coming into our space andclaiming lifetime natural to sell youtheir their friggin garbage workoutprograms and meal plan advice ah as anatural lifter okay I've been liftingsince I was 12 I said up working in agym when I was 14 at that age I'm 34years old now at that young age YouTubedidn't exist how did I make any gains asa kid I listened to all the jimbros thatwere in my gym would see advice goodlet's just say you know what there's awill there's a way when you're that ageand you're excited about lifting you'regonna spend three or four hours at atime in the gym you're gonna get resultsand we've talked about this there's athing that's called newbie gains okaywhen you first start exercising in yourfirst year you can gain anywhere between20 to 25 pounds of muscle and that'swhat even if you're doing an absolutejust like horrible program as long asyou are creating some sort ofstimulation to the muscle tissue andeatingmore food you will see games and that'sa false positive for a lot of the[ __ ] that these fake naturals sellto all of you because you check outtheir six-month transformation photoswhen they basically go from looking likeSteve Urkel to friggin Phil Heath rightand you're like wow lifetime that's realray in the in the profile like Simonepanda this dudes a lifetime natural he'sas big as Arnold he must know what he'stalking about right like this is no waythat somebody would lie to me on socialmedia to sell [ __ ] right the way thatwould ever happen like who would eventhink that I could I could lie and maketons of money like who could ever thinkthat would happen and then what happensyou buy the program you start eatingcorrectly you make your newbie gains butthen you quickly plateau because youdon't really know what you're doing andthe person that sold you that programdoes not really know what it takes tobuild muscle naturally you can be on lowdosages of gear and go to the gym and dotricep press downs and think it's anamazing exercise for your tricepsbecause you're getting a pump and seeingmuscle growth but if you're a hundredpercent natural athlete you go to thegym and you do that as your firstexercise and then you move on you're notgonna see growth past those initialnewbie games it's just not an exercisethat's meant to build big triceps it'san exercise that's meant to helpincrease the overall mind muscleconnection to your triceps and maybework as a burn out at the end of yourworkout because we learned things likecompound movements and try toincorporate them into our programs asmuch as possible one of the biggeststruggles for me you know being young isI was very ignorant as a kid you know Ihad no idea why a lot of my friendsespecially on the football team when Iwas like 15 16 years old I'm like barelyI was really skinny guys like I was likea hundred and thirty-five pounds orwhatever I wasn't super strong I wasbarely benching 95 pounds andtraining all the time and I had friendscoming in the gym on the football teambenching you know 135 for rats 225 forreps and I just could not understand howsomebody who's not even training as hotas I am like I worked in a freakin gymat that point how somebody who'straining is hot or not training as hotas me is making so much more progressionuntil I got older I realized that 99% ofthe kids on my football team or on gearlike and I'm not even making that up oneof the kids on the team actually had theFBI I had no I actually just learned astory recently I'm not gonna say hisnames I want to get in trouble but it'skid I with the high school whiff wasselling gear to everybody else on thehigh school football team his house gotraided by the police I think the FBI andthey found his little black book ofeveryone's name phone number and hisstuff he was selling and then he endedup selling out the the people who weregiving him all the stuff that he wasselling to the football team and within24 hours he liked he liked moving acrossthe country I was like where did thiskid go I haven't seen him in a while I'dbe like oh he moved he's out of herecrazy like crazy but like it's the pointof that story is some of you might bewatching this video and be very ignorantto the fact that it is a lot easier thanyou think to get ahold of these illegalsubstances and if you're listening topeople that are giving you informationbased on being on illegal substances andthat never they've never known what it'slike to to suffer through a plateau tohave to redo your entire workout becausecertain exercise is not working orcertain exercises are wasting your timethere's a lot of knowledge that youobtain from trying and failing and thatgoes a long way and with you guys beingso lucky to be able to go on YouTube andhave this wealth of informationavailable to you and not have to gothrough these these periods of sufferingand having to redo your workouts becauselike I said when I was a kid that stuffdidn't exist so it was all trial anderror for you guys it's mostly trial andsucceed and then trial and succeed moreright if you follow in the right peopleso that's a big pot of it for me andanother thing is I made a video aboutthis it's called one cycle of steroidequals bigger forever the biggestdifference between a natural athlete anda lifetime natural athlete even if youdo just one cycle you are modifyingyourselves okay you bit at theepigenetic level or the epigeneticmodifications that are happening in yourskeletal muscle tissue I hope I saidthat correctly it's been a while since Imade this video but there are EFI topicAsians that basically unlock unnaturalpotential and your skeletal muscletissue which basically means in simplestterms that as soon as you do one cycleyou're modifying the cells in your bodyto be able to grow more muscles so thateven when you go off let's say you doone cycle and never do it againyou have still unlocked more musclebuilding potential that otherwise wouldhave never been available to you as they100% natural athlete and that's why alot of dudes that do one cycle and ifthey do it at the right time and duringthe time where they're growing the mostand they eat tons of food and they bulka lot yeah they might shrink down alittle bit but the amount that theyshrink down versus how much they wouldhave grown if they see it a hundredpercent natural they start here and theyreach a point of here by jumping on acycle right now this is the psychoperson this is the natural person theymight shrink to like there and then thenatural limit might be like here sothere's still a gap in between what theywould have accomplished as ahundred-percent natural athlete versusdoing one cycle and it is very importantthat you guys understand that and thenwhen we apply this to the naturallyverified movement and this is the thingthat Ouma didn't really touch upon inhis video he talked about a lot abouthow if youno the test is coming there's ways toget around it and pass it I mean thatshould be common knowledge by now thatthere's ways to get around these testsmy biggest beef with naturally verifiedis you can be off here for ten years butbecause you still did it and you got alot of muscle growth out of it you canstill try to sell this image and takethis test get naturally verified and sayhey look I took the test I'm naturallyverified I look amazing you all want tolook like me here's my program spendyour money and don't get me wrong theprogram that they're selling could stillbe a good program like I'm not sayingthat if you're not a hundred percentnatural don't know what you're talkingabout but you will never look like themand with Fitness basically you know wehave just like just diseases like bodydysmorphia for some of you you get thisprogram you see that this person isnaturally verified and you train as hotas you possibly can but you can neverget your shoulders to look cat-likethere's deal and you can never get asveiny as they are and you can never getto that level of leanness that they haveand you can't understand why becauseyou're doing their program and theirnaturally verified and then you justhave to think things like oh maybe Ihave bad genetics so that's why I can'tdo it and we stopped making up all theseexcuses their genetics are better thanmine or my genetics are really bad thenwe make every excuse instead of justcoming to the conclusion that you'rebeing lied to and that is my problem ifyou are in fitness and you're on socialmedia and you're on YouTube and you'repeddling your programs that's fine andthere's a lot of people in this industrythat compete at a very high level wherethey probably I on some type of gear andI don't think it's fair to go on a witchhunt and go after these people becausethat's a part of the industry and thismight sound a little bit beingcontradictory to you guys that I'msaying this but if you think about it atthe end of the day thisa verified thing okay it's more for thepeople that are claiming a hundredpercent natural and you look at themyou're like okay bro like take take iteasy right these are the people we wantto go after we're not going after mr.Olympia to like have a witch hunt like Imean I think that's a little ridiculousif you ask me so I don't want to talktoo much about this topic I pretty muchsaid everything I want to say but I wantto hear more from you guys I want toknow down in that comment section whatyou think do you agree what I'm sayingdo you disagree what I'm saying do youthink that there's other tests that canbe administered do you want to see mewith like a back pack of syringes andand mouth swabs and just jump in peopleas they're coming out of the gym I meanlike hey I have a test I want you totake it if you don't take it you're notnatural actually I would like to seethat that would be hilarious can youimagine like like a like a TMZ type youknow situation or like paparazzi's typesituation for just like jumping out oflike the friggin bushes or from behindthe counter out of gym and I'm just likeboom in your face would have cared weretoo light and I'm like take my test oryour or you're not natural that would behilarious I would probably do it with mybro Lee wig on too just to make evenmore fun but anyways let me know whatyou guys think down in the commentsection belowat the end of the day people like myselfpeople like oh my and from what I cansee obviously people like Greg our mainconcern is to make sure that theinformation being provided to all of youis factual and will work it's not somuch for me about going on a witch huntto see who's nati who's not it's justthat there's too many people now takingadvantage of YouTube and other socialmedia who aren't natural and are giving[ __ ] advice and those people definitelyneed to be called out on their [ __ ]so hope you guys enjoyed the video besure to smash that like button andnext

now I'll be honest with ya I didn'tthink I was gonna be back here so soonyou know definitely not for the rest of2017 but then Jim shark said surpriseNew Year's Day we're releasing theentire new energy seamless set and aspromised I promised you an entire reviewvideo collection like 300 times duringwhat myselfhere we are ending 2017 with a bang andthen start in 2018 with an even biggerbang because these clothings wellthey're bigger I'm gonna be covering itall today so I hope you guys enjoy thisvideo if you do please be sure to givethis video a thumbs up and never forgetto subscribe so you never miss a fit tipwith wit again I haven't said that in areally long time because of wit miss sothat was excitingif you follow me on Instagram you knowhow much I've been loving these newseamless sets there's some pros there'ssome cons we're gonna go over all todaythere are four items in the energycollection that are releasing on January1st and I will list all of the timeshere for you I know the time zones couldbe confusing because Jim shark is a UKbrand so I have to use Google and I willGoogle them all and place them here foryou Jim sharks done a great job ofhyping up the seamless collection youknow they know what they're doing whichmeans this collection is probablyunfortunately it's gonna sell out and Iknow a lot of you are gonna be angry andyou're gonna be sad and I just want youto know that I am here for you you guyslet me know it's frustrating and Iunderstand so here's what you got to doat the time of the launch have thewebsite pulled up if you would like touse my commission link to purchaseanything from Jim shark I would HIGHLYappreciate it Navy would appreciate itwe love you thank you for supporting usand this channel so get my link loadedin your browser right at the time thatthe clock strikes zero when it launchesrefresh it get your stuff get in get outboom you got your seamless collectionlet's get into the material the materialis made out of a sixty nine percentnylon seventeen percent polyester14% elastane I'm telling you now thisnew collection is a very very highcompression collection okaygetting into the outfit itself is youris your warmup you get in this outfityou're warmed up you're ready to go workoutskip the Stairmaster that day you justwarmed up putting this outfit on I'msuper excited that they've switched tomore of a compression feel rather thanlike a lounge where you know a newseamless is completely flat so there'sno moral in it which usually means it'sa bit softer and more stretchy so withthis one it's not as stretchy it's alittle bit tougher but not anythingthicker than the previous release theband is double up so you're gonna havesuper super high compression and tummycontrol in the tummy region which I needso even though these may be verydifficult to get on once they're on theyfit perfectly they fit like a glove theyfit like a dream I will say one of thenegatives right away is that becausethey are super high compression thiscollection it kind of smushes the buttjust a little bit they've added thisamazing eyelet lacy detailing on thequad which just makes the quad just popwhich it also has it on the ankle aswell I have to tell you now they havegotten rid of the booty contour this isa controversial topic the booty contourdid I enjoy it yes thoroughly it reallycontoured my glutes some people hated itthey said it looks like sweat sweat onthe bum now there is just a little bitof ventilation in that same area butit's pretty much non-existentso that's just about everything you needto know about the material the materialof these feels very very high-end thisis something I'm very sensitive ofbecause the last thing that I ever wantis to show my butt to the world in thegym I'm here to tell you that theseleggings are squat proof I think somepeople get confused with skin averseelasticity almost all leggings haveelasticity in them if they're for thegym and when you squat sometimes it canbe a little bit shiny it's not your skinit'selasticity so I will say that on some ofthese when I squat I'm like yo is thatmy skin or sup the elasticity and it'sthe elasticity at the very very veryvery very very very bottom of a squat Iwould say can maybe see just a hint of ashadow for someone who's veryself-conscious of squatting andsee-through leggings I squat kneesI love these the black blew me awaybecause we all know that the blackmorrow in the last collection was likealarming Lisi threw these guyscompletely 100% squat proof now let'stalk about the lilac leggings becausethis is something I feel some girls areskimming over like it's no big deal solet's talk about the elephant in theirroom this is the elephant when I firstopen these and saw this built-inseamless underwear I thoroughly 100%thought it was a mistake so the purposeof the built-in seamless underwear is tomake these leggings completely nonsee-through now maybe I'm shockedbecause I don't wear underwear when Iworkout you guys all know that if youthink that's nasty I'm just saving theenvironment you're gonna wash yourunderwear and your workout pants why nottake one of those out of the equationless layers less lines it's my thingwhen I got mine thinking they were ajoke I just cut them out so in my sizesmall I cut it out immediately notknowing that that's how it was supposedto be I don't have a problem withsquatting in these without the built-inunderwear so I wanted to let you knowabout it because I didn't want you toget these in the mail so excited boutthe lilac color and then we're superdisappointed about the built in seamlessunderwear I showed these to Sydney andshe said this was something she wouldwant to know before purchasing all theother dream chart girls I see them inthem all the time it's no big deal tothem it's no big deal to me but it issomething I really wanted to let youknow it is seamless so the lines areminimal I know Nicki posted a legworkout wearing these and I couldn't seethe lines at all not a deal-breaker forsome people maybe deal-breaker forothers I did want to let you know cuzwhen I got these in the mail I was likefasting is difficult when you can't trythings on so I'm gonna do my best toexplain to you how I feel a sizing runsRobin mentioned she thinks because theyare such high compression that they runabout half a size smalland I would totally 100% agree with thatso when in doubt I would size up if youwere in between an extra small to smallgo with the small if you're in between asmall and medium go with the mediumbecause these are very high compressionthey are difficult to put on but like Isaid once you have them on they form andthey fit perfectly to your physique Idon't know what it is about black andJim shark but the black always seems torun a little bit tighter than the othercolors always the black is a bit tighterI still stayed with a size small I'm asize small in all of the leggings hereso for myself and the previous seamlessI wear size small and it was a littlebit looser on the waistband and then Istayed with a small here and thewaistband fits perfectly you know let'stalk about the energy bra I absolutelylove this bra I thought nothing couldbeat the cross-back bra with theprevious seamless I was wrong becausenow we have the energy seamless thisbrought to me is very supportive Iworkout in it I jump in it I do my hitin it I run in it I absolutely love thisbra they added this awesome ribbeddetailing on the bottom the eyelet lacynonsense on the side and in the backthey called this the waterfall straps inthe back and is so beautifulit's so flattering they did fix the padson this compared to the cross back brathis is what the previous pads lookedlike and sometimes it would show thepads on the bra this is what the newpads look like so they fix that issuewhere you know you're not gonna see likethe pad outline which kind of drives mecrazy sometimes so that's an awesome fixone drawback to these pads is becausethey are bigger they can pop out alittle bit on the detailing on the sidesthis can easily be fixed by just pushingthe pads in and then they won't stickout on the sides last thing I want totalk about is the crop vest I am superexcited about this because I think it isperfect for girls with much larger thisarea that need more support has thebuilt in bra with the pads a little bitdifferent straps in the back I thinkit's super cute perfect for girls withbigger girls perfect girls for littlergirls that want to feel a little bitmorehonest and covered in the gym and youdon't want to just be out there in asports bra alright guys that is going towrap up this video I did want to mentionsomething that Jim shark has donerecently which is awesome as they nowoffer free returns for US and Canada Ihope that this video helps you a littlebit when shopping tomorrow on New Year'sDayI will leave my Jim shark link below inthe description box so you can pop thatup have it ready get to shopping and goin have a great New Year's Day I loveyou guys stay safe be kind to love youNavy and I may be he's tired today anduntil next time I will see you next yearlove ya,22,UCQ20SRF5XAFyRBZbgFp8DoQ,Sylvia,2,5,0,22,No Tags,這是啥設計？！ Gymshark

[Music]hello wonderful humans and welcome backto the lesbian today's video issponsored byjim shark i know so when jim shark firstreached out to mei was like thank you for thinking i'm afitness influencer but i think you'vegot the wrong personi think it was two videos ago that yousaw that my fitness routine these daysis dancing to ice cream by black pink onjust dance in my roomand they were like no no hold yourhorses we're doing a habits challengeand we want you to be a part of it andthen i was like oh habitsthen i am who you're looking for sogymshark 66 is a series of nine weeklong challenges that go way beyondfitnessthe one i'm participating in startstoday and ends on the 25th and it'scalledmindfulness 66. when they let me pickout some items i had to really holdmyself back to not just choose eightdifferent hoodiesbut i did get two hoodies so i got thisgreen one and this beige one which hasthose coolholes for your thumbs i also got somematching joggersleggings sports bra zip up red jackettraining shorts and this cute littlepuffer coathow did i make it fly into my hand likethat i bet you have no ideaso something i've been struggling withis every week or every two weeks i'llget super tired and just crashand then i'll be like why did thathappen and then i look back at myjournal my mood tracking whatever and ican clearly see that i was gettingprogressively more tiredbut i wasn't doing anything about it andthen i just ended up crashing because ofthat so this week i want to work on thatand be mindful of havingwork and rest and play in each day but idon't want to go it alone so i got youpeopleinvolved in the process i posted thesepolls on my instagram stories for you tobasicallydesign my self-care week for me so let'ssee what you've decided for my fatei was really hoping for some landslidewins but a lot of them were almost50 so a lot of you are gonna bedisappointed by this video i guessokay so today is tuesday we are startingtoday because monday was a little bitcrazy i got a lot done so that's goodtoday you picked for me to read a bookand then i posted a second question andi asked which bookthis is not what books look like youvoted coffee over bubble tea by slimmargin soi'm a little upset with you guys forthat but that's okay wait i just drew abubble tea because my mind was thinkingbubble teawell it'll just be a coffee that happensto have a strawright in the middle of it i'm gonna goto lush and i askedbath bomb or bath bar and you guys votedbath bombbut one person who worked at lushactually said that bath bars are a lotbetter sounfortunately though i have to go withwhat the people voted fori'm gonna get myself some flowersand i think that's it for tuesdaywhy is it always 50 50. it's literally53.47and not in the direction that i wantedit to be honestly i've been a littledisappointed by your guys's choices sofar butthat's okay this is actually really goodi should trust you guys moremy social skills have obviously suffereda lot over the course of the past yearbecause i wanted to order two of thesedrinks plus two donuts becausein the valentine's day promotion it saysthat each drink pairs with a donut so iwanted the full experienceand then i also wanted to get one for myfriend because she's stressed out aboutschool so i thought i would likedeliver a little care package to herwell instead of two drinks and twodonuts i somehow miscommunicated and gotjust one drink soi finished saying my order and then theguy was like that'll be 505 at thewindow and i said okay thank you andthen suddenly i realizedthat's not enough for two drinks and twodonuts but it was too late and there areno other dunkin donuts locations nearbyi'm too embarrassed to show my facethere a second time sojust gonna drink my drink and deal withit[Music]hi i put the flowers on my desk and thenafter getting some work donein the evening i read whilst eating somechocolate covered strawberriesvery fancy also luckily no one at thestore asked me whether the flowers andthe chocolate covered strawberries werefor a special someonethey were for a special someone theywere for me i've been wanting todecorate my phonesometimes i get messages that are likeoh you must have such an aesthetic phonesetup and i really don't it's honestlykind of ugly so i think for that i'll doa poll and ask what theme to dowhat else what else i'm also going tojournal so i asked for somejournaling prompts and i'm also going togo on a walk so i asked what podcast tolisten toand you voted for the 10 happier podcastone of the self-care things i'm gonna dotoday is try to curl my hair i neverever do anything in terms of styling myhair but a lot of times i don't reallylike how it looks without any styling soi'm gonna tryto learn i found this amongst oldproducts that my mom is no longer usingi'm pretty sureit offers heat protection so i'll tryusing thisi did not have much patience but iexperimented a little bitand i did something and i like it it'sdifferent i think i just need topractice more butyeah i didn't burn down the house eitherso i think that was a successi went back to dunkin donuts to completemy mission this time i succeeded ingetting my friend that drink and a donutand then i went and dropped that off ather house along with some stuff fromlush it's so cold i'm tearing upmy ears out of the two candle options igave you you voted this onesugared sea salt ser madini don't even know what language that isi'm guessing it's french okay now i'mgonna do a bit of journalingyou guys sent in so many prompts so i'mgonna scroll through and just pick oneand i think i'm gonna share a bunch ofthe others on my stories just for anyonewho needs some journaling prompt ideasokay i like this one this is fromjazzyjelkswhat would happen next in the story ifthis was my movie and you have to answerin the past tense[Music]thursday i'm gonna take a bubble bathwith that bath bombhow do you draw a bathtub okay i'm gonnalisten to

kind of wanted thai food so[Music]it's hereokay i want to decorate my phone now andonce again it was almost 50 50 but thisyellow flower blue sky wallpaper won bya thin marginso i think i'm gonna change thewallpaper to that and then use that as astarting place for designing the rest ofitand then my lock screen is usuallysomething bts related so i'm going tostick with that tradition but try tofind something that's kind ofbluish yellowy to fit oh this looksreally cool alreadyno i accidentally downloaded roblox sohere's what i ended up doing idownloaded widget smith to have moreaesthetic activity ringsi have the date in the corner here and ireplaced all of my app icons with theseones that i downloaded frometsy and then a couple of them are somephotos so this one is forhabit tracking time tracking and thatwas my mood trackeri also used widget smith for my calendarand then i have this one space here thati couldn't figure out what to fill withbut i feel likewith the flowers you barely even noticeit[Music]after a workout i went to go try out thebath bomb which as expectedsmelled really really nice and i alsostarted reading the book when breathbecomes air by paul kalanithi which wasincredible i actually finished readingit that same day i could not put it downit is veryvery moving and beautiful and idefinitely recommend it[Music]i said should i cook breakfast or dinnerit was 54 to 46 but breakfast onethen i said should i watch a tv show oryoutube and you said tv show so thenobviously you're gonna have to pick thetv show because i'm not gonna pick itand thenyou'll go i don't wanna draw a persondoing yoga i've been really trying toavoid having to draw any peopleoh noyou guys voted for me to make a specialbreakfast and i really wanted to makecrepes so i did not put thatup for a vote but i did let you decidewhat the topping wasso you guys picked peanut butter andbanana but honestly i did end up havingbothbecause lemon and sugar i was hopingwould win if you haven't had lemon andsugar on crepes or pancakesi know it sounds a little bit weird butplease try it it's life-changing[Music]before i went to bed i started watchingthe umbrella academywhich was definitely a little weird butinteresting i couldn't finish theepisode though because i was very sleepybut that is not a reflection of thequality of the show it's just it wasvery late and i was very tiredand i completely intend on finishing thesecond half as soon as i cansaturday i'm either gonna watch thesunset orsunrise i wanna buy a book bless youmy brother sneezed i wanna buy a bookfor myselfi'm gonna play a board game with mybrother so you picked riskand then i just wanted to do a guidedmeditation[Music]i move my desk away from the window andback over to this wallso originally if you remember it wasright up against the walland when i'd be sitting i'd be lookingat the grid and then i wanted moresunlight and just a change of view sothen i moved itright up underneath the window and theni got sick of that as well so then imoved it backbut i kept some space so that i can sitin between the wall and the desk andthenlook out upon my room as a moreinteresting viewi think than just looking at the wall sohere's my attempt at multitaskingtoday while i meditate i'm going to tryto do a saltwarm water soak for my nose piercingbecause i've not been doing a good jobof taking care of that so i'm bucklingdown on it this weekthis is one of the only polls thatwasn't near a 50 50split and i can see why the first one'sliterally named depressionwhich is just an unfortunate name oh nolet's do the one that you selectedi was surprised you guys picked sunsetover sunrise but i actually got reallylucky that dayas i was walking i was worried it wasjust too cloudy to see a good sunsetbut then i turned around and i realizedit was so beautiful right behind me sothen i started runningso that i could get to the bridge wherei wanted to watch it from[Music]and then me and my brother played riskwhich like the tv show we also did notfinishit is a very long game but i'm glad youguys picked risk over chessbecause at least with this game i have afighting chance of actually winningi hope you enjoyed the video i hope youlike the interactive polls on instagramthroughout the weeki really enjoy doing them so let me knowif you want more interactive videos likethis in the

hey guys welcome back to my channel orwelcome to my channel if you are new sotoday I thought I would do a little gymshark review slash like show you mycollection and like my thoughts on allof my gym shark stuff I have quite arange of their items I think this isprobably like a pretty representativesample I was super excited because Ijust got the new ombre seamlesscollection they actually just restockedall the hombres which was kind of crazybecause they've never like restockedthem before they've just gotten new onesand like said that's that's the firstthing munch I'm sure it cuz like if youwant so if they're like really cuteitems you have to be there like right asthe launch happens or else you mightmiss it because they sell very quicklyand they don't they don't make enough oftheir product basically like they wantit to be competitive so they just likedon't make it off so I just thought I'dbe going through all what I have trystuff on tell you my thoughts and howthe products have like worn throughoutlike the time that have happened so yeahlet's get startedso first the seamless so actually thesejust shipped to my house yesterday so Iwore them to the gym this morningactually actually just wear the bottomscuz I felt like really extra worriedlike the full top I didn't purchase asports bra I tend to I actually don'thave any gym sharukh sports for us andthat's just because like I just I feellike I don't know I feel weird aboutJess wearing sports part of the gym likeI like you like honest it look it looksgreat when people do it but I just feellike so much like boobage for me so Itry not to do that um so I got like thefull shirt and I've seen people like tiebeasts which I thought it was cute butyeah first I was like I loved thematerial of these it's by far like thebest like the best material of like anylike gym charka thing I own superstretchy I actually brought my likeLululemon top so I kind of compare feltlike you can see like in the fabricsthat they're like they're very similarlike they have the little likeperforations they're both reallystretchy so I really enjoy the fabric ofthese my only problem at the top is thatum well I like the high neck this littlelike it's like the sleeve is so cut outthat if you're like wearing it so it'slike bulging at the top it's like kindof I don't know it shows like way toomuch like at the errand I didn'tpurchase a sports bar to go with it solike you can like totally see my sportsbro just like fine but it doesn't reallygo with the colors so I kind of wish itwasn't so so open here but I really likethe top overall and the leggings aresuper cute I have a few things tocomplain about but first of all they'resuper stretchy I think I fit the bestout of any gym shark leggings I havethey also make your butt look reallynice I've heard some things about likethe top being stretching out but it feltpretty good pretty good from each at thegym they are squat proof didn't seeanything wrong with that yeah I lovelike the little like the littledetailing that goes down the side um myfirst issue with these is that um theylike kind of already like caught a fewtimes like I was like doing like hipthrusts and I had to like slide my legsunderneath the barbell and they alreadyI'm trying to get like a good yeah Idon't know if you can you can even seeit's like so small but okay they'rethey're just a few little catches andalso the little like the little leg butthings they used to be like a likebootie contour kind of thing like that'swhat I said they were but the Eastlakefall unlike my like mid thigh which is alittle strange because like I'm tall soI feel like you'd be like higher up onme but this is like I've seen otherreviews of these and like people havesaid the same thing so I don't reallyknow what they were trying to do withthat it doesn't look like bad thoughlike I wouldn't not get them because ofthis and like all Jim Chuck likings Iwas like a little bit of a camel toesituation but it's nothing extreme likeI said I'd still wear it so yeah overallI was like super excited to get these Igot the pink to UM peach just because Ithought these were like the most subtlein transition but also like super brightand summery and fun yeah this wasdefinitely like my favorite color of thecollection that they just launched okayand so that's why I just purchased butI've made a few other purchases in thepast and now I'm going to go into thoseum first off I'll go into my other sceneso I have the energy seamless and thered color and these are inside-out so Igot these in the red which I just said Ioriginally wanted these on a regularseamless version but they only hadbellick the energy one which was the onethat has like the little um he's alldetailing sorry that's a um but yeah sothese are actually very differentfeeling material then um then these likethis is much more like stretchy and likeI don't knowthat's like tight and these can be likekind of a struggle to get on but likewhat's nice about it it's like once it'son it's like really like really keepsyou in especially with the waist sectionit's really like I don't know it justmakes you feel skinny it also butthere's also like room in the butt solike your butts it looks nice um yeahthese are definitely like a littletighter no they actually do have littlebutt contour thing I never notice thaton these it's very subtle on these onesum yeah I think I like the fit of theombre ones a little better than thisI still do really like these like whatone thing I've noticed with like thewearing of these is that like thoughthis sounds like kind of run a littlebit it's like I like it's very likedelicate like I don't dry my any of myleague after where I hang it dry so Idon't think it was like an issue I waslike in like I know in the cleaning ofit I like you think is public getting iton or just wearing it so do keep in mindif you get these that they can likereally um I don't know kind of runeasily my kind of reminds me of likehelic tights round I just feel like thisis gonna keep stretching and likerunning but I do these are some of myfavorite pants so I saw purchased themagain but I wish they kept making thenon-energy ones cuz I just like they'relike plain ones better okay next item Igot these little these ones i forgotthey're called and that these have likei like these because they had likelittle mesh panels um i'll down the legand they also have like this like meshpanel is actually a pocket we lovepockets so this one's really cutethought it was a nice little like dustylike almost denim color i'm sweatingguys it's like 93right now where I am and it's never thishot and I'm literally dying I almostfainted walking around the mall becauseit was so hot it's a slight exaggerationbut I was feeling my head yeah I reallylike these ones they are sometimes I dofeel like they squish my butt a littlebit but I don't like cuz if I'm tryingto like go to the gym I'm like workingon my bed Oh at least want to take awhiff nice um but they do have like anice like like a seam right under thebutt which kind of helps yeah overall Ilike these they're a little thick solike kind of hard to wear them duringthe summer just because I can I feel sohotbut um yeah overall I like these I feellike they're pretty like a versatilelike better for winter and I've noticedsome new issues like the way of thesehaving to us any pilling anything likethat okay next I got these like two-toneleggings I know some people don't likekitties but like actually these ones arelike super flattering they have likethis like v-frontso like it goes down a little more likeshow more of your abs but it comes up onthe side too like you hide that sectionI think I think that and they also havethis like a little like seemed on theback that like makes your butt lookpretty good yeah these are actually twodifferent materials I haven't beentalking about sweat proof this buteverything has been pretty sweat proofI'm a sweaty gal so we sweat a lot andwe haven't really noticed anythingsometimes if I had like a drip of sweatand it drips on them you can see thatbut like you never like I never knowthis like actual like somewhat ain'tlike I don't know like around like thebutt area which is probably verysweating this he's like no issue withthat sometimes I do know this if I puton one of those little resistance bandsaround my legs around there I do kind ofnotice a little bit of it's funny thatthat's can breathe so sweat will showwhere like you would think it shows andlike doesn't and like the places youdon't really want it to so overall Ireally like these and I've no problemswith them and have really found problemwith the wear sometimes they do feelkind of like restricting to get on likeyou'd like put them on and you're likeyeah like I don't know if these aregonna work but um I have no like feel norestrictions like when I'm actuallyworking out okay I feel like I shouldtalk about some tops and so this is likeone of my favorite favorite tops um thisis to like kind of go with the energyseamless bottoms I have but this is justthe top of itit's like the energy seamless like acrop there's probably kind of vets cuzlike British people call them this butyeah so this it can't became a littlepads and then I took it out I just gotthe black version because I've gottenthe red version to match the red but Ijust wanted the black because I thoughtit would like go with more of my bottomsand so yeah has this front and it's niceand like tight around the ribcage andthen this is the back little littleStrappies and then it has this detailingand they're like same as the pants but Idon't know nothing to say really aboutthese of this one I really like this umI do wear a sports bra under this justbecause I like to be like really likesecured at the gym but this one and Ihave one more top this is when I've likethe the fit little crop um this one Idon't know why I got into small becauselike my boobs are a little too big forthat but it's do I still get it on but Ireally like this one I just feel likeit's nice to kind of be covered up uphere and like still show like some skinand it has a nice little Jim shark bandon the bottom my only issue with this isthat I actually like has are justgetting holes in it and I haven't wantedthat many times you can see like in thearmpit it got a hole that maybe becauseI may be my own fault because like Ihaven't gone like cuz I got like kind ofa small size I still feel like if it waslike a really like I don't know properlyset like it's active where you should beable to like I don't know move around init without those kind of issues okay andso he was after the first thing I gotever from Jim check these hip selectsleggings so I really wanted to love theFlex leggings but they just like I don'tknow like they look flattering on somepeople but I also like see some likeInstagram like Jim check athleteswearing them they just don't look greatI think my main complaint is that likedo you see like how like I really likehigh waisted leggings and you see howlow the front portion is like that'sonly like a few inches and like I knowit's not super flattering on me I dolike how it comes up a little bit in theback so it's like a little higher wastedin the back and the sidebut like I would never wear like just asportswear off this cuz your entirestomach would be showing there these areokay they're actually they go they'relike super the legs are super long andlike I'm five nine and they're like alittle baggy on me so just keep that inmind i by the way i have smalls and allthe leggings and then mediums and likeon the tops except for that one I said Igot small umm but yeah like and I mean Ihave had these for a little while butthey they have see that have shownsomewhere um yeah I just I don't know Idon't wear these much anymore justbecause I don't like it doesn't make mefeel very like confident and skinny Ireally like to like them but they're notmy favorite and to go with those pants Ipurchased this top um I do like this topit does just what super usually thoughbecause it's just cotton so like if youhave like under boob sweat it's gonnashow I'll go show but I'm not okay withsweating I get my shirt a little morethan my pants cuz like I feel like it'sless awkward but you know we should justembrace our sweat it's fineum it's got a cute little open like backthing it's probably covered up wheneverI wear sports bra it's not like thetightest fitting material ever um but Istill I know I still wear this top quitea bit cuz it's super cute I should getbored their shirts because I've likedthick I've liked their tops I did mylast thing and I don't know why I'm likethis by never wear like black leggingsto the gym because I feel like blackleggings are like my like go to classslash like a lounge around in leggingsand I don't want to like ruin them bygoing to class cuz I like that I canmake them last but I really like theseum I forget exactly which kind this is Ireally should've looked that up but umbut it's okay these are just the oneslike the high waist and ones and I likehow these are high waisted like theykind of like cinch in at the top so likecomes in just like makes it makes youlook nice and thin um yeah these are anice materialI have noticed a little bit of pillingin the back I have worn these quite abit and that's like super easy to removewith like just like a little razor

"what's up Alisa exactly Chris areawelcome to another video of the official10x today we're going to show you whyyou need to train with wrist wraps andhow to use them let's get started allright let's get started today I'm goingto show you why you need to train withthis wrap and how to use them so wristwraps are used for extra rinse supportextra wrist support is going to increaseyour ability to support more richpressure that's going to mean more repslonger holds heavier lifts increase thestability and of course healthier jointshaving this wrist wrap here to supportyour wrist is going to keep your wristreally really straight when your wristis really straight really supported likethis tight and breaks it's going toallow you to do more repetitionsnormally when you're working out yourjoint tend to give out before yourmuscles to do so having these is goingto allow you to focus more on therepetitions allowing you to get morereps in there normally when doingstabilizing exercises such as handstandsyou work a lot of that risk and it takesa lot of wrist stability and pressure tobe able to get a nice clean hand stampthese riff-raffs are going to keep yourwrist super straight so even if you feellike wobbling a little bit it's going togive that extra support it's going tofeel a lot easier to balance in yourhandstand or any other stabilizationexercises it's also going to allow youto lift heavier because it has a bracearound your wrist support around yourwrist kind of like when you see powerlifters using a weight belt to help liftheavier weight this is the same thingit's like a mini weight belt for yourwrist so it's going to allow you to havemore pressure on your wrists heavierlifts longer holds and more reps and ofcourse it's a lot healthier on yourjoints when doing exercises involvingjoints and tendons you want to make surethat you're also always protecting yourjoints having healthy joints you'regoing to be able to progress a lot safera lot easier you're not going to hitthat plateau because you're injured sowearing these is going to support yourwrist to prevent injury bykeeping your wrist straight no matterwhat and not allowing to bend your wristpast where it's supposed to all right sonow we're going to do a whole bodyworkout that incorporates all the topicswe just covered we're going to show youhow to apply them with differentexercises so the first exercise is goingto be handstand hold then we're going togo into 90 degree push-ups after we'regoing to go for explosive muscle lipsthen we're going to go into deadliftnext we have one-arm pull-ups after wehave explosive push-ups and then we'regoing to finish off with single arml-sit hold so you guys ready let's gofor it the first one we have handstandhold so we're going to warm up so whendoing this move with the wrist wraps youwant to make sure that just loosen thema little bit and the way that you canloosen them is just take a nice littlegrip and then just twist them theopposite way so what you feel looseseeing so we're going to loosen them upa little bit and the reason why isbecause when we're putting our palmsdown on the ground you want to giveenough mobility in your wrists to beable to be just like this and not haveit like squeezing your wrists okay sowe're going to give it a little bit ofspace so we can move let's go throughthose handstand hold[Music]whoo all rightsmells a nice little warm-up now we getthe workout started so next we're goingto go into 90 degree push-ups now thisis an advanced move where I'm going toshow you guys how to do this move if youwant to learn all the other moves go onto fedex.com and become a member tolearn all these so right now we're goingto go into 90 degree push-ups so nowherewe're holding onto a bar now if you wantto tighten this so hold it a little bitand just go like that it will tighten upso now that it's tighter you can have amore solid more stable Ric now if youtry to put your hand back down on thefloor you're going to feel a little alot of pressure right here so if you'regoing to do more open hands floor stylemoves you want to then loosen it back upa little bit but we're going to keep itnice and tight go to 90 degree push-ups[Music]all right oh my gosh thousand ten let'smove on to the next exercise so now wehave local muscle upso a lot of times when you're doing barmovements explosive bar movement justhaving a grip that's where you firstgive out you know and then it's themuscles right but just even hangingfeels hard having these wraps on you canallow you to keep a stronger grip andmore comfortable you can have supportfor your wrist you're going to be ableto hang like nothing alright so nowwe're going to put these wrist wraps andgrip strength to the test with this nextexercise make sure you loosen a littlebit so you can have mobility in thatwrist go for some explosive Muslims[Music][Music]yep I think they work that's enoughjumping around if you want for the nextexercise next we have deadlifts allright let's go for this so like I saidhaving a Swissport can house is thismore it's going to be more comfortablewhen you lift especially of course it'sgoing to make you do more reps you'll beable to lift longer and everything likethat you're going to get addicted tohaving them on so don't forget that whenyou make those new gains take them offand try to adjust them to your naturalrisk because you want to make sure thatyou're strengthening your wrists too soif you're doing something like deadliftyou start to lift heavier moreconsistently and you're adding more repsas well take them off and try to do thesame thing once you've mastered it withit off put it back on again and keepmaking those games making those progressso now we're going to go over somedeadlifts now to build more strength youwant to go for it three to five reps sowe're going to go for a three to fiveprep range[Music][Music]okay we're almost to the endnext we have one on post[Music][Music][Music]or more each[Music]oh yeah all right now we have explosivepush-ups let's go for itso normally this is another move righthere people do this or they don't liketo do it because they feel like thatexplosiveness it's too much pressurein their wrists so this is definitely ahelp a lot make sure now you loosen it alittle bit if you have more wristmobility you can put your hands

that's that's for sure lingerie thanksfor sure now the body's in they called abodysuitit's very sure lingerie it's like always[Music]first off I'm like I feel like sweatyand stressed right now cuz my mom isgetting like a medical procedure done atthe moment so Jake's filming myassistant Mesa is away in Spain and I'mjust like oh my godwhat's happening with my lives butthat's not what you're here for you'rehere for me shopping on revolve andseeing what's up with they're superexpensive clothes this is definitely Ithink the most expensive yeah definitelythe most expensive store I've shopped atin this series but if you haven't seenthe series hey I'm Molly and I'm blindand I've been trying to online shopwithout sight or help on super hypedonline websites a big box from rebel Ithink I spent like six hundred andthirty dollars on revolve which is hellaexpensive a couple of things to notethey don't have petite sizing and as avery petite girl I was like concernedabout how long a lot of the stuff wouldbe on me I'm four foot ten and a halffor reference my measurements are 30 2636 so I was pretty concerned about thatI usually try to get a pair of shoes butI've so many freakin shoes none of themcaught my eye until of course like twodays ago when I went back on revolve andfound these super cute Jeffrey Campbelljelly sandals here they are right herethey're so stinking cute I totally wouldhave ordered those if I had seen thembefore I made this order but I did ordera bunch of different stuff I haveathletic clothes I have dresses I havelike trendy cute stylish things and Ibought from a bunch of different brandsbecause just like dolls kill revolvejust sells a bunch of different randombrands most of them are super priceythey have the odd brand that isn't quiteas expensive but for sure this is like ahigh-end online boutique they had likedecent descriptions their website waslike pretty easy to useshipping was super fast and free it waslike I got it into less than two daysand it was free shipping who turnedlabel it like comes with a printed-outreturn label free returns 30 days for afull refund or 60 days for exchange so Ifeel like that's what you expect likewith such an expensive store I wouldexpect this and I will also say I wasonly inspired to shop and revolvebecause of Coachella that just shows youthe power of Coachella and social mediamarketing I was I fell victim to iteverybody was like at the revolveCoachella party and I was like revolvelook at them stepping up their socialmedia marketing I bought stuff okay Idon't even know what I've just pulledout so I know Nike is like a mainstreamcommon brand so I knew they're likequality for their Nike sports bra wouldbe like pretty good but I don't ownanything nike up until now I've alwaysbeen more of like a yoga pilates thatkind of vibe so I've shopped like Airyto chika and Lululemon but now I've beengetting into gym workouts and I havebeen meeting more like real supportivegym clothes and I got this super cutegym shark outfit but I need to wear asports bra under it so I just wanted aplain white sports bra and this was likeI think like 30 bucks which compared toeverything else on their website wascheap so I was like I'm gonna get thisokayso it's like super tight to get on butthat's what I noticed in my gym sharkvideo I'll link that below and I thinkit's just cuz like this is my first timetrying like true high intensity gymclothing which compared to like I feellike a yoga wear which is more like it'sjust not it doesn't need to be as tightit's like tight but it's definitely theright size it's flattering because Idon't care like that fat bulge thearmpit fat I don't get that in thiswhich I really really like it's likesuper supportive like I don't have hugeboobs to support but I have enough boobthat if I don't have like I'm strappedin when I'm working out we're gonna havesome problems I'm locked in place likethis is super supportive I love this braI'm actually super happy with this let'ssee what else we got in here so I knowthat this is probably the light bluedress I ordered and I think I orderan extra small but I know for this I waslike ah is it gonna be liketight-fitting around my booty and myhips like should I go up a size but Iwas just like you know what Molly or thesizes you would typically order from anyother brand cuz that's a reality like Ialways order extra small addresses Inoticed so much of the stuff Igravitated towards was this brand somuch of the stuff I liked it was likesuper down super down I had to stopmyself from buying so

perfectly the length Ifeel like is good on me which issurprising but makes me wonder like if Iwas a tall girl I feel like this wouldbe shortI think the quality feels really niceone of the things that I liked aboutsuper down is compared to the otherbrand it wasn't actually that expensivelike I think this dress was like 60bucks this struggle is just gonna bemyself suppose myself to the internet ohI already know what these are and I'mreally excited about it these areleggings oh they don't feel very highwaisted like that's like a skinnywaistband I feel like usually awaistband like a bad thick these werepretty expensive for like a pair ofleggings I have like two other pairsthat are similar for this by twodifferent brands and I love and wearthem so much when I'm like dressing upand going out and trying to look cutebut I want to be comfy and I was like Ireally need a new pair cuz I wear mineto death they'll help replace my otherones I'll just with my wife I think Igot into small cuz they were out ofextra small maybe here's the tea it'slike a ribbed babydoll tee it's not likesuper soft like it feels like a nicerquality than brandy melville you likeI'm spoiled cuz I wear a lot of clothesfrom American Eagle and they're so softI find it so hard to find good basicand I think it's cute it's like a littlecropped it's just above my belly buttonI feel like it runs maybe like a littlesmall definitely meant to be likeform-fitting what brand are theseleggings their tag is like coral theirtag it's fancyit's like feel it it's like thick rubberno Wow look crazy I got a size smallwhich is usually what I'd wear a leggingI could dress them up with like a pairof heels and like a cute like sparklycrop top or something or like a velvetcrop top or something like that yeah Ithink you can dress these up or down Imean like I said I already have twopairs really similar and I love themsome of you will relate to this you knowI got I got hips so I ordered my typicalsize small which is what I wearingleggings and when this like waistbandhere the stitching here got to like midthigh you could start to hear like I waslike are they gonna go over my butt likethey fit once they're on but I do feellike this waistband isn't the mostflattering like I feel like it doesn'tsmooth my lower stomach out as much aslike some other waist bands on pantshave on leggings like I said it's likethinner like it's not as like wide andthe stitching is quite like thick Idon't know what do you think does itlook okay on my tummy yeah it does Iswear by it looks it looks like normallike laying this anywhere let's sayabout seeing okay I think this is gonnabe the cardigan because it feels like achunky like knit material I ordered thisbecause it said it was like a metalliccardigan isn't that material weirdinteresting it like feels weird it waslike in betweenmaterial and metal yeah like it doesn'tit's not soft by any means yeah so I canjust flip this one over what I'm wearingoh it's like definitely scratchy on yourskin it has a belt that you could removeif you wanted to just like wear it aslike an open cardigan I don't know howit looks on me but I do feel like it's afun dressy cardigan Ireally probably wear it over like thist-shirt I'd wear like a cute black bandoor black crop top I feel like I wouldmuch more wear it open I feel like thebelted it's just like weird you can justslip it out of the belt it's not acasual I feel like you could again dressit up or down which I like I likeclothes that are really versatile yeah Ilike this this is crazy I've never seenanything come with that hanger in a boxagain I feel like that's how you knowit's a Gucciit's a denim jacket with a shearlinglining it was on sale for like 50 bucksI think so I was like well let's justsee what their sales sections like ohokay I liked the whole things line thisis one of the pieces I liked debated themost size-wise because I got an extrasmall but extra extra small it wasavailable and this was frustratingbecause I couldn't see the picture ofcourse so I was like is it oversize oris it fitted because if it's oversizedI'll get extra extra small but if it'sfitted I'll get extra small so I waslike super stressed and the descriptionof the product like I looked under sizeand fit I looked under the productdescription detailsit didn't say if it was an oversized ortailored fit kind of feels oversizedyeah it kind of looks oversized to metoo but it's a look you know I know no Ifeel like it fits decent I feel like Iwould like it hit a little higher likeif I was getting like my dream world thesleeves are also lined with like afabric that's soft it's not like supersoft but it's like a soft cotton I feellike this is a good winter denimjacket.look for LA this is like a reallygood winter denim I like it I don't knowif I'll keep it or not but I do like itso I just have so many denim jacket Ilove denim jackets this I'm nervousabout becausedidn't have an extra-small oh it's ajumpsuit it's a jumpsuit it does looklike you're holding above your headright now and it's touching the groundlike Splenda they have a store at thegrill of a splendid store at the Groveand they also sell splendid at Nordstrommost things I noticed only came in likeone color option for a lot of things butthere was certain things like these camein lots of color options in fact Ibought a second colorOh for just appalled still even whenI've tightened them the tightest they'restill like way too big I would usuallywear it Rallis so that's what the backlooks like which is very prettydefinitely would be better an extrasmall like extra small is 100% my sizeand that's it's so stinkin cute as likea lounge e-soo and it has like thisdifferent textured fabric down the sideI don't know if you can tell it's like astripe of different fabric down the sidedoesn't have pockets which is sad I haveit like scrunches at the ankles so youcan like roll it up like that you knowwhich i think is cute like I wouldprobably mostly wear it scrunched uplike that where it's like cute andcasual it's not as bad as I thought itwas gonna be but it's not as good as Ihoped it would be cuz I think it's socute okay I'm gonna see if I can findthis anywhere else online because thisis the kind of outfit I would wear everySinkin day of my life I think this is anoutfit ooh this feels like quality whichit should because it was expansive sothis is like a sports bra ooh the backis like all of these Strappies okay I'mstoked to try this on I would honestlylike wear this more like a top love waveokay this this brand was everything waspriceythey had mostly swimsuits someactivewear and some like swimsuitcover-up five like some dresses that youthrow over your swimsuit kind of thingand these are the matching pumps whichagain I got white because I thought it'srisky it'sexpose you if they are high qualitythick white material white is like anotoriously unflattering colorespecially for like a like like black isslimming white makes the most you knowso I usually don't wear white pantsbecause my thighs are on the six sidebut I want it to like experiment that'swhy I was doing this I was like let'sthrow it out there and see what we'vegot okay let's start with the top it'sdefinitely more supportive than Iwould've thought but like your girlswill be bouncing cuz like clearlythey're like on this wayif you're doing a treadmill they'regonna be agonizing gyms like you know soit's definitely not like a treadmillrunning workout bra but like cuteaesthetically I think and then this isthe back of it which is really cute sothat's like the other crisscross andthen these like nine it's definitelymore supportive than I thought it wouldbe these are interestingI didn't realize they'd be cropped whichon me they're obviously not supercropped cuz I'm super short but usuallycrop things on me or actuallyfull-length like if it's cropped onsomebody else that's like full length onme they're a really nice materialthey're thick like this the morewaistband I like like I feel like it hasthe tummy control I wore a darkunderwear on purpose so that if it wassee-through we'd know yeah I mean Idon't know if it's flattering or not youknow it's comfy I feel like like I saidI would more likely do it as likeathleisure like throw it down I'm jacketand sneakers on like Molly's go to orlike the throw cute like pink orlavender faux fur jacket on and sneakersI think it would look cute we're down tolike youyeah so I have two things here go withthis like hide my stomach you sit youknow you get that nice you know we'rehuman people these are a nike short Iwould never work out in these ever everever because I don't have sideconfidence to wear these so I wouldnever wear these on their own I boughtthese purely to go under like t-shirtdresses and sweater dresses you knowit's not as bad as I expected in termsof like thigh squashing again stillwouldn't personally have the confidenceto like where are these in the gym ontheir own when you are I'm in front of amillion people on the Internetthat's my job Jake so what I signed upfor here you know they're comfortable Ilike that they're high-waisted you knowyou're really seeing the most body I'llhave to like try them on under a coupleof the t-shirt dresses that I intendedto wear them under and see if you canlike see that the stitching or the bandor anything oh my gosh are these theother pair of my shiny pants coralthey're supposed to be copper theyaren't copper and I didn't think theywere gonna come in in this box I mean Iguess we know what they look like butI'll try them on anyways interestinglyenough these fit bigger than the blackones um these were a wild card thesewere like a let's see how this goes butthe intention was like I thought like awhite crop top white heels like my whitebooties black leather jacket going outat night something like that I don'tknow I just thought I'd give it a trybecause my other shiny leggings are allblack yeah like if you cut my head offokay and this was like another girl whohad like blonde hair brown hair kind ofworries especially nothing to worry thatis that gold copper Hilary okay this wasalso a wild cardwhat is that it was in there like sojust like with most videos I did a lotof searching but I also went to buy alot of their brands which quickly becameoverwhelming so then I started goingthrough categories and this was in thelike lingerie category but said it was abodysuit that's that's for sure lingerieI shared on the bodysuit they called abodysuitit's very sure on lingerie it's likealways if I had a boyfriend then yadon't have this purposes for it this isa big right but molly is single yeah ifI could see girls wearing this with somelike nip covers on going to CoachellaI'm not gonna try it on cuz Jake's hereand that feels weird this is an exampleof me being really blind because if Ihave looked on the website I probablywould have been like that's lingerie sohere's what I think about revolve okay Ithink that shopping without sight justlike in all these videos it's like hardfor me because I shop through touch Ishop through feeling everything I feelas fabricsI feel the shapes and that's how Ipicked the clothes that are best for meso do I think I made the best decisionsfor my body type and my style no but ifI had like my mom sitting at thecomputer with me helping me shop I would100% buy from evolve like like it couldbe a problem everything feels likeprofessional I think it's cool that theyhave a lot of brands that I've neverheard of they have a lot of brands fromlike Australia or England or like aroundthe world that you maybe wouldn't haveaccess to I don't necessarily loveeverything I got I think I'll probablylike return some stuff keep some stuffbut overall I don't think I can faultone thing on its qualityand this is I think like the first videowhere nothing to me has been like badquality this is Jim shark I don't knowprice tag I think is worth it if you'regetting stuff that's going to that'sclassic and it's gonna be a long termand you can have it in your wardrobeforever and it's not just like a superpassing trendy piece I think it's worthspending the money and I think revolveis somewhere where you can find thosepieces and it would be worth puttingyour money into it so those are mythoughts and revolve now I really wantto go shop on revolve with my mom so shecan help me pick out stuff that'sactually gonna look good on me let meknow what your favorite piece I tried onin this video was let me know what youthink cuz Jake I love you but maybe likenot the best with my fashion advice yeahokay I love you guys very much let meknow also where you want to see me shopfrom it next and I'll see you

hi guys welcome back to lead fit ChannelI'm three and a half of lead fit andtoday's video is a very honest detailedTryon review and haul of the WhitneySimmons ex gym shock collection I paidfor all of these pieces with my ownmoney not sponsored have no affiliationwith gym shark or Whitney Simmons but Iam a huge fan of Whitney's but I'm alsogoing to tell you everything you need toknow from a consumer perspective andsomeone who's a little bit curvier I am5'4 I weigh about 136 poundsI have 32d bra size typically I'mactually 28 around usually wear a pantsize around 28 27 because I do have hipsand thighs but a size four in dresses[Music]some information about the collection itis launching on Thursday I have afeeling it is going to sell out and sellout fast all the pieces I'm showing youI bought a size small I went to theWhitney Simmons X Jim shark pop-up in LAon Saturday with my friend SamanthaSousa she got us tickets and we waitedin line for three hours to get in toshop the collection it was actually veryhard for me to only stick to the fourpieces I told myself I wanted to try andpurchase it they fit the great thingabout the pop-up was that we were ableto try everything on and they did sellout at the pop-up a couple of the piecesI believe the grey bomber sold outwithin the first two hours if you'relooking for the bomber jackets I woulddefinitely recommend picking those upimmediately and getting online thesecond it goes live let's get into theTryon and I'll talk about each singlepiece at this point I've worn all thepieces and washed all the pieces atleast once I also wanted to let you guysknow that I do have a very honest gymstructure on video over on my mainchannel serene WA which I will link inthe description box do you like Jimshark but there's some negatives to itand I'm gonna explain that as I tryeverything on but so you can see howeverything wears let's move into theTryon portion the first piece I want totalk about is the bra and as I mentionedI'm a 32d in most sizes and what Ireally love about this bra is thattypically to get the support I need tobe able to do hit training typical gymworkouts I can't get this type of a liftthe entire collection is so flatteringon someone who has boobs someone who hassighs and hips this just looks so goodon my chest do have the cup inserts inthere and you can take them out easilyif you prefer not to I love thisdetailing I think it definitely elevatesit it gives you a little something tolook atthe detailing of it's a beautiful day tobe alive is just noticeable enough butnot distracting or overwhelming it'ssuch a great staple style and I have itin pink I also have it in green anyoneis dirty since I purchased these bras atthe pop-up I have learned them literallyevery single day unless they both weredirty and in the wash and thinking aboutpurchasing the black and the blue aswell just because I love these bras somuch a ban is incredibly secure but itdoesn't pinch and it doesn't feel likeit's gonna move anywhere if you don'tlike this cutout you can just go likethat most of the times when I'm actuallyvery active and working out the cutouthonestly does just kind of disappear Ithink if you had a flatter chest yourcutout would be more noticeable as youwork down there's the rose gold bar withthe Whitney X Jim shark so it's verynice very simple doesn't get in the wayI thought it might I've done my workoutdays in them and you can see onInstagram I don't have any issues withthis and then the back detailing islovely I really really love the circularcutout every class the best part aboutthis bra is that she raised this part sotypically you would have a little bit ofbulge coming out from your bras butbecause she raised the height of itthere's less bulging happening it's veryflattering fit and I feel verycomfortable and confident in this brawhich isn't always the case shopping fora sports bra for my actual boob size andwidth has been very challenging to findthe support and also the aesthetic thatI like the fabric is phenomenal Iabsolutely cannot believe she helpedmake a fabric that was very similar tothe Lululemona line fabric I love the Lululemon aline crop leggings those are myride-or-die leggings and this fabric isvery very similar to it incrediblystretchy incredibly compression it alsohas the most butter like soft feel andit feels so comfortable on when I sawWhitney try these on in her video I knewI had to try these on and most likelywas good to buy these these are just agreat lounge set I really love howhigh-waisted these joggers are I have avery long torso so high-waisted itemsdon't always look high-waisted on me butthese actually are a true high waist Ialso like the detailing of this thickerband the thicker band is very nice andflattering especially those of us whoyou know have a lower belly pooch or arejust still working on this area likethat it's an actual crop jogger becausea lot of times at five four my legs arenot long enough by any means to makeanything look cropped but these comeright at the ankles and if you wanted toyou can cinch it up a little bit more togive it more of that jogger feel pocketsare also really nice because they have azip lot of times if you're out andactive things tend to fall out of yourpockets this is really nice and secureyou can zip up both sides of the pocketspack is also quite flattering sometimeswith joggers I find that you can have alittle bit of a diaper but going on butI don't think it's too bad back here Iam wearing the sports bra and you barelysee any skin here so it's perfect topair with a sports bra it's so cute ifyou throw on the bomber jacket if youwant to get the bomber jacket I wastrying to be good and not get thatreversible bomber jacket for Californiaweather I'm good for most of fault ismore of that gym Trek fabric that I'mused to bought my husband a pair ofjoggers from Jimand I feel like this is very similar tohis fabric it's not super rough it is athicker material it's a little bitsofter than his but definitely that samethicker Jim shark material I am in asmall in this as well it is a little bitbaggy er but I like that look if youwant it to be more fitted I would saysize down if you want it to be bag herestick to true to size you don't want togo too big on this because the wholepoint is to still have that cinchedwaist the gold bar detailing here therose gol with the Whitney Simmons X Jimshark very subtle but still there andthen I also like the Jim shark logo verysubtle but still there on the left anklethese leggings are butter they feel isso freakin soft they hug every piece ofyou but compress it so it looks nice andI just really love that it's an actual7th 8th legging on me I don't havereally long legs I'm actually kind ofdisproportional from torso to legsactually elongates my leg true highwaist again on even somebody with alonger torso or we get into thedetailing let me just do a squat testthis is natural light I'm wearing a sizesmallI feel completely comfortable andconfident squatting in these the gymlighting doesn't seem to have had anyissues I don't feel like I'm showingeverything but I feel like I'm wearingsuch a lightweight piece of fabric thatit's so comfortable I literally feellike I'm not wearing anything in thesebut still feel really secure held in inthe areas I want to be held in so thewaistband is a thicker waistband thatdoes come in which I really love becauseit accentuates that hourglass look it'svery very flattering a true high waistdefinitely has that compression you cansee it's holding a little bit in mylower belly I also love the detailing onthe back it's very subtle with alaser-cut but then the seam goes downkind of creating more of that highlightfor your bum and it really gives you anice flattering booty look in blackbecause when I was in the store it wasawful awful lighting it had this weirdoverhead LED lighting that was reallybizarre so I was actually trying on thepink leggings and I noticed in thatlighting that it looked like you couldsee the dimpling in my legs I didn'tthink I had that much dimple ink but forwhatever reason with the lighter fabricunderneath that lighting it made me feelvery very self-conscious not something Ithink in normal situation you would evernotice because I saw all the other girlswearing the lighter shades like the pinkand the brick and the light gray and theblue and the teals nobody had dimplingit definitely accentuates with a lightercolor you're gonna see every little bitof your leg and your booty but there wasno dimpling there was no weird celluliteshowing I think it was just in thepop-up dressing room that awful lightingthat made me very self-conscious so Idecided to go with the black here on thewaist you'll see the small detailing ofthe gold rose gold Whitney Xgoldbar just really love these leggingsthis is something that's gonna be astaple of mine again the fabric remindsme of the Lululemon align fabric whichis phenomenal it's about almost half theprice then the hulu lemon ones so thoseare all of the pieces and I feel likethe most core collection of WhitneySimmons X Jim shark collection I hope itwas able to help you out a little bit ifyou were trying to decide which piecesyou would like to buy and if you wantedto like get a opinion on whether or notthe fabric was as soft as she says it isher as long as I've been followingWhitney I truly feel like she's reallygenuine and honest about everything shetalks about she's not gonna lie to youabout things and you know there's alwaysa skepticism and even I was a littleskeptical I kow soft is this fabric howlightweight is this fabric howflattering is it gonna look on my bodycuz her body is sick I was really reallypleasantly surprised it's more than Iactually think that I thought thiscollection was gonna be I'm very happyto report that the fabric is phenomenaland I really feel like Whitney did agreat job at creating a collection thatwas missing from Jim sharks corecollection to begin with I havepurchased many items from Jim shark inthe past and I love what they're doingand I like their price point but myissue was I felt like the fabricsweren't thin enough soft enough butteryenough to compete with Lululemonnecessarily and obviously Lulu is alittle bit of a higher price range andwhat Whitney was able to do is reallycreate this really nice soft lightweightfabric that still is mostly squat proofin most of the colors I feel like theperformance wise these performincredibly well like I expect Jim sharkto perform actually I think it performsa little better I think she fixed a lotof the styling issues and fit issueswith some of Jim's trucks previouscollection I really think it was verywell thought out it's somethingdifferent from what Jim shark normallyoffers which I appreciate it's not justsomething where they throw it togetheror she picked a couple colors it wasvery very well designed well styled wellthought out I am most likely gonna buymore pieces if I can get my hands on iton Thursday when it launches set youralarms I have a feeling this collectionis gonna sell out fast also got to meetWhitney Simmons we waited in line towait for her and meet her and I'm reallyhappy I did I don't typically do thatvery often but she's one of those thatis always very positive and veryinspiring and just has a great aura andenergy about her when I was trying toget fit again and on my own fitnessjourney trying to get out of this funk Iwas in she was a recommendation for myfriend Samantha to start watching andshe really gave me a lot of routines andideas to get into the gym again and notfeel so lost even though I worked withpersonal trainers in the past it's justhard to get back in when you've been outfor a while watching her gave me a goodbase point to kind of start fitnessagain and be inspired and alwayswatching her videos just made me feelhappier and more motivated it'sincredible I can't believe for as youngas she is how great of a head on hershoulders she has and how positive andjust energetic and truly genuine andengaging she is and I'm really happythat my money did not go to wasteI'm really happy that I was supportingsomeone I truly love and that is just asgenuine in real life as she is on herYouTube channels washed both theleggings and the bras twice now what Ido is I turn them inside out and I washit on cold water delicate cycle milddetergent and I hang dry everything sofar it looks just as good as when Ifirst purchased it I will have toobviously wash it for a couple moremonths to really let you know how it'swearing by that point that collection isover so but I did my best and try towash it as much as I could without beingweird about washing it love love lovelove the collection specifically the braand the leggings I went with the blackleggings I might actually go back andpurchase the pink leggings or the greenleggings might get the other colors inthe

20-something perfect fitness modelgirls on Instagram I mean moms like meand maybe you if you wanna learn andwatch this video and by the end you'regoing to know just what to look for andwhat to avoid at all costs I promise andfor the best fitness and lifestyle tipsplease subscribe below and remember tohit the alarm bell so that you getnotified every time I put up new videoslike this that help you figure out somecool life hacks for mom so I'm some workout some fitness tips nutrition tips andall sorts of stuff in between okay tipnumber one you have to look at the seamsthe seams are so key so depending onyour build you're gonna want a wider ormore narrow waistband I think mostflattering is a higher waist and youwant to see if there's a front seam anda back seam and these are reallyimportant the back seam is your bestfriend because it's going to give yousome separation back there which reallyhelps give you a flattering look and thefront seam sometimes it's essential whenyou have the back seen that would makesense but that isn't always the case soI have one pair I'll show you guys thathave a back seen but no front seam thatis like genius the front seams sometimescan give you you know your beloved cameltoe situation nobody really wants butsometimes it's worth the price ofadmission for the effect in the back sothat's tip number one these are my veryfavorite black leggings there from Spanxit's like the only thing I have fromSpanx because I hate compression stuffit makes me crazy and I don't think itlooks good on me but these are likeamazingwinter tight because they're prettythick but I have been known to wear themin the summer with like heels and alittle top because they're suck you forgoing outthey are that holy grail where they havethe back seam and a little contour herebut no friends seem very tough to dovery cool super long mine are let's seean extra small and these also hold upvery well they're beautiful with theirgreat example of why seams really matterbecause this might give you the benefitof bothyes seam in the back no seam in frontokay tip number two compression isn'talways your friend so especially if youmaybe have a couple towns you'd like tolose or you are just kind of a biggerframe you're going to assume that highcompression is what you want that isn'talways the case and I for instancereally don't like compression there'sjust sort of the sweet spot of lightcompression that I think looks good onme but just bear that in mind whenyou're looking at them look at thisspandex percentage and just feel themlike pull on them and feel if they aregoing to really squash you in becausesometimes that kind of for me it makesme have like no but at all which is notthe look I'm going forit's all pretty hard-earned for my creamso think about the compression levelokay don't assume you're gonna love itif it's super tight and it's gonna justsuck you in that might be what you wantbut it isn't necessarily the mostflattering nd GTM my very favoritetights ever I would not know about thesetights without a video like this that Iwatched a while back so hence my passionfor legging hauls these are incrediblethey are exactly right from my body theyhave a compressive high waistband andthen they have a very low compressionleg with beautiful detailing it's kindof tone on tone so it's not tooobnoxious and these are like a forestgreen which I never would have boughtbefore but I thinklike really pretty on they have theirsignature foodie contour and a lot ofextra fabric here because you'resupposed to hike them up girlsdefinitely in the back and if you're notdoing it just know pretty much everybodyelse is so just do it and then you knowfix the front up a little bit and justgo with it because it looks I think it'sso good in the back okay for tip numberthree it doesn't have to be black I knowthat's most people save spot but Ireally think that lighter coloredleggings are more flattering especiallyif you're kind of an athletic or curviergirl because you want to highlight yourshape you don't just want it all toblend in and look like nothing youreally want to show all that hard workor show like your god-given gifts butdon't hide them away so be open-mindedabout color scheme and I'll show you awhole range but I personally preferlight colored leggings I think they justthey just look best can't do a legginghaul without something sharp becausethey're so awesome these are theirseamless align no these are their vitalsseamless and I got this kind of heathergray which I think counts as a lightcolor they have very cool detailing theyhave no front seam they're seamless andin the back they don't have a scene butthey have kind of like a pressed Ridgewhich is like a like a shadow of a seambut it helps it definitely helps giveyou some separation they have the selfbootie contouring here very subtle inthis model and some cool atom detaildown the legs love these the brand newis really small they're amazing and allthe tights are tried on today our squatproof by the way even though I didn'treally talk about that as one of my tipsbut I'm just thinking about like overalllook of your leggings these are amazingokay tip number four you want to againassess the height of the waistband sosometimes it can look really pretty tohave a very wide waistband and someI can kind of cut you off I'm a reallyshort torso so I need to go high-waistedbut then the way that I pair it with thetop really matters because it can makeme look like I have no waist like it'slike boobs and hips and nothing inbetween so think about the waistbandthink about whether or not you want tobe able to roll it down think about ifit cuts into you that's never great andjust kind of feel it because a lot ofthese sites have a different compressionaround the waist which I love and I'llget into you really want to be thinkingabout how it's gonna look through yourmiddle versus how it's gonna lookthrough your legs so you might want tohire compression in the middle of theday so for instance on these Lululemonaligns the seam is kind of see how it'skind of contoured down very subtle thisis a great kind of starter contour seambut they have a back seam and a frontseam the back seam is awesome reallyhelpful and the front seam can get youin a little bit of trouble but not toobad on these so these are you know someof my most beloved tights and they havea million beautiful colors they're veryexpensive but they last and you justdon't want to like beat them up too muchbecause they're a little bit fragile butif you take good care of them in thelast two a very long time and you'llkeep pulling them again and again andagain okay the last tip tip number fiveis to look at the detailing some typesnowadays have really cool contouringfeatures that may look scary but reallycan make all the difference in youlooking amazing in your tights so I likelike a subtle bootie contours sometimesif I'm feeling it I'll go for like abooty scrunch I know it's scary and thenthey have like you know sometimes havedetailing down to the legs the kind ofreally highlight if you have muscularlegs like me you can make you can kindof show them off you know you don't haveto put them in black tights and justpretend they're not there like youlike hey look at these legs now we havethe out philippe halo leggings I didHolland nieces well these are also alight color as I said these have a verycompressive waistband these are probablyhigher compression for me but they havelots of fun details and a lot of likemesh paneling see and they have bootycontour that is not see-through thankGod you can see there the patternchanges and they have like an e panelbut they just look really cool on andthey they're highlighting your sort ofmuscles beautifully and they are abeautiful blue trying them I am a formerfitness model many years ago I carriedfor baby as I have three live births andyou know I've gone up and down the scalemultiple times in my life so I lovehelping my friends and clients gettowards a higher level of fitness ifthat's their goal or just a generalsense of well-being and basically I

new glasses new gym sharkwell hello welcome welcome back if thisisn't your first time herei'm damien your friendly neighborhoodfitness friend and today we are going togo overjim training collection now this is thecollection gym sharkstarted doing about a year maybe twoyears agotime is so different now and i've neveractually tried ithonestly the only one of the collectionsi've never really ventured intoi don't know what put me off maybe i sawa couple reviews that weren't tooflatteringbut then they brought some new stuff outand they had some reallycute prints and colors and it reallymade me finally take the punch okay sofirst upi'm going to start with the leggings nowthe training collection leggings comein a whole bunch of different lengthsthey've got the full length the 7athe cadburys the shorts and then theshort shortsand then blue shirts as well they got awhole bunch of different stuff in italthough i recognized that this timearound with their drop they didn't bringout any of the regular shorts just theshort shorts whichpersonally i mean i think they'resupposed to be for likecrossfit and sprinting but theythey really do give me panties like ii couldn't get away with it even if iwanted to maybefor lounging around at home but even atthati don't i don't know but yes back to theleggingsokay so this is themthis actually don't say what length theyare when you get them on the websitebut i got them mostly because that printwas calling out to me i love a good camoand this is more of an abstract kind ofgeometric lookingcamo um when you hold it up it lookslike the waist got a little dip in thefront but you can't tell that when youput them onthese are definitely more of a high riselegging than a high waisted leggingso they'll hit you right about whereyour belly button iswhich doesn't really work for me becausei like my leggings to siton top of my belly button and i feellike that brings out myshape a little bit more it also has alittle elastic at the top of thewaistbandwhich doesn't come in doesn't cause anyproblems for me but that's because istill got a little bit of boomin the waist and this is the extra smalland with all my measurements everythingwill be down in the description boxbelowto help you guys out the leggings alsohave a really tallwaistband i think this is the tallestwaistband which i actually doand this actually covers the whole tummyarea but then there's no compression inthe leggings soit doesn't really help it just kind ofsits there um the fitting on the rest ofthe leggings is finein the back of the leggings it's got alittlev that it comes in to a pointbut honestly that doesn't help i thinkthe v is always there so it makes yourbutt look nice but in these leggingsthat doesn't quite workbecause it just sits there it doesn't doanythingi'd say these are definitely more of aseven-daylegging even though it doesn't say thaton a website because on me it hitsabove the ankle so if you're taller theymight come up looking likeyou're wearing a much younger child'sleggingso keep that in mind now when it comesto the material these are made of theseare made ofsoft kind of silky filling materialthey're notthick at all they're kind of thin butthe thing with thatmaterial is it kind of slips and slideslike even just wearing it to try it oni had to keep pulling them off so icannot imaginetrying to work out in these leggings atall i think these would therevery much be a lounge lighting for methe other thing about this leg is toknow is they've got that littlerubberized logo on the back of it andyou know with theseif you're not careful with washing themyou will lose the logo in notime these are gymshark's mostaffordable leggings i think they're thecheapest ones they do on the websiteand i understand what i'm trying to gofor butthey don't quite work they're not quitethere yet when it comes togetting a legging that's good forworking out inyou would have to keep like i saidpulling them upall the time mostly probably because ofthat little space in the waistband theelastic at the top didn't hold it for meat all andit's got a good amount of stretch in itbut it still felt a little bit tightaround the thighs even with that soi'm really not sure about doing any kindof movement in there maybe if you'rejust looking for leggings to sit aroundthere and only watching netflix and idefinitely saygo for these okay next up we have thisrazorback bra also in that same greencamo now this is what kind of confusesme on the trainingcollection is maybe are they supposed tobe more of a lounge collection becausethis particular bra that matches thoseleggings umit doesn't have any support in it at allevenfor me and i'm not that large in thechest it doesn't come with any cut padsat all and there's no way to put them inum it's got this rippedmaterial at the bottom of the waistbandon the insidewaistband bra band on the inside to kindof hold itin place i guess but the rest of the bradoesn't haveany support in it at all umit's pretty much kind of a basic lookingstylea little scoop neck in the front thatcomes together into a razorback styleat the back not really much else to sayabout itit'll be pretty comfortable actually soagaindefinitely going to go more into thelast section of my wardrobe thanin the workout section next up we havethe trainingblue shorts or lucy and shortsi'm not quite sure uh now these shortsare one of the mostraved about things on gymshark not justfrom this collection but in generalpeople are alwaysgoing out about them and how great theyare and i can kind of see whybecause there's a lot of room in theshort so it givesplenty of space for any kind of movementyou want to dothe waistband has this little elasticsilicone sticky things to help the waiststay up but then it's alsoquite huge on me so that doesn'tnecessarily work that wellbecause of all the space it gives at thetop umit's made from a really superlightweightmaterial that's actually a little bitkind of see-through so i would suggestyou wear somethingunder these shortsoh maybe that's what the short shortsare for they're for wearingunder these shorts when you want to workout sonot everything's on show but even theni'm not quite sure how that would workbecausethese um can come up quiteshort like if you make a wrong move youwillhave all your asterisks on the showsimilar to the other onenow they try to account for that alittle bit because if you look atthe shorts the back comes up a littlelonger than the front but even at thatthat just barely covers me so if youmove around too much in themyou might end up exposing something so iwill be keeping thismainly for home workouts but i woulddefinitely be giving this a gofor a leg day because they allow for somuch maximummovement and they're super comfortableplus i got them in thissuper fun geometric print andblack and white all right next we haveone of my favorite sports bars that jimshark makeswhich are from the training collectionas well and they're the v-necksports bars now i know most peopleprefer the rouge ones and they're alwaystalking about them but for me these onesare so much more flattering they've gota little bit of a curved beatin the front to give a tiny little bitof cleavage withlittle thin straps that come together inthe backnow there's no room for adjusting oranything sothese might come up more loose supportif you have a bigger chest but for mei find them to be about a medium supportanywayum they've got a thicker bra band at thebottom just kind of keep everything inand these ones have cut pads in them forthat littleextra support if you're looking todip your toe a little bit in thetraining collection bars i woulddefinitely suggeststarting with this one okay next i'vegot some honorary men's shoes and notnecessarily part of the trainingcollection and i actually don't knowwhat collection they're part ofthey're just something that gymsharkreleased and i findsuper great so i'm gonna start off withthe shorts in this green camera coloragain it's not your regular standardcamo it haslight green and dark green a little bitto brown and then they kind of look alittle bit likepink splashes these were initiallyreleasedwell this style anyway in color burstwhich looked more like tie and then igot the shortsin those and i really like them so wheni saw this i had to go for it againthey're very loose fitting kind ofshorts if you're looking to get asnugger fit you couldsize down if you want to it's up to youbut they do also come with a drawstringon the inside to tighten the waistso the rest of it is nice and loose andthey're not too tight and you can loungearound in themall day um my biggest qualms with thisthoughis pockets it only has one pocket andthat'sin the back of themum it's not that big a pocket as well ido wish they had like pockets in theside i think that would have reallytaken it over the edge you know umthese are quite baggy on meand i got them in my regular extra smallwhich i mean it's the smallest size so ican't really size down buti still quite like the fit of themanyway and last but certainly not leastigot the matching hoodie to the shortsnow the last time i didn't get thematching hoodiebecause i wasn't sure it was kind oflike what is with this set am i hotor my cold but this time i went for itanywayand i'm glad i did i really love thishoodie i think this is my new favoritehoodiemy favorite thing about this is umit's nice and long on me i'm only 5'3anyway so i can actually get away withthis asmore of a hoodie dress and then becauseit's got cuffson the bottom of them like that materiali can also fold them up and wear themwith the shortsas a set um it's niceand oversized it's got a big massivehood on it noneof that little tiny hood that feels likeyour head isstruggling to get out from under youknow this will cover you upsuper well again i got this in myregular extra small and it was stillpretty oversized so i don't think youneed to size up too much if that's thefit you're looking forbut if you want something a bit moresnug definitely sizedown the season these are alsokind of long i mean they've got thelittle cuffs on butter but i do quitelike that i like but it seems to belonger for the hoodie to be a bit biggerbecause then it feels like you'rewrapped up in a little warm blanket andit's nice and cozyokay so what are my overall thoughts onthe training collectionquite a hidden mess for me i mean theleggingspersonally i wouldn't really stock up onthemfor working out maybe for like like isaidlounging but if you're looking to workout in themyou're gonna have a bit of a difficulttime pulling them up all the time andit's going to getsuper annoying that particular razor barsame thing again wouldn't work out inthemthey won't give you any kind of supportwhatsoever i guess maybe you couldlift them if you wanted to but iwouldn't even be doing that because istill like to have a littlebit of support in some way even when i'mliftingum the

I'm 22 and she's 18 going well Ireally really like her and she saysshe's really into me I've not seen herfor three weeks because I have a bigexam and had studied to do for it andwas away from a week doing doing stuffwith my family since I've come back sheseems distance she seemed distant like Ilike I've not seen her in three weekstried to arrange days where we can meetup even on her days off and she eitherditched me for her friends or she saysshe's too tired she's also taking a longtime to reply to messages or notanswering her phone starts to annoy mebecauseand I'm a pretty patient guy justwondering how should I approach this I'mgetting her space in time I was allright I'm smiling because I already knowwhat we're gonna say somebody's [ __ ]her down oh I've given her space of timebut she hasn't shown much effort to wantto meet up of course in my head I'mthinking there are so many reasons thisis Maine happening mainly because shedoesn't want to see me again but doesn'thave the balls to say anything trying toarrange to see her tomorrow but if shepulls out again I'll confront her beenholding off on doing that since I'veonly been home for just a week youradvice is much appreciated Oh from fromyou bro and Scotland nice WowI love our Scottish brothers wait sowhat were you thinking I was gonna wellhe ended up saying it so I was gonna sayit's gonna come become like a theme forrelationships 101 where you just say youhave to be honest you just have to sitdown communicate like talk to them tothe face and so I was gonna be like heylike do you not want to see me like it'snot worth it just ask her yeah and thenshe'd just be like mate if she's like alittle awkward about it just be like allright she doesn't want to see me I meanif it was like he said even talked toher for three weeks or he just didn'tlike sear in person for three daystalk to him yeah I'm assuming he oh yeahhe hasn't seen her three weeks seniorhe's assuming he's texted her yeah Imean depending on how much you guys talkmaybe she just maybe she thinks you'renot interested in her there's somethingbecause you guys went so long for notseeing each other but she I probably theeasiest thing is just sit down ask hermano a mano what the what the deal isyeah yeah especially if you're sick ifyou're a patient person if you're sayingyou're a patient person and it's stillbothering you then it's got any timejust to like get that that little likethere's like whenever this kind ofsituation is happening like itkind of becomes like all you can thinkabout for a little while that's like whylike what's wrong so once once she Ifeel like what she says like this iswhat's wrong can we fix this or I justdon't want to be with you I'm notinterested yeah that'll just relievethat right don't just let it linger yougot exams and [ __ ] coming up you gotimportant [ __ ] and you left twenty-twoyou probably about to graduate collegeso don't let that linger in your mindnever got to the finals this is fromBethany high hitch it will workfirst-name basis with you so uh I'm 25years old I would say I'm gonna solidseven point five out of tenI lost 130 pounds last year and I'm intofitness congratulations that's awesomemy main interest is gaming bit of a codfan girl I just finished University andI work tooanyways I can't seem to find a manexclamation point I go out to clubs I'msocial I have lots of male friends andpeople who want to hook up for like aone-night thing but no one seems to belong term is gaming unappealing to mendo I need new interests please helpnot for me personally I would that's itone thing I would look for this I meanwe do it like professionally I guess soI would need her to really understandwhere I'm coming from as far as gamingbut no I don't I don't think you wouldneed to change your interest at all Ithink we had something similar to thisbefore we were like no every [ __ ] yeahgames well the thing with that girl islike her guy like didn't want to doanything oh that's what it was all hewanted to do all he wanted to do wasgame right so uh she's she's fromBritain too so I was saying yeahno like um Oh everybody say let's cutthis so maybe go into the club so oftenis part of their I mean the club is funobviously but that's probably what mostpeople are going there for is likeone-night stands hookups they're notreally looking for long-termrelationships maybe change the venuewhere you're looking for guys to me Idon't know where you wouldn't know whatwill be it more serious I don't know I'mreally bad at that because I meteveryone else through like school orwork right oh yeah wait how old 25 soshe's putting nothing not in schoolshe's into fitness though I'd say thatgym is a good place there you go the gymyou know look over no guy if you're a7.5 and you're at the gymno guys gonna like deny you if you'relike hey can you spot me yeah actuallythat's not perfect right I think that'spretty goodask for a spot at the gym I didn't eventhink about yet you're really in thefitness and you're gonna want to findsomebody else that has similar interestto you anyway so start with the gym ifthat doesn't work [ __ ] I don't evenspeed dating maybe it's something that'snot - not the club I don't know it'sdefinitely I mean that's the problemwith the ice dam thing you're having forsure yeah so good luck andcongratulations on the weight lossexactly this is from Joeyhi I met this girl online around 2 yearsago on the omegle of all places do yousay no legal or illegalI say omegle I say legal - that's thefirst time I've ever said Oh big why'dyou say it I don't know anyway we swapnumbers and continue to talk about ayear in I started having feelings forher it took a year to have feelings forher so I told her what an opportunitycame where she made a joke about likingme and I said that I liked her I didn'tget the joke so I told her that I likedher and she didn't have the samefeelingswow that's rocks why would she jokeabout liking you she did it like him andjust deny you were there you know at thetime she did have a boyfriend but that'sno longer the case we still talk and Ijust recently told her I like herand this time she said she does tooour biggest issue is that I live inMichigan and she lives in Las Vegaswe've had Skype dates which is ustalking over Skype all night andwatching Netflix the great thing I loveabout it is how oh and that's great andI love it but how would I move therelationship forward with a 2,000 miledistance you're probably not gonna likethe advice I give I'm gonna say justforget about it yeah I would say thatthere's no way that's ever gonna workhow is it a the Alan our long distancerelationship like it took us an hour tosee each other and that was probably[ __ ] was horrible yeah it was terrible Imean 2,000 mile that's not even likecolossal miles it's not even manageableno less you're just like super rich andcan just like fly there on a private jetwhenever you want anytimeall right so anytime there's ever along-distance relationship there has tobe like a light at the end of the toethere has to be a point in both of youguys's futures where you can see eachother like you can see yourself beingwith each other how long did you say itwas does it he met the girl Auto bagellegal legal and they've been talking fortwo years so he's got to be like 20maybe yeah 21 anywhere from 180 to 21yeah that's that's a tough manCarlos that's all I think I'd say if itwas like a like a hundred percentperfect relationship or friendship orwhatever you guys have then maybe talkabout a future but since she like jokedabout liking you and then it doesn'tseem like it was all too serious in thein the first place unless she's reallythe one and you think that then I wouldsay I would say try to move on I try tofind somebody

boyfriend of two years agotook my virginityabout a month agowait Oh so they've been dating for twoyears and they just recently had sex hisfather is a little bit of a racist anddespises interracial couples so I'massuming they're interracial how theygot away with it for two years is aquestion they were sneaking yeah theywere sneaky when we were getting when wewere getting it in his father walked inand now I'm not allowed over at hishouse oh that's some kinky [ __ ] Oh Godand my parents don't like my boyfriendbecause he's 20 and I'm 17 so I can'tsee him anymore we still text andFaceTime but

parents don't likehim because he's 20 she's 10 she's 17right his parents don't like her becauseone of their two different races andwasn't heard and hid his dad is a racisther parents don't like him because ofhis age because he's yes okay I meanit's three years yeah it's not likethree year difference it's just theweird like 17 to 18 year old range Idon't know if neither you have plansbecause you're still young obviously tohave your own places to live or anythingI would imagine if you want to keepseeing each other you would just have tosneak around on some like Romeo andJuliet type [ __ ] that's good that'sreally what that sounds like which couldbe kind of cool to be honest it soundslike fun I just it's probably a lot ofhassle maybe if you end up going to thecollege that he goes to yeah I would seeeach other if he's it will lives at homeso unless he goes not at school or is itcommuting right so there's a lot ofthings maybe when you go off to ifyou're planning to go to college in ayear then if you guys are still talkingstill sneaking around then you canwell at least have a little bit of likeprivacy well kind of mercy of college isnot very private yeah away from yourparents yes

from DelindaWow this sling we've had a majorityfemales are females this time impressiveyeah so he's either impressive where youguys were really good at faking thegirls stories alright this is fromDelinda hello this is quite a long storyso I'll try to make it a bit shorterit's all going it's all gonna sound verywrong but know that I'm not thebrightest crayon in the Crayola box mysophomore year I moved into my sister'splace she lived with her boyfriend nowfiance and his brother and his ex-wifeall lived in the same all lived in thesame place yeah that is where I met himclinical herb parenthesis of the brotherhe is 29 him and I grew extremely closethe past two years I know things abouthim that he's never told anyone that hecomes to me when he's having issues Ijust turned 18 and he turns 30 in Juneit's a little bit of a different agedifference than the last question I waslike he's doing some grooming we'vekissed quite a bit and we've slepttogether I'm crazy about him but he's alot older and he is friends with myparents so when he comes over it's weirdthat's [ __ ] yeah that's really weirdwe've had girlfriends and boyfriendswhile seeing each otherbefore waned as a parent No I highlydoubt the parents know oh yeah we texteach other every day but he has agirlfriend currently and she doesn'tlike me oh we text every we text everywe text each other every day but he hasa girlfriend currently and she doesn'tlike when he will call me or come see meso he has to do it very secretly andpeople tell me that it's not healthy tohold on to something that will neverwork because we are in different placesin our lives and I need someone else'sopinion on what I should dopulling him from his girlfriend isn'treally a fun thing for me and I care somuch for him I don't know if he feelsthe same he has told me that he loves mea couple times and that he needs me inhis life but the way he is showing itdoesn't make me believe him should I lethim go or wait to see if things willfall togetherasking for a juicy one wait so they'renot dating not dating he has agirlfriend mm-hmm he's 30 she is 18 hisgirlfriend is probably his age yep andhe they both they have both in been inrelationships but they still hooked upwith each other they texts every day theage things throw me off a little bit tobe honest um yeah that's that's a lot ofeight that's a lot of years it's I justimagine like were you guys talkingbefore you were a teen youth it likeshe's 18 now do you think that justsounds like oh she said she just turned18 and he turns 30 in June so yeah theywere definitely talking when she was 17and he was 29 and he was telling herthat he honestly this yeah whateverwhat what kind of got me is when shesaid he he saidlove me a few times yeah I feel like ifhe only says he loves you a few timesand then that's to get something likeeither y'all are about to hook up or hedoesn't want you to date a certainperson or something like thatand he says oh yeah like I love youright he's just trying to tell youwhatever you want to hear so you don'texactly like if you love somebody youlike sale right more than a couple timesyeah so I would say get out of thissituation whatever it is as fast as youpossibly can yeah he's for sure gonnaseem like very charismatic to youobviously because you're 17 eight you'restill like a kid and he's obviously agrown-ass adults oh he's had many morelife experiences and you have he knowsexactly what he's doing I'm sure and itseems like pretty [ __ ] up what he'sdoing yeah pretty sure it could beconsidered illegal gaming people is onlytreasure uh in since he's he's closewith your parents job that to whatever[ __ ] yeah I win honestly if you'rehaving you know second and third fourththoughts about what you should do inthis situation like if you're thatattached to him as a person I would askyour parents about itbecause if they know him and they knowtheir dad might [ __ ] kill him dead ohno I think that would be what it wouldcome to and yeah they might actuallyhurt like if they're he's friends withher parents and they have no ideaand then he's 29 and he hooked up withher when she was 17actually I wouldn't I don't know if Iwould tell your parents or not this islike real advice that we could [ __ ] someI his life up that's just wrongtrue I don't know if I would this isgetting a little advanced legal yeahthis is is a sticky situation lifethreatening advice yeah I woulddefinitely try to get out of thesituation and defuse it as like simplyas possibleto put it into perspective whatever youget out of this situation and you'relike man this really sucks I just wantto talk to this person just know you'regonna get over it in like a year and ahalf max and in the year and a halfyou're gonna be 19 and that's still 11years younger then right like what he isnow so you've got plenty of time to getover it and plenty of time to rerouteyour life in a direction where you thinkit should be go yeah actually you dohave a long time ahead of you just don'tthink this is like the last personthat's ever going to tell you that theylove you or whatever yeah but uh doesshe tell the parents or not it's on onehand it's like I feel like she actuallydoes need to tell somebody because it's[ __ ] up and he has a girlfriend too ohgod this guy's a scumbagno not a person is it dad I said maybeshe does need to just tell somebody yeahthe what if he goes out just does it tosomebody else that's true if you couldcalmly tell your parents maybe maybejust tell it like if it's your mom andyour dad maybe just tell your mombecause she said they hooked up to anydad that I know in that situations goingballistic Oh a hundred percent yeah shesaid they they slept togetheryeah so this will probably be in like anextra this

everybody loves cake um againthey're not healthy cakes but as quackis convenient and if you're notsomething you can be bothered baking ifyou have a key you need to make a veganfriendly and you just don't have time toexperiment with you know black beanbrownie kicks and all these kind ofthingsavocado ganache and all that kind ofstuff then these are easy these arequick and I have actual taste in themoat yet so this video is kind of youknow what hopeful but yet you have threecake mixes I've got them in a stir oneis a chocolate cake one as a chocolatechip cookie and the other one arevanilla cupcakes so three differentthings here and that means if you wereever having a party you can make thesethree things and that would be you sorteat em just have like strawberries andthings on the side but it's just soquick so easy and I am going to show youhow to do okay so the first two thingswe have our they're Betty Crockerdevil's food cake mix bits loopsabsolutely amazing and then we have avanilla cupcake mix is beyond that soyou'll notice it says on the top righthand cornersimply add eggs oil water and Aysenthese things can be replaced wait for itwith fuzzy juice so with the chocolateone we're going to use Diet Coke and forthe vanilla one we're going to uselemonade yes guys apparently this workswe will try and see if it works but theyvidiians themselves and these cake mixesare vegan apart from the sprinkles onthe vanilla cupcake mix so we're justwant to omit them but apart from thatall the uses are vegan friendly and wejust have to add and are busy justrather than

xanthan gum flavored instabilizers salt corn starch that kindof stuff so guys like I said it's nothealthy it's not made to be healthy butby replacing the eggs in the oil withfuzzy juice will actually cut the fat alot and again I don't drink fizzy juiceoften but you know I've had a drinkprocedures ever I hate fuzzy juice butis going to be using a geek andhopefully then it works a um so let's gothe first thing is add your coke at seahundred thirty ml's worth of cork to themix edges whiskerif you want to pour your mixture enterto build these tens I just used veganbutter and then beat according

gonna be like wehave so much equipment becoming and fromwhat we already have it's gonnaliterally be just a badass facility sogym yepyoutoday is day 3 of building the outfitLinux warehouse Jim Tim and I are in au-haul big you own huge u-haul becausewe're headed to get some more gymflooring so further flooring what I'veused since the very first gym I made istractor supply there are four by sixthree quarter-inch mats they'reincredible they're really thick they'restrong and durable and they don't ripbut it's perfect so that's what we usewe already call this morning and theyhave a hundred and eighty of them whichis like more than they've ever had anytime ago so we're gonna buy a hundredand ten more right now at the gym wehave a hundred and two so we're overdoubling the size of the matted squarefootage all right guys we're hereoutside of tractor supply we're in theback these are our mats we've got ahundred and ten of themwe've got the forklift about to loadthem into the u-haul we use the truckone time and a truck can barely holdlike one of these pallets withoutsinking in so you all can hold a lotmore will probably possibly have to maketwo trips depending on how heavy allthis stuff is but each mat costs on theother way each mat is one thirty nineninety nine so forty bucks and we got afive percent discountordering in bulk so that came out toforty five hundred dollars total taxesand everything and I say that not tolike brag by any any means but to I knowa lot of you guys have a passion forfitness a passion for training you mighthave dreams of opening a private gym orpublic gym or doing something with thatthe fitness and I just want to be ableto give you guys accurate expectations Ifeel like that's very importantis that flooring mirrors very expensivevery costly equipment it's a costlything that's but it's all going to workso we're gonna load this up head backI've got a meeting in like 15 minutesso one two three pallets is 75 massreally come backso good good it's a good stuff specialseasoning got a meatlovers normal crustgot a meatlovers thin crust you got twothin crust pepperoni pineapplesso we're about to feast oh but Christianyou're you so

systempull up nicely we got a side that Cybexfunctional cable machine this is reallyreally great very universal so that'severything we picked up come over herewrite down pricing so ah what of thisequipment I think it's like eight piecestotalAustin nine paying right at $6,000everything is very it's it's used goodshape use the stuff last a lifetime so$6,000 equipment we spent 4500 thismorning on mats so again I'm not tryingto like both stir like anything likethat guys are trying to transparent andlet you guys know what really goes intoit a gym is a hard business it's a veryhard business there's a lot a lot a lotof overhead so going into it everythingluckily everything's already paid forall the equipment I've already has paidfor this is all paid for and should besure that you know you're getting intobefore you get into it so I'm reallyexcited we're gonna lay down some matsbut this equipment sort of plan out thelayout and I'll check if you guys knowminute first and foremost is Nikki'splay this not minetaking off I'm gonna get on top of thisStairmaster and show you guys what thegym looks like as of 5 o'clockaerial view all the quim's can getrearranged got got all this for him wedid today they're all the new Clem theycame in that entire sector will be turfprobably that Friday Saturday abouts geta lift in so excited guys are sofreaking excited you know it's so coolthat now we're gonna have a completelyseparate warehouse for athlete athleticsour clothing line and then we're takingthis and we're gonna build somethinggreat build a family feel and at the endof the day like that means so much and Iknow like that's what has put thischannel where it's at and I feel likeit's a wellness a way for me to giveback you know I'm gonna be straight upwith you I know I've talked aboutnumbers a little bit in this video andstuff and here's the thing like this gymis not gonna profit crazy amounts ofmoney it's not like this is not likeespecially we're capping memberships offlike we're not gonna be like these 24hour fitness commercial gyms we'retrying to get 10,000 members and onlyhave like 500 people come in likeeveryone that comes in it's a membershipit's getting get their money's worth wewant them to show up and I think that'sdifferent it's a different businessmodel but at the same time like we'renot doing this to get rich off ofbuilding a public gym like I want to doit to get back and be able to meet youguys and have you come here check it outand enjoy the time here so it's gonna begood alright guys so so much I want totalk to you out here I guess the firstthing is to fill you in on you know whatour exact plans are as far as the publicgym opening up January 1st so so far youguys have seen the actual warehouseyou've seen the layout sort of conceptsideas we have the turf we've got the newsquat racks we've got more than doublethe matting tons of equipment but as faras the offices go we are actually goingto put an athlete retail store inside ofone of our offices and entire retailstores all of our products actuallyslightly discounted than the onlineprices so we can have people come in andactually purchase alpha leet here or themembers can purchase it access new itemswe're also going that we'refront desk sort of like a lounge in thefront we're gonna have two trainers thatare already set and confirmed here atthe warehouse working your full timewith their own clients and everythinglike that and then we're gonna obviouslyhave the public gym open Monday throughSunday every single day we're open we'restill deciding on the hours I'm thinkingMonday Monday through Friday about 6a.m. to 11 p.m. and then weekends I'mthinking like either 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. or9:00 to 9:00 something like that sothat's in the works what else is therewhat else is there I guess I can sort oftouch on the last clip that I talkedabout before the workout footage startedyou know guys there's a lot of money andlike I said earlier in the video I'm nottrying to brag or boast about how muchthis is costing me or anything like thatI want to be transparent with you all Iknow that a lot of you have dreamsaspirations of actually you know eitheryou want to be a personal trainer or youwant to eventually get your own smallspot your own personal training businessyou want to build a public gym so manyof you you know like minded individualslove fitness and want to do somethingwith Fitness with their life and Ifigure what's the point of just likeshowing you the finished product andthen just saying hey this works asopposed to actually showing you you knowthis is what this cost me this is whatthis is costing you know a public allthe equipment guys it's very expensive agym business is a very financiallydifficult business to be honest you haveto pay for your floor you have to payfor the equipment you have to pay forthe mirrors you have to pay employees tobe there and Mike that brings me to mygoal my goal with this is to is not tomake a ton of money it's not a get richscheme to make a you know multimulti-million dollar public gym businessmy goal is to provide something for oursupporters to provide a place where theycan come you know you see me traininghere in every single YouTube video foryou guys to come here visitI'm obviously I'm working out of aseparate office but I'm gonna be comingand training here Nicky will be theentire athlete team will be traininghere and be in this atmosphere and bearound people you know we want membersthat have goals that want more out oflife that are working towardsimprovement and that's we want in thisgym we don't want to let just anyonehere for a nightbucks and just get a thousandmemberships and you know profits moneywe want to have good people here we wantto cap our memberships off so ourmembers feel exclusive and it's such ait's sort of a unique business modelbecause you know obviously we want tobreak evenall right we're accounting on the retailstore to make us you know some decentmoney and break even make some moneyobviously pay the employees andeverything like that but really it'sgonna be a space for something farlarger than the money so we sort ofwe've referred to it as we want to makethis sort of like the you know like thenew mecca I guess you could say the newmecca of the new generation of fitnesswe want to bring everything so I'm so westarted talking about it there's so muchthat's going to happen here there's somany meetups that are gonna happen herewe're gonna bring you all here we'regonna open this up we're gonna have bignames come by here and we're gonna dosome really really big things so superexcited and like I said we've got fiveweeks to do it all so all this planningwe're deciding on membership pricingright now currently we're looking atcapping off at about two hundred andfifty memberships you know totalmemberships which would mean on a normalday we'd probably have about at thebusiest hour I would say 30 to 40 maybe50 people on the floor at one timemeaning you know using the gym at onetime and so that's sort of where we'reat we're thinking pricing we're gonna doabout $39.99 a month or $49.99 a monthand it's difficult because you knowlocally around this area we have youknow 24-hour fitness you have LA Fitnessvery commercial gyms charging 30 to 50dollars that have you know pools andsaunas steam rooms locker rooms thatwhole deal and here you're paying morefor the environment and so it isdifficult to sort of justify highpricing in my opinion but that's whatI'm thinking about thirty nine dollarsor forty nine dollars making theexclusive capping off memberships andreally having the people that want to behere be here so that's the goal sorry ifI'm sort of rambling but that's what I'mthinking guys and there's tons offootage coming soon tons of videoscoming soon and our next launch is goingto be December 13th 2015 it'll be theirlast launch of the year and then we'vegot the LA Fit Expo and then pretty soonsummer shreddingbe starting back up after all that sotons to look forward to I will see youon the next video have it goin lovey'allpeace out",24,UCU1iJ2ChGwaNLvBjip0p2Ag,Christian

"hey zhu bajie one it's Willa Jim sauceand i'm back with the first episode ofthe ironman progress i finally made theaccount we did it we did a live streamfor it it's been pretty sexy but i'lltell you what guys out of every singleseries that I've ever done this has beenthe most like tragic just terribleterrible time making a video um sobasically when I first started thisaccount I did a big stream of it ontwitch and the shreem ended up being 17hours long as well as tons and tons andtons and tons and tons and tons of Clipslike recorded for this video so whathappened was I take my Camtasia recorderand you're able to select the region ofthe screen which it usuallyautomatically just snaps to therunescape client for some reason itwasn't doing it this time I don't knowwhy so you know I just I go in and Idrag it to the 1280 by 720 like how Ialways do it and it starts recording andafter the stream is over after I havelike I don't even know how long it wasit was a bunch of bunch of clips after Ihave all this stuff I go to save it Iopen the video and it's just a blackscreen the entirety the entirety of itwas a black screen I felt so defeatedand so upset with my life and then todaylike right now what I'm trying to recordthis there's a street cleaner that keepson going by but just nothing to clean onthe street nothing happened nothinghappened it's just a normal day therewas no like parade there was no weathernothing it's just it's just air outsidethey're cleaning the air right now and Idon't know maybe it's dirty maybe it'sdirty air that's very possible I I don'tknow but it's just been so hard to makethis video but finally we got it go andI'll tell you what guys I put off makingan Ironman for so long for the solereason of my like my love and need forthe grand exchange like when I made mynew accountfrom scratch it was so much fun becausei knew i was able to make GP somewhatquick and i could access the grandexchange and I could do all these thingsand I knew that I was going to be ableto progress quickly right now the IronMan you don't have the GE and you can'ttrade with it now not that I traded withother people on on my new account ididn't but just being set back like thatand not being able to do these everydaythings that you know normal people cando it's actually kind of fun it'sactually kind of fun so think about itlike this like this is how I've beenthinking about it and this is whatreally is just like getting me you knowif you go on like a normal account likean odd iron man and you want to go do aslayer task what do you do you getgeared up you go get your potions youget your food you get your familiar youget whatever you need and you go and dothat slayer task right now for the IronMan it's a little different okay I can'tgo and buy potions and I can't go in Ican't buy food so what do I have to do Ihave to somehow managed to find GP onthe floor somewhere essentially I got touse that GP to go to a store to buyfeathers or kill chickens for feathersthen I take the feathers and I fish myfood after I spent like numerous amountsof time fishing crayfish so i can do flyfishing then I fly fish for a while toget trout and salmon and then after thatI can't do anything with that because Igotta cook it right you can't eat rawfood so you take the wrong food and thenyou cook it and you burn about 75% of itso so then you go back if you fish againand if you cook again and then youfinally got food and then you canfinally go to the task that you're notreally equipped for because you're aniron man so I'm rolling with like ablack full helm and iron chain body andbronze legs or something and it's justit's just a hassle it's it's a verystrenuous thing but it's a lot of funyou know if if I want to go and I wannaif I want to stream for two hours orsomething let's let's just say i'm doinglike a two hour stream right if i'm on anormal account i'm going in and i can dolike youmultiple task and get multiple thingsdone on the

December 3rd 2015 28 days out from thegrand opening the gym got something toshow you guys some for say hey we gotall this circle for you guys so wehaven't taped it down yet but we alsodecided to put a first section right infront of the logo searching for picturesa lot of color and vibrant so they canbe as long but the funk shows up inthere and Jim's looking good today I'vegot a chest and back workout my manboys first move it hold outwe're gonna go back chest back chestback chest three four back three fourchest 4 to 5 sets / movement startingoff the pulldown that's heavy broso you're on family back to thecompensator if you all I don't have toomuch time but I'm gonna run through thisas quickly as possible as I saidpreviously chest and back workout soback chest back chest back chest sixtotal movements four to five sets perexercise and anywhere from eight to 15sometimes slightly higher reps so thefirst movement was a lat pulldown didfive sets went fairly heavy and I liketo I don't do the same exact amount ofreps every single set for this workoutspecifically I did like to get a few youknew though I was doing the sameexercise a few sets in the lower reprange and a few and the higher so latpulldown then moved on to the inclinedumbbell using the hundred pounds forabout eight to ten and I did three setsof that and then two sets with the 55sfor about fifteen moving on to the niceback movement was a low row a hammerstrength right here it's really nice toget a single arm movement in aunilateral movement I try to do at leastone of those every single back session Isuperset of that with the chestsupported t-bar row as you're seeinghere so I was crunched for time thisworkout I only had about 45 minutes orso and so I wanted to increase theintensity by adding in a few super setsshe any more overall volume in moreexercises in and my heart rate was up itwas an incredible incredible workout sothe next chest movement was inclinedhammer strength as you're seeing herereally focused on pausing at the bottomI feel like a lot of people complainthat they don't feel their chestsactivating or the shoulders take overtheir triceps so I just be sure I amretracting my scapula getting a fourinch motion but most importantly pausingat the very bottom that's when yourchest is stretched and I hold it for asecond and then explode up and contractI superset it the hammer strength with adip on the dips are sort of twodifferent ways to do them if you want tolean forward while you didn't dip it'sgonna help activate a little bit morechest versus being very upright andstrict and straight that's gonnaactivate a little bit more triceps notactively put a little bit more emphasison the tricep the next back movementwhich was the final one was a seatedcable rows two percent with the standingHal pulldown a standing pulldown as youcan see here I'm not sure the exactterminology is just not coming to meright nowbut the final movement was just a PECdeck and that was it I didn't supersetthe PEC deck so thank you guys so muchfor watching there's plenty of goodfootage coming soon so stick around itis a little bit longerlove you guys and I'll talk to you alittle bit lateragainst

tailored towardsgrowing muscle building muscle making mylegs bigger hypertrophy so that shiftI'm really enjoying that shift you knowwe're focusing on the first movementyou're seeing here is a squat press beendoing this every single workout for fiveto six working sets anywhere from 10 to15 reps and progressing so you know alot of people think oh well bodybuildersnever progress they do the same way toall the time but you take that sameprogressive overload that's sort of likethe that stays true no matter what styletraining you're doing you always need tobe progressing you always need to beeither adding weight getting better formcontrolling the weight more or there'sso many different forms of progressiongetting more reps more sets and for meI'm currently working with about sevento eight plates between that 10-15 reprange and you know eventually I want tobe able to do eight plates for five setsof 15 and then I would go to nine platesfor five sets of ten five sets of twelvefive sets of 15 then you know continueprogressing like that guys so smallincrements and doesn't happen overnightbut be sure you're tracking what you'redoing it you don't have to track everysingle exercise you don't have to trackyour you know your last two accessorymovements at the very end your workoutbut I definitely recommend at leasttracking your first few movements yourcompound movement and for me I like todo anywaytwo or three compounds per workout sofocus on those and become better workedall the way up to nine plates so thiswas the this was the fifth set for nineplate or four with nine plates

Aeon family if you were watching thisvideo out of nowhere the exercise thatyou're about to see you know thecombination of them might look a littlebit weird a little bit random and trustme I'll explain in just a few minutes onthe second commentary this video but I'mshooting to talk about right now theexercises that I'm doing and tips onthem so start it off this entire workoutwith the incline dumbbell press reallyfocusing on my upper chest right now anda few tips here capulet tracted archingthe lower back but always always alwayson the bench do not let your butt riseand stay on your feet you see your feetare planted butts on the bench gap itwas retracted and there's a slight archnext movement and we think I did exactlyfive sets of ten to twelve I want to sayten reps five sets of ten with the 85pound dumbbells moved on to a squatpress pretty much alike press thisspecific piece of equipment is Technicall the squat press so on this I like toput my feet a little bit lower I wastrying to emphasize my quads during thisworkout so I put my feet lower slightlycloser so a narrow low stance to helpemphasize my quads if you want to go alittle bit wider go a little bit higherto emphasize a little bit morehamstrings so really just focusing onthe quads like I said so next movementis a bicep movement so as you see chestquad and bicep what the hell is going onI'll talk about it in a little bit Ipromise but here really focusing onkeeping proper form not letting my backpast perpendicular so meaning you knowthe floor and myself are the angles Idon't want to let my back go past thatperpendicular line and lean backwardsand risk injuries so also flex thetricep at the bottom of the movementnext movement was a cable fly right herefocusing on bringing my pinkies togetherso not keeping a huge bend my arms avery very slight Bend and bringing mypinkies together and sort of supinatingmy wrist just very very slightly ever soslightly to get a better contraction inmy chest next was a quad extension hereyou know very basic movement I like toalways be sure that my knees are equalwith the end of the seat and so I don'tlike my knees being over or I guessunder the seat I like to be sure that myknees are exactly where the seat endsand also I point my toes upwards as I'mperforming the movementat all times - pointing forward and upnow final movement of the day was areverse curl with the cables putting mythumb's over the bar and focusing onsqueezing and engaging my brachialisricky-ricky radio house and that was theworkout so I will talk to y'all in justa bit and not confuse you so muchthis is grandma's dog chihuahua puppythe smallest puppy you probably everfind maybe this isit's now about 10:00 p.m. Sunday nightabout to head to bed knock obviouslywatching TV shows but anyway what I'vebeen doing every single night for thelast few months I would say is having aprotein shake every night before I go tobed simply to ensure in the surplus ofmy protein intake so what I've beendoing is Dymatize iso100 you can see wemight have I don't have like one morescoop left maybe one more scoop so I hadto restock todayso Daniel Charlie and I went to asupplement store total nutrition mybuddy Mike actually owns the totalnutrition so you think in me discount onsome products now keep in mind guys likea lot of people a lot of youtubers andstuff like I want to sponsor this it'sAmelie and use this stuff but you knowI've worked with a few companies in thepast I currently am working with acompany but just as I'm working withsomeone doesn't mean take other thingsand try other things and so I feel likethat's just another part of beingtransparent I love trying new preworkouts new products protein powdersand finding what I like the most and soand I have no shame I like saying thatso Nikki wants to the me knows so wepicked up the GAT strawberry Kiwi wasn'tcrazy about him right yeah I thoughtthat tasted okay I'm not a big amino guyunless I'm gonna cut or you

be the dumbbellsections like what you're seeingunnhhh added its muted um no sectionupdatethat's a dumbbell section 1 2 3 4 4 X 2sets of dumbbells there's one setthere's two sits from right here on thisway will be the whole dumbbell sectorall right family back to anothercommentary whew all and now have alittle bit longer to talk I can take mytime and explain what I'm doing with mysplit so for the last literally guysyear and a half two maybe even two and ahalf years I've been following avariation of the push-pull leg push fullleg pull legs push you know legs pushpull some sort of combination of that inevery few months I'll change it up andthrow an arm and shoulder day in but tobe honest I'm getting kind of bored ofthat same thing and so what I'm tryingout now I'm not committing to the splitand this is very it's like a rough draftextremely rough draft it's like therough draft that you do you know 20minutes before classes do it just toturn something in I'm attempting a lowervolume higher frequency so instead oftraining every body part one to twotimes a week I want to try in every bodypart two to three times a week and youknow three three times a week would bemy lagging body parts so my back I wantto bring up and my legs I really want tobring out my back and legs or my focus Ihave a few months left in this bulk andI'm trying to make the most out of themand so essentially what I'm doingfor example today I hit back shouldersand biceps so I picked three body partsback shoulders and biceps I did threemovements for back three four shouldersand two for biceps if you went back toyou know the beginning in this video Iactually chose chest biceps and chestbiceps and quads okay so there were somelegs in there now sort of my idea goinginto it I know Lex Griffin doessomething sort of similar I haven'ttalked to him about it but I know he hedoes something somebody'll throw like ahamstring or quad or you know calves inthere and the purpose behind it for meis at least the reasoning I'm seeing asa point it would be say taking chestbiceps and quad your chest is fresh youcan devote a lot of time energy to ityour biceps are fresh because you're notinvolving your biceps yes it's like athird dairy muscle or your it's not asecondary muscle but you're using yourbiceps when you're doing any sort ofbenching yes but it's so slightly thatyour biceps will still be fresh when youdecide to perform them and thenobviously your hamstrings your quads arestill gonna be fresh because you've onlytrained two upper body movements now theway you organize those is or the way I'morganizing them is sort of based off ofme sauce yes I'll start with one chestmovement but then I'll perform a quadand then I'll do a bicep and you knowmess around with it and find what I likethe best and not to say I'm always gonnawork antagonist like today I did backand biceps and antagonist back intriceps so I did back in biceps a like Isaid I'm playing with it and my goal isto be able to train each body but reallyjust train my back and my legs myhamstring my quad and my calves threetimes a week as opposed to two times aweek and have more energydevoted to actually work in the muscleroom trying to work instead of trying tosqueeze seven eight leg exercises in oneday and kind of half-assing a fasting anactor you know the first two or threeexercises and you know exhausting myselfso much so that is the mentality that'ssort of that's where my thoughts are atright now as soon as I finalizesomething I'm gonna be shown my workoutsand messing around with it but as soonas I finalize something I will doanother commentary I'll do a full videoor like a little video series of thesplit that I choose to go with and thebiggest thing about splits guys is youhave to enjoy your time in theif you're not enjoying the workouts ifyou're not enjoying how your workoutsare laid out you know you're only asefficient as much as you can actuallyenjoy the time that you're putting in soenjoying the time is literally overbeing slightly you know one and a halfpercent more optimal gain to me at leastbecause if I enjoy what I'm doing I putmore effort into it and get betterresults and I would say the same for youall so thank you for joining me on thiscommentary I hope you enjoyed this videoand enjoy this last little clip scaredalright guys so just working outI hear Nicki just like yell and turnaround all give me the new mirrors justlike came down hard that one shatteredand they no one even touched him no onewas touching him at all they justliterally as I came down hard god I wasscared yep so on that note that's howyou can through this video next videowe'll see what we do about these yearsAccio,17,UCYJRErS0NXmcqlS_1EnUTnw,angel raesqui,0,0,0,0,No

see if you'rewatching if you have a good to come outlike that but from what I've got of PPSnutrition watch over for their flavorsare actually really quite nice the faceof pure Pro II blend it's not a blondeBrent blend is actually really niceflavor so the flavor I'm going to checkout for each day is the banana splitflavor their colossal pro 90 hard copygoose intrusion and banana split flavorwithout a flavored stuff I usuallyactually eat at the eat usually actuallyhave my protein has banana flavor orvanilla and so he's quite hopeful Anakinissues so it will be quite good too Imean I all compare this with nativewedding in cooperative because that'swhat I usecompare the flavor of a strap look soinitial I smell of sewage travel withsmells of bananas it's rather bananasit's banana flavor it's a good start soso don't put pieces so I'm opposite mixit all themselves it's obviously a 200am I mix my proteins I've seen the farthat makes it the like 200 mil walks onthe climb up with Warren so 200milliwatt a free food free gram proteinpowder put it in there and then just tryit out so the lid so before I roll onthat's awful explosion ecopia not truemix up I must try up on really yellowquite quick actually guessing not to seewith a lot of different person I specialops them up yeah cook check and likethat turn your middle block I guess itwould be quite a fig shake as usual justbecause obviously not really using muchwater the color of it really yellow I'min the bright yellow but if it comes topick mine up quite good but reallybright yellow color real nice out so itlooks like Madonna should do look soworkout in itself a chick that's reallyreally strong finally every day the dareyou actually the day smell-o-vision isremembered you can age from race Monzaprotein powder that's what I

I'm headed to the CG fitnessheadquarters got my protein shake righthere this is gonna be my pre-workoutmeal it's about a scoop and a half ofthe cellular protein and it's actuallyTim's birthday so we're gonna go hitsome legs and him and I talked lastnight about recently been we've beenkind of thrown off both this one'spretty thrown off before our workoutshaven't been having good workouts Ihaven't really been mentally focused sowhat we're gonna be doing is startingtoday we're turning our phones oncomplete airplane mode you know noexcuses just complete airplane mode fromthe second we're like ready startworking out until the second we're doneand we've been getting sort of trackedyou know whether it be like an email orcustomer service or or you know a phonecall or even just like social media it'sso easy to distract from what you'reactually in the chip to do and for meyou know I'm not just working at myhouse so you know focusing on recordingobviously and getting good footage aswell but I'm letting that just remindfolks and try not to get distracted andI feel like the only way to do that letme shut myself off for like a solid hourand a half a day so that begins todayit's a challenge for myself and Iencourage you all to do the same or atleast try to do the same it's a promisepre-workout drinkaka human half protein to get somethingmy system and then we're gonna kill somelegsairplane motors on we get up ready forbattlelet's do it working with 330 pounds shehas been following for the last you knowa few months you know that legs havebeen my number one priority you knowbringing up my legs hitting him strongergrowing my legs and I've been doing alot of squats in focusing on my formperfectamente form my head neutral allyou know not dealing with foot alignmentall these things I've been working onand if you've also noticed that over thelast few months 315 has kind of beenlike my my limit that's been the weightthat I've chosen to work with you knowfour sets of three you know a few weeksago I hit five six two three with 315about I don't know we can have two weeksago I hit we've seen four 5x5 and todayI was the first day I finally decided tokind of add weight on to what I thoughtwas kind of like gonna be my workingweight for a while so 330 pounds goingfor three sets of three reps and it feltreally really good I felt you knowobviously was heavy but I completed allthree sets of three with you know decentnow I mean not not even decent I wasvery happy with my form even when I wasgrinding I feel like I wasn't roundingmy back I was eating my back tight I waskeeping my head neutral and I justoverall pleased with this workout soafter the three sets of three droppedthe weight down of course I'm you knowmy goal is not to be a power of threeguys I'm not going for a 1 rep max but Ido want to get stronger I do want to endup working with heavier weights and soafter the 3 by 3 I did three sets of 240pounds which you're gonna see after thisfor about sets of 10 so getting a lot ofvolume in on the squats and that's it soI'm very happy with the progress I'mgonna be trying a 5 a 5 by 3 very verysoon on the squat followed by probablythree working sets of about 10 to 12 soanytime I'm doing low rep work Itypically will follow that with a fewsets of the same movement so you knowsquats being the main compound or alittle bit higher rep get more volume inso that's gonna cool its commentarythank you guys for watching enjoy therest of the video have some pretty goodtips in my opinion some upper body tipscoming in the next few clips and I'lltalk to you on the next oneour guys were headed to struggle in itnow my mom is starting to she made it agoal to really take care of her a littlebit stronger get back in the gym just todo a lot of running and so she wants toget back into that so I'm hooking her upwith some protein I'm gonna get her astrawberry encuesta vanilla just get herprotein intake up just a little bit andthis isn't a good daythat's it here's some stuff I'll takeyou all through with you it's the road Iguess we're on our second working sethere our first movement which is anincline dumbbell rock my new rise wristrest this is a military addition link isin description rise gym gear.com and thefirst set we went 70 front dumbbell 6lonow we're gonna bump it up to the 80s gofor about 10 so here we golet's go so what's the next stepgood one 1210 removal by 8 reps luckmost likely the 92nd ammo clip for lastset so I'm gonna give you one real quicktip on these dumbbell side laterals it'sjust for the standard dude you're like acable side lateral or the machine sidewhy don't you probably after this butyou're only going to show you guys so Ijust have one to demonstrate now whenyou're going up a lot of times peoplejust swing it like this swing like thisbut a way to kind of activate yourshoulder a little bit more try to thinkwhen you're coming up pull through yourelbow so I'm here if you're focusingmentally I'm pulling your elbow up youwant to think that so don't think putyour arm up think pulling your elbow upeyes are coming up so on it's hard todemonstrate it's almost like a mentalthing it's a mental cue for you

trying to get like the websiteone of the left selling pictures rightnow we're gonna do this blue on thiswall I think it'll get some nicecontrastalright guys so mid-workout feelingreally really good so kind of particularmy posing here and then I'm gonna keepworking on it especially after theworkouts done but this morning I gotinvited to go to the branch warrantwhich is a competition here in Houstonactually it was about 25 30 minutes downthe road to go you know check out thecompetition see the men's physique go onis my shows next week so sort of get anidea below us and a half and everythingand I decided against it against goingwell you know it does make sense to goand kind of I don't know know what toexpect but my reasoning behind not goingwas there's me a lot of I didn't wantanything to get inside of my head thislast week you know it's not about youshouldn't go and competing you knowtrying to see oh can't beat this guy canit be disappearing I maybe if I competehere I can win this class it's like youshould want to focus on yourself and ifyou go and see like you know if youthink everyone looks that crap on stageoh I usually got that but then you couldalso go and you know see guys are 20pounds heavier than you more shreddedmore conditioned and it could psych youknow they can mess with your head and soI thought that staying here focusing onwork recording getting an outfit websiteand focusing on my workouts or cardio mymacros like that's gonna that's to methat's more important than going toscope out competition or wonder who'scompeting or whop-ting it's everything because it allcomes down to you and in the last 11 12weeks I've been doing everything youknow on my own just like anyone duringprep so it's like why just go in scareyourself or get worried or stressed outjust keep doing you and I feel like thatapplies to everything in life not justin competing but focused on you therewas a quote I was reading today I wantedto post it right pose it the grass I'mtoo busy working on my own grass doesn'tmetaphor to notice that the otherperson's grass is greener so be sofocused on you and building yourself andbuilding your business and yourcharacter and relationships that youdon't even you know you don't care ifanyone else is doing better than youyou're focusing on you're putting yourtime theredon't put time into being concernedabout what other people are doing andthinking and what their their opinionsfocus on what you're doing ascompetition wise business wiserelationship wise take care of yourresponsibilities and if you give yourfull attention here everything seemed topay off if you start if you're givingyour attention here but you're noticingthis and you want to get involved inthis and this and this you're going tospread yourself too thin and I thinkthat's really really important I thinkthat's something that has gotten me towhere I am todayis focusing on yourself not thenegativity and the distractions thatlife bringsthat was a tangent out of the house thatkind of went over here what you're doingbroke I am reading my YouTube commentsso I read all of my comments guys and Icame across a really funny one Alejandrosays people in

hello hello youtube um my name is sarahand my first video today i thought iwouldshow you um a few bits i've bought fromgymsharkuh from their new collection umthe items i saw on their recently whichi thinkcame out in february so i picked up acar show the whole collectionbecause that would be crazy money for meto buy all of them although i did likelots of the different colors that theyhad on there the summer especiallyi'm five two and a half to threealways that half that gets everyone umand alsoum exercise wise i tend to dojogging so at the moment i'm sort offinishing couch to 5k for the secondtimein a row um i'm halfway through that soi'm doing joggingmostly i need gym wear that can likei can move in easily and an absolutemust for me is it has to be high-waistedso they are kind of things i use it forum and what i need for my exercise gearplus i like to have nice colors i hatewearing blackgenerally so i need nice upliftingcolorsstuff that's going to make me want towear my gym clothes and get me motivatedto exercise as well so i have a fewthings from gymshark alreadyso i thought i could compare maybe acouple of thingsi bought in this hall with what i'vealready got i think just to start withmaybe i'll just tell you what i'vealready got on so i have thispink cropped t-shirtum says gymshark on it on one of thesidesand it's just it curves at the sideand dips at the back and at the frontit's really nice cropped and it fitsreally well with likemeats like leggings really nicelynow these leggings are theum vitalseamless leggings yes the original onesthough not the newnumber twos pair of those i've got in myhaulso these are the original ones these arein a brown colornow they have a high-waisted bandi always get all of my stuff in a smalleverything always in the small i'm abouta uksize eight uh both top and bottomso reference so it has a high waistbandwhich i like but i likely it's not toovisiblei'm not that keen on the waistbandswhere it has big letteringbecause i feel like it draws attentionto the areaum the band is quite smoothon the back ribbing the band has gotlike a ribbingeffect and thenthe bottom now they're a bitum it's only a bit long for me butactually i don't mind because whenyou're in trainersyou can tuck them in do your trainersthe endsbut i am five two and a half so i thinkfor any normal sized person theywouldn't be longum these are a full length now they havelike a slight ribbingat the bottom um of the leggingand then the rest of it's just kind ofall smooth basicallythere are no pockets on the vitalseamless leggingsbut i think the main thing i like aboutthese are that they're full lengthum and just very like simpleand also like the colors i've onlyactually only gotbut she only got one pair of these so idid want to trysome more of these ones the brown goesreally nice for the pink it goes niceand mint it goes nice and blueit actually goes really nicely with alot of colors sothe brown is kind of like a black for meokay so theseare new vital seamlessleggings but number two so from thesecond rangeso as you can seethey're actually full length umthis is a first impression so literallyi don't think so on these ones comparedto the brown ones i've got onthere's a logo on the back of the legor by the ankle which is not which i'mlike fine with i don't mind that at alland the cuffs are actually likethere's like a proper cuff there at thebottom so there's like a stitch in hereand the waistband is very much the sameas the ones i've got onin terms of high-waisted and like not anoverly visible waistband which i likethese are in the light blue color nowthey did have them in a really beautifulyellowand a black was there any othersi think that was it oh no and the taupethe taupenow i don't have the taupe ones but ihave got another topi'll show you in a bit that is kind ofthe taupe grayi think color very similar anyway soyou'll getto see the idea of the colorum and then you just got the logo at thefrontso yeah they seem very similar solet's try them on umin a moment and see what we think umi'm going to get a top to put on withthem so you can see what they look likebut next let's trya sports cloth i don't really need anymore sports bras i'm not gonna liebut because it was in this reallybeautiful blue colori really had to get it i'm obsessed withblueas you'll see mostly to be honest all ofthis haul is and blue stuff pretty muchapart from one itemsothis umis a light blue color it's coming upmoreit's coming out light blue on the camerabut it's coming up more brighterit's actually say slightly more babybluein real life um thisis a low support bra so idon't particularly need ummuch support to be honest and these havethe paddingremovable padding so you can remove theminside of the back there which is greatand this gym sharp glue gun the frontis what i really like is it's like thiskind of siliconeyfeel which is quiet pleasant to touchum this is very small detail reallynow like the othersi have a feeling thisi can't remember exactly which rangethis is wrong but i do have another brafrom gymshark that's very much like thiswhereso you can see it's got a really nicecross backthere lovely cross backwhich can i just say it can getconfusing when you're trying to just putit on because you're working out whereto put your armsum with a cross shape but maybe that'sjust mebut anyway there's two layers what iwant to sayso there'skind of that's the joined but there'slike two layers hereand so you've got the bra there it'salmost likea top on top of a bra so crop top on topof a braso it's a double layeredbrush basically but it's an all-in-onewhich is quite niceum i have got one like thatfrom so i already have thisalthough it's slightly actually the backslightly different it'sit's from thevital rise vital rise i thinkback to rise collection again but it'slike top see this is where it getsconfusing for meit's like a top and a bra at onceugh let's saytoo confusing bra here and then this isthe top down herebut again they're joined so they've donea simple thing here with a vitalseamlessbra so yeah i'll show you that um in asecond withthe umvital seamless leggings which now saythey're not the same blueuh the this is more like umthe leggings are more of acornflower blue i guess and then this ismore like a proper lightbaby blue sports bra but i still thinkthey would go really nice togetherokay i'm back so i'm gonna show youum so these are leggingsvery similar in terms ofthe waistband umi mean they're so flattering all of theleggingsand this is the back these don't haveany pocketsum in these leggings i think the onlyones i haveleggings wise from gym shark that arehave a pocket are the vital rise oneswhich areso it has like this pocket on the sideat the back on the waistbandit's i think it goes really well withthe sports bra um[Music]now i'd say these are pretty along formeum if you can tell butthey're quite bunched up at the bottomso if you're kind ofmy height five foot two to maybe fivethreefour they'll probably be slightly a bittoo long but maybe if you're a bitum taller that'd be fine one thing inoticed actuallywas like the stitching on the inside legis reallyyou can see like a reallysort of like line the stitchinglike a blue color which is quite niceextra detail so yeah overalli really like it now brow wiseit was actually fine to get on it wasn'ttoo complicatedum it'syeah the paddings things are annoyingwhen you put them in a washas you know you will say umbecause obviously just keep moving youhave to keep readjusting themso i don't know if i'd keep them butthey're handyto start with i guess um what i reallylove about itis the detail at the backi'll have the tagyou see that's really niceum it's really nice especially in thesummer whenyou're wearing a vest top and you canactually see the detail obviously othersin the winterwhen i'm running i'm just wearing a longsleeve soto be honest like no one's gonna seethat detail butit's not it's a really nice like umdetail to have andi really like that they come down quitefar like in terms oflike meats you only got a little bit ofskin leftto [ __ ] on show once you've gothigh-waisted leggings onyou can see it comes down um and lowon the sideso yeah overall i think this is a reallynice actuallyreally lovely for um spring and summerum especiallyso the next item i've got to showis thisum tank topnow i think it's like showing up a bitdarker than what it actually isin real life um but it'sa light blue it's actuallyin between both the sports bra and theleggingsin terms of um colorand it just says gymshark at the frontjust turn around guys umso as you can might be able to see thecolor betteron there and i'm gonna just try this soi got this in a small now this is fromthe fiti think this is a fit rangei'll leave links below and umi think the thing i love most about thisis how soft it isit's so soft andit really meets at a really nice lengthactually especially as i'm sure like idon't think sliding is too longbut it's really flatteringas well look back it's like a drop downthere but it's not an exaggerated hemand at the top it's like nice necklineat the side it's like a dropped slightlydropped handbut not too baggy that when you're likeum kind of doing you know like you'redoing hit workout and you'rei don't know like doing bicycle umkind of exercise moves and you you knowyou're leading forwardit's not going to like really leanforward basically and startlike sagging too much at some of thebest stops i've triedalike so yeah i really like thisactually umit's a really nice color but it's notfrom a new range but it just goes reallynicely withthe leggings next thing i've got isum something from the adapt the newadapter rangei'm just trying to find in the bagoh my words this color is absolutelybeautifulit's turquoise color now the reason igot these actuallyis um because i have a very similarcolored pair from nike which i've hadfor yearsand i absolutely love um it's not quitean animal printas these areexcuse the nails guys it's locked downlifeum but yeah i have a similar pair fromnike and i actually love thembut the waistband has gone loose whichis just so annoyingand that's one thing i'd say i haven'tnoticed from gymshark so theirwaistbands don't gosaggy which my like ones have so ireally want toreplace those with thesenow these arefrom what i can tell a full lengthleg in um again like all of my otherleggings high-waistedhave to buy high-waisted i can't buyanything elseso they have a very toy soundvery similar to the seamless twoi guess and then you just got the gymsharkthereso they're kind of ripped all the waydown actuallyand they're very stretchy but yeah theykind of ripped all the way downa very subtle ribbon i think it justhelps as a stretch again you've gotcuffs at the bottom as wellsnow pockets on these ones eitherthese really remind me ofi think they're likethey're very much like the vitalseamless to be honesti'm not quite sure the only differencefor meis literally the fact that there's a gymshark down the side on one layerand then on the vat of seamless you'vegot the actual logo hereso literally that's the only differencethat's literally the only differenceso i'll give those a try see what ithink of thoseand the last item kind of really needlong-sleeve track topsto go over my vests and t-shirts andthings like thatand i have a couple from nike whichobviously love which were quiteexpensiveabout 50 pounds yeah 50 pounds i boughtthem years agoand they have really lasted and but youknow i've only gota couple of them so i needed a new oneso i saw this one on the gym track nowthe ones on gym trucks sell out reallyquickly that's one thing i will say isaw loads of colors different ones ilikebut um yeah this is the only one i couldget my hands onso it's from the it's from the vitalseamless collection actuallyand it's a lovely taupe color andit's a half zip sothe zip goes down to the top of yourstomachum it's like a high neck which is nicethis taupe color i think is what theyhave inlike the other version of these blueleggings i have on nowum and then at the back it's got a logothere so and thenit's a very soft material actually andit is ataupe mall so that's what i think ishould say it's like it's got thateffect mild effectlike a lot of this stuff hasn't actuallythe blue leggings i've got on i've alsogot that effect as welland thesleeves are rippedfrom about there they're rippedand they've got the holes the fingerholesas well just get in the winterand yeah it's ribbed on the on the bandlike at the bottom as wellwhich is useful so yeah i'm gonna givethat a go nowi'm back now i've got this long sleevetop onnow one thing i didn't realize was onthe dribble sharklike long sleeves the handsgo on the little finger rather than onthe first thing or the thumb but that'sfine feels a bit weirdat first um yeah i really likeneck andzip and it's really softthe only thing is it's quite long likeyou can stretch it down really long butto be honest when you're runninglike this will just go really up hereanyway soi think it's just it just means there'sa lot of bunching up butyou get that with a lot of these longzips anyway it does actually slightlysort of like drop down as a dropped headat the back slightly as well which isquite a nice detailum but this is realistically how it willend upworking on me to be honest umso yeah like it andso these are the adaptleggings animal leggings umagain i haven't pulled them up properlythey can go so high-waistedum i've seen less bunching with theseactually than some of the othersso they're incredibly high-waistedwhich is great there are no pockets justrippinghere and actually the cuffsand shoulder cuffsso yeah not too much punching once i'vepulled them out properlyand yeah here's what they look likeon the sideso yeah like not much to say abouttoo much about the vital the adapt sorryanimal leggingsone thing i'd say is they're moreexpensive thanum the other leggings i haveso these the only price i rememberactually from this haul wasthe adapter animal leggings were 50poundswhereas some of the other ones i havearound 40 45 maybeso anything i will say this is likethey probably feel lighter weight towear soa lot stretchier than even the vitalseamlessi think because i've got pretty much gotthis ribbing all the way downin fact um but 50 pounds a lot of moneyto payfor a pair of leggings so just comparingthemthese adapt to the vital seamless ithink definitely likethese adapt ones have ribbon all the waydowni think that's what makes them reallyfeel really lightweightand stretchy right as the vital seamlessare literallylike there is no ribbing well there isrippingbut only down the second half of the legactuallyum so that's clearly what you're payingthe price for is that extra stretchin the leggings but the design is alsoreally nice as wellthey do the sports bra and the adapteranimal they do it in thisturquoise green color that i've got onthey also do it in a greywhich is really nice i have seen it thisis not the first adapter animalrange they've done so they have actuallydone other colors as well which i'veseen some really nice colorsof ocean pinks and greens other greenssoi definitely want to maybe invest in acouple of thosebut i think these leggings are the firstones or 50 poundso but what i'll do is i'll put all thedetails in the description box belowthat link so you can check out kind ofthe details of themand the pricing and for all of the itemsi've boughtthat is literally everything i've boughttoday so comment below likewhat your kind of favorite um brand forsportswear is and kind of your favoriteitemsum or if there's any items that you wantbrands to kind of do um great in thefuturethat you don't already think isavailable so yeah hopefully you likethisand see you next time bye,24,UC3kbAe8BguiZFnsVYY1oW0w,Steve

here's the gym it is November 10th 2014got Nicky rockin the new tank top let'sshow it to himboom CG Fitness with the Razorback backand we're about to go inoh [ __ ] yes I see me right now I havelike you see me in the reflection I'vegot like an entire tripod that I'mholding this from but I'm about to gokill a chest and tricep workout withNathan so starting out some inclinebarbell I believe PR for the last likesix weeks or four weeks is 235 for 8reps as a max effort set last time I waslike 169 and I hit 270 or 235 for sevenreps so we're going to try to get eightfor this workout here we goalright let's hear on family back thechest and tricep workout for you all Ican to take you through everything so Iwarmed up with two sets of just the barmoved up to 135 for 8 to 10 then 185 andthen to 25 and I'm not trying to tiremyself out while I'm warming up guysthat's why I kind of notice as Iincrease the weight on my warm-up setsI'm decreasing the reps here I'm onlydoing like what 5 or 6 reps and thenwith 225 I only do two reps just so Ican get a feel to weight and work my wayup to my heavier working sets but hereyou're about to see is the thumbnail ofthis video and also an Instagram picturethat I posted about two days ago we wereworking out Nathan you showed us thismeme on Instagram music hey you guysshould like remake this Instagrampicture really alright yeah let's do itso increase the testosterone levels by250% and how to increase your benchpress but yeah just super positive 225and we showed you a false on Instagramat Christian use on Fitness and also atNicki black Euler and here is the firstworking set of the workout so as you sawin the very first clip going for eighttotal reps and here you're going to seeis I fail on that a threat but right nowthe body weight is right at 168 169 whenI did hit those eight reps I was about173 to 174 and here you can see as thereps 1 through 6 the bar speed is veryvery fast and at 7 I started readjustingmy grip because I felt like I grabbedtoo close so my grip was too narrow formy liking I should have gone wider Idon't know why I want that narrow but Idecided to try to gangsta kind of pissedme off how I didn't I feel like I failedbecause of my grip and just beingoff-center but I widen up the grip alittle bit and I think I even want towiden it a little bit more if you guyscan see my pinky fingers about 1 inchfrom that ring so I want to be with mypinkies right at that ring for the nexttime I do the barbell but here I hit 7reps so I ended up hitting 235 for twosets of seven which I was very happywith versus just 235 for one set ofeight and then dropping the weight downI think that I'm getting more more totalvolume more total workload with theheavier weight doing two sets of sevenso very happy with that here justshowing the arms leaning out a littlebit like I said earlierweighing in between 168 and 167 todaywhich is November 12th that you'rewatching this is officially four weeksand one day into my diet so just passedup four weeks and I'm right at about 1.1to 1.2 pounds loss this week droppinganywhere from 1 to 1.5 pounds everysingle week for the last 4 weeks and Iwant to continue at that pace I feellike it's not too drastic where I'm notsacrificing much strength through muchmuscle and it's still nice pace fromseeing results slow and steady so gonnakeep it up and I can't wait to see whatmy physique will bring in a probablylike I would say six more weeks wouldprobably conclude the scut and then havea little maintenance then really dial itin for the Expos maintenance slashprobably should maintain for a few weeksand then go into that really digging forthose lower numbers of body fat andnothing too crazy I don't want to benecessarily stage ready but I want to bewhat you consider maybe like four orfive weeks out from a competition andjust kind of try to maintain that lookas opposed to diving down and trying todo a show or something like that but Imoved on to some flat dumbbell bench andI haven't in dumbbell in a very longtimeI feel like this workout we did a lot ofvolume on that incline bar but I thinkwe did like five or six working sets soinstead of doing incline dumbbell wantto go and do some flat just to make surethat my you know everything is still incheck performs in check my strength ofthis and check and everything so did oneset of 90s and dropped it down to 75sore set to 10 to 12 and here's Nathandoing them and the workouts are feelingreally good you guys I feel like becauseI'm leaning out it's like you knowseeing the results in the mirror youalmost get motivated during the workoutsand you know a better worker Ipersonally had better workouts you knowyou would think that dropping mycalories dropping my carbs a little bitwould affect my you know mentality andmy lifts and stuff but right now so farfour weeks in I just feel better thanever better than I have in the lastfrickin six to seven months um so yeahRahman gym shark as all these guys thegym shark link is in the description ifyou use that link in Guzman 10 it savesyou 10% off any gym shark item but uhthis is probably like I love these luxetanks that they're not like a new itemthey're a little bitholder of an item but Ursula how theyfit so chest flys doing 4 sets of 10 to15 depending on the set I like to staycloser to that 10 to 12 rep range butsometimes if I feel like I can grind outanother 2 or 3 reps then I'll do it andI'll like increase their weight the nextset to be sure I'm staying in that reprange tricep doing some skull crushersand then overhead French press with theEZ bar I really always incorporate atleast one to two overhead movements formy tricepsI feel like focusing on that long hand alittle bit more than the lateral andmedial head which is what any overheadmovement does has really contributed tomy growth of my tricep so that's why Ilike to always do them I'm not a hugefan of like cable kickbacks or CloseGripcloser of bench press but I do lovethese overhead movements and going asheavy as I can and getting a deepstretch so that's going to include thiscommentary and I hope you enjoy the restof this blog Christianese my calm 12p.m. on

us all right guys sowe just recorded or attempted to recordan Instagram video with a three-quartersleeves so this is what judge is kind ofmessing with it this isn't the finalproduct 1cg is not enough so you havethree CGS and so we're gonna play thefinal product for you guysthree I'm committing Joe to doing ittonight what if I can't in three twoI want to thank Joe for that incrediblein-stream video is definitely one of myfavorites yet and moving on to thisworkout salmon it's sort of fill youguys in give you an update talk aboutthis back and bicep workout my trainingstyle tips and we're going to jump rightinto it so started off this workout withlat pull-downs and lat pull-downs ourmovement that I'm sure you know 90 to95% of us incorporate in our routinesweekly it's an amazing movement I'vebeen doing it for years and years sinceI was my phoneand after experimenting with differentgrips you know I've gone I've done weeksand months where I go very wide I'vedone a narrow grip I think that myfavorite grip of all time to get themost bang for your buck the mostengagement out of the lats is goingslightly wider than neutral grip so ifyour shoulder width and they go aboutinch and a half two inches wider rightwhere the bar starts to groove I like toput my hands there put the thumb overthe bar as a hook grip and use my handmy hands as hooks and just pull downwith my elbow and that's how I get themost out of that movement so that's mypersonal favourite not saying that'sright for every single person but messaround with it and see what you feel themost see that you enjoy the most andstick with it so after the pulldown suitonto some barbell rows here you can seetrying to keep my back straight my neckneutral and I use 225 for a few sets anddropped it down to 135 and did sets inthe slightly higher rep range and youguys see shali here in the backgroundI'm actually Holly's one of my longlongtime friends you may recognize himfrom a few videos in the past but he hasa competition in about three weeks sohe's been working out at the HQ I'mdoing his macros for him and his cardiogoing into his prep and I Charlie'sdoing incredible and I have no problemsaying this to his face I've said thisto his face the day he came to me tosort of help him outhe's only prepping for 7 to 8 weeksright and he has competition I told thembro next time you need to allow yourselfmore time I would say at least giveyourself 12 to 14 weeks in my personalopinion I think 16 to 20 weeks for acompetition prep not to get lean but fora competition prep is perfect that seemto allow you enough time to dropsteadily of course depending whereyou're starting fromstarting-point really dictates thatamount of time you would need to prepsome people may need 24 28 weeks somepeople may need 12 it really justdepends where you're at and what kind ofcondition you want to reach butdefinitely a lot ourself prep prep timeI think the next rep want to do I'mlooking at 16 to 17 weeks I normallydon't actually I never let myself getabove a 15% body fat and so I feel likeyou know a 28 week cut even though it'sPods doable for me it's just not optimalmentally I don't think I can't prep for28 weeks guys I think I could do 16 17possibly 18 weeks but I never let myselfgain too much body fat to the pointwhere takes me that long to diet downand yeah I stick right around that 1 to1.5 pounds or about actually I'm more ofthe 1.5 pounds loss per week kind of guyand like the first few weeks of prep Ilike to do 2 pounds per week becausedropping a lot of water and things likethat but last topic

andinstant result for you we're going tostart with the socks ankle socksno angle socks will bring attention toanything that's big down there so ifyou've got thick ankles or holding fluidthose socksI'm going to show them off because lightcolors make big and dark colors recedeso that light color on my ankles isdrawing all the attention that's sayinglook at me look at me so if your anklesaren't very skinny and beautiful andslim you don't want to wear ankle socksthey look old-fashioned and we can dobetter the next thing I want to drawyour attention to is these shorts thehemline finishes at a very unflatteringpart in my leg and it's emphasizing myknees that aren't very attractive andthat straight line is unattractive andthen we go up to this top this is kindof a uniform for many women but we cando better so we've got a straight lineat the hem and for many of us that's thewidest part of our body so that line isdrawing attention to it and thesestripes don't really look great onanybody a wide stripe makes us lookbigger and see how the arms flare out ofthe sleeve well that's a masculine lookand it's not flattering and it just doesnothing for me and the structured collarin this top is also old fashioned forworkout wear and then I can do somethingreally really wrong and tuck it all inand have a look at me that's not goodand that's not OKso I don't want you to wear your workoutclothes like this and the other fashionrule that I'm breaking here is I have aloose pair of pants and a loose top sothe rule is you wear tight on the bottomand loose up top or loose on top andtight down the bottom the first thingwe're going to fix is my socks and thisis the style of sock that's best to wearthey fit just around the heel and theycome low down so when you've got yourshoes on you can't see them which isgreat you can see there's already a hugeimprovement so if you're wearing socksthat cover your ankles this small tweakwill make you look younger don't beafraid to wear workout tights they areso flattering on your legcompared to shorts but there are acouple of tips with these pants that youdo need to know first number one the hemof the pantsneeds to be at thisany part of your lower leg I'll use theexample here where I'm going to hem itat my carb which is the widest part inmy lower leg and you can see it makes myknees look more wobbly and it's bringingattention to the width of my carbs sothat's not ideal for me it just makes mylegs look strangeand if I take it up to just above myknee which as you can see that's asmaller part of my legit comes in it looks more in harmonywith my leg they don't look all knobbyand wobbly and then if I bring it downagain to show off that tiny bit in myankle it's more in harmony with my legsand it looks so much better so you'll beable to do this with yourself thatlength on the left or the length on theright is perfect for me and that's all Ineed to know now you know we need to getrid of this top one of the most

hey guys and welcome back to my channelso today we're straying a little bitfrom the activewear but not quite I'mreviewing a bunch of gem shark swimwearitems they just launched they're likehorizon collection which has like thehorizon regular bikini the sport bikiniand like the one-piece so I got all ofthose along with the like essence bikinithey launched last summer if you'refamiliar with my channel I have likemixed feelings on Jim shark I love a lotof their stuff and I hate a lot of theirstuff so I'm interested to see howthey're gonna do with swimwear because Ifeel like that's like a little out oftheir comfort zone also go ahead andsubscribe and turn on the notificationbell so you don't miss a video becauseit's summertimeI have more time into making a lot ofvideos so first I have the horizonbikini top the top is $25 so it'sactually a decent price it's kind of abralette shape I'm a little worriedabout this not being very full coverageon me because I do have like a medium tolarge chest I love the low going ontheir swimsuits they just kind of havethis little metal Jim sharks thing soit's not like the classic like vinylthat they put on a lot of theiractivewear they have adjustable strapswhich i think is really great for aswimsuit and the back ties so should beable to make this Demi maybe I shouldhave sized up to a medium just becausethen I could have like adjusted thestraps and everything yeah I reallyliked this red colorit sounds really cute this swimsuit alsohas removable cut pads and it's fullylined I'm probably gonna keep the cuptabs in unless it doesn't really fit theremovable cup pads are nice because whenyou go in the water and it's low cold ithides the nipsso next I have the horizon bikinibottoms these are only $20 so that'salso a pretty good price they have thesame little metal logo in the back therethey say that they're a mid-rise fit andthey have ties on the side so you cankind of like customize them to fit youthe way you wantI got a medium in the bottoms justbecause I thought if I could adjust thestraps then maybe I want to get a mediuminstead of it being too small so yeahthe back doesn't look actually toocheeky it looks like a medium coverageback so let's see I tried to fake tanlast night and it obviously didn't workdon't get Jergens light bronze it doesnothing the top the top you know I havemixed feelings I feel like I tied itlike and I couldn't really have tied itmuch more or else it runs into thestraps so definitely true to size ifsighs down in the top I feel like thetop is like decently flatteringdefinitely more of a bralette fit notany like not really a lot of supportit's not my favorite bikini top I'veever owned like I probably wouldn't getit again but it's not bad and thebottoms I definitely could have gonewith a size small even tying the strapsI honestly couldn't have tie them muchmore because I'm running out of spaceso definitely true to size on thebottoms I wear a small lunch of charcoalleggings and I should have gotten asmall knees it's about a medium coverageso you get that he said about a coverageit's also a decently high leg so that'spretty flattering I don't think it'smost flattering swimsuit I've ever had Ijust like I don't have like a lot ofproblems with it but I think definitelyI could have gotten a different size onthe bottoms and the top is really justokay for me they also have the horizonsports bikini top I got it in the cutelike black-and-white design but theyalso have some solid colors this hub is$30 so a little more expensive than theactual like bralette sale top this onefeels like a little bit cheaply made tobe honest I just feel like this fabricis a little thinit has kind of a racerback fit anddefinitely a lot more coverage than thebralette and it has little like fullylace-up back which probably allows for alittle bit of adjustable this but likeit doesn't lace up all the way to thebottom so it's not gonna be badadjustable these are the horizon bikinibottoms these are a high rise which Itend to like a high rise here and then Ithink it can be cute um definitely asporty earth style swimsuit it's apretty thick elastic on the top so I'mnot sure I love that I feel like thatmight not be the most flattering andthese again are $30 so a little bit moreexpensive than the other horizon bottomsokay here is the sport bikini set Iactually like this a lot more than thelast one the top definitely has a lotmore coverage and like actually feelslike decently supportive if you areactually doing like water sports orsomething I think that this is actuallya really good option I knew that littlecrisscross see details in the back isreally cute and yeah I really don't wantvery many complaints for the topdefinitely feels better than the lastone I know I said it didn't feel likethe best quality when I was putting iton but I changed my mind it actuallyfeels pretty good the bottoms I got onthe size medium and I should have gottensmall so definitely everything is yournormal size sometimes I'm confused ifI'm a smaller medium in the bottoms butI guess I'm small there's just a littlebit of extra space some places for beingso it's kind of hard for me to tell if Ilike it overall because it's not a greatfit on me I think it would definitely bebetter in my normal size but I thinkit's much more flattering on the buttbecause it does sound like a higher cutdetail and this makes your legs looklonger to have this like high cut lookon the side yeah this one's definitelybetter than the first one for me I'm notsure I love this black and white detailI think it's a little weird in thisregion this region so I think maybe thesolid color would be better I justthought the black and white was a littleinteresting better the first one's stillnot my fav then I got the horizonone-piece swimsuit this is $35 sohonestly pretty affordable for aswimsuit has these cute little cutoutpanel type details the fabric feelspretty good on this onethey have adjustable straps which isnice I got a small so I hope it fits mytorso because I do have a longer torsothe pads look like a little cheap inthere just feels like a little flimsy tome but they do have them kind of sewn inso they're not gonna move around likethe whole swimsuit which I definitelythink is nice because when you have aone-piece you don't want your pad to belike down there you know you want to beon your boob where they're supposed togo and the gym shark logo is just alongthe hip there and I'll be interested tosee if this is like a high cut looksdecently high cut maybe mid to high cutI definitely think I cut one piece isvery flattering we have a one-piece thatkind of like it's just kind of like boyshorts a length it's just doesn't nofavors to your legs it makes them lookshort especially for me which I havelike more athletic legswell shorter legs I need some lengthokay few things about this one piecefirst of all I got it in a size small sothis does fit me a lot better than someof the other bottoms the paths youactually can't see them so that doesn'tbother me too much I like that thestraps are adjustable even though Ipersonally didn't have to adjust them Ithink this in a ladder like cutoutdetail is really cute they also made ita high cut so definitely elongate thelegs and it's very flattering in thatsense it's about a medium coverage onthe but it's not quite like song levelbut it's like still like a decent amountof coverand definitely good again for like asporty or type of swim event my onlything is that this is my pet peeve withone-piecesthis fits me but then we have all thisspace in the back here and like I don'tknow what I'm supposed to do because mybut obviously protrudes out more than mylower back and I just think they shouldhave like take it in that waist area alittle bit she would have had a littlemore form-fitting because it is very Idon't know I did something that's veryflattering it makes your butt look kindof small makes it look kind of saggydidn't love that not like overall I'mnot a huge fan of the one-piece I thinkthey have some cute features but I thinkthat just because of this reason it'snot for meand now for the essence top I got it inthis cute peach color and I believe Igot it in a small that's this bikini ismade of this ribbed material it'sdefinitely a more like athletic kind ofshape I don't think this kind of shapeis really flattering on a lot of chestsI'll be interested to see but I justthink it's kind of like makes like alittle uniboob ish kind of thing haslittle Jim shark logo in the back andyeah no adjustable straps or anythingthe paths are removablebut the pads feel a little bit thin tome and I hope they cover my whole boobbecause it looks like kind of a smallpad here are the essence bikini bottomsI believe they changed these to makethem more of like a mid to low risethey're called the essence low-risebikini bottoms and then you look in thedescription and it says mid-rise fit soJim shark which one is it is it mid riseit's a high rise I guess but we will seeit looks like the leg line it's actuallygoing to curve a bit I like when the hippart comes like above your hips and notlike just flat across usually a littlebit more flattering looks like a mediumcoverage in the back definitely gonna bedecently cheeky and have a little Jimshark logo right hereI guess all their swimsuits have thislittle metal decal which I thinkdefinitely adds a little quality makesme feel a little more fancyI seriously don't know what my deal isgetting medium bottoms I'm obviously nota medium so these bottoms a little bigagaincuz I got a medium so I think the top isactually really cute definitely supercompressive and actually has like adecent amount of support so I would alsosay this is more of a sporty top is itmy personal favorite no I prefer tablesigilmore like shape to them that just makelike flatter the boobs a little morenicely so it's not my favorite top but Ithink if you like a little bra let'stile table this is good I also feel likethis table is good for a larger chestbecause it has a decent amount ofsupport as you can see and it's justpretty compressive and good coveragethere's not gonna be any like nip-slipshappening and this could have been somenip slips happening in the red bikiniand for the bottoms I'm just like notsure even if these are the right sizebut they would be the most flyering Ithink there's just like a lot ofmaterial on the front yeah they're sopretty cheeky I do like how the like hemdetail is very curved comes up on thehip even though these are a size too bigI think there's a little too much likecoverage in the front I prefer more morehigh cut Mohini I just think it's alittle more flattering so yeah I'm notin love with the bottomsI think the tops pretty cute but yeaheven if I got the right size I think thebottoms I would still have some issueswith[Music]all right so my honest review is that Ireally didn't love any of the items inthe swim collection I just didn't feellike they all fit me very well I didn'tfeel like any of them were likeperfectly flattering and when you bringa swimsuit you want to feel your bestand I just didn't really feel my best inthese honestly you can get better swimsuits from Savile for way cheaper likeless than half the price so I wouldrecommend that jib shark should juststick to doing their activewearI guess not huge pants when I do likehow they make some of the swimsuits alittle more functional for if you aredoing more sporty activities whichdefinitely works with the fact thatthey're an active wear brand oh yeah Iwouldn't really recommend any of thissave your moneyget another swimsuit somewhere elsehonestly okay thank you guys so much forwatching I hope you enjoyed this videoand I will see you next

[Music]hey guys it's anna and today we're goingto be doing a stretch routine with thebest stretches for improving your backbend along with this routine i'm givingyou a two week stress challenge which isto do this routine daily fortwo weeks to see how much your back bendcan improve and i've also created aplaylistwith a few of my other stretch routinesthat will also help improve your backbendand you can add on to this one if youwould like for a chance to be featuredat the end of one of my videos you canshare your back then transformation withthe hashtag animatechallengeon instagram or take top in order toimprove your backbending you obviouslyneed to know how to get into it firstso before we get into the stretcheshere's a super quick tutorial on how todo a back bendto get into the back bend there are twomain ways either pushing up or fallingbackthe easiest way is to push up so to dothis start by laying on your backand then bend your legs and arms so thatyour hands and feet are flat on theground once you're in that position juststraighten out your arms and lift upyour hips to go into the back ventto fall into a back bend stand with yourarms by your ears and then simply archback until your hands reach the groundwhile falling backwards make sure thatyou're keeping your arm straight andthat your weight stays in your feeti know falling back can be scary atfirst so to start i recommend walkingyour hands down a wall into the backbend then once you're comfortable withwalking down the wall try falling onto ahigher surfaceand slightly lowering the surface untilyou can do it all the way to the groundif you're not sure what to do this onsome household items that could work area bed or a couch to startthen after you could do it on somethingshorter like a couch pillow if youalready have a good amount of backflexibility but are just afraid to fallbackwardsanother way you can practice is byfalling back on your kneesnow that you know how to do the backbend let's go ahead and get started withthe stretch challenge so that you canmake iteven better first we're going to stretchit our arms starting by pulling one arm[Music]overheadnow pull that same arm across your body[Music]and switch arms starting with pulling itover your head again[Music]now pull that arm across your body[Music]next place your hands together behindyour back and then reach forward placingyour arms in front of you to feel a goodstretch in your hamstrings and yourshouldersit's important to have a good amount ofshoulder flexibility to have a goodbackbend so that's why we're doing thisstretchit's totally fine if you can't go as farforward as i'm demonstrating in thisstretchjust go as far as it takes to feel goodto you[Music]go into a downward dog pushing yourchest towards your legs again to stretchout your shouldersi know a lot of you always ask about theoutfits i'm wearing so this one is thenew adapt ombre from gymshark and i'llleave a link to their website down inthe description[Music]now go on to your hands and kneesarching back as far as you can if youcan't go as far back as i'mdemonstrating that's completely finejust go as far as it takes for you tofeel the stretch[Music]and now contract and we're going torepeat these two motions two more times[Music]you can now arch back againcontract[Music]arch back[Music]and contract for the last time[Music]lay down on your stomach and then try tostraighten out your armsif you can get your arms completelystraight without too much of a stretchtry to arch backeven farther until you feel a goodstretch in your back if you can't archback further or straighten out your armsdon't worry just stay where you areand the more often you stretch your backyou should be able to get further backeventually[Music]now we're going to go back up into adownward dog again pushing your chestback[Music]now reach towards either your feet oryour knees depending on how flexible youalready areand then roll back up to standing[Music]for the next few stretches you're goingto need to stand a few feet away from awall[Music]once you're at a wall place your handsup on the wall and then push your chestdown to feel a stretch in your shoulders[Music][Applause][Music]sostaying a few feet away from the wallturn around so that your back is towardsthe walland then reach up and arch back untilyour hands touch the wall we're onlygoing to hold this here for 10 secondssoi believe in you you got this[Music]next try to walk your hands even furtherdown the wall if you don't feelready to go further down the wall yetthen just stay where you are and themore you do this routinethe further down you should be able togetnow if you can walk your hands all theway down the wall until you reach thegroundagain if you don't feel

hello my friends and welcome back to mychannelso today i am going to do a review of astore that i have never tried beforethat is called oro store from aliexpressand we are going to talk aboutactivewearso yeah i have a little bit ofeverything and it's so requested that ireview things that are not from monsterstore and shinebanner so that is what we are going todo today andalso a lot of you have been asking mewhat has happened with your aliexpresscoupons why can't you give us somediscounts soi have actually been reaching out tothis store and asked themif they could give me a discount code inexchange for me doing this reviewso you guys could get some percentageoff sothey agreed to give me a discount codethat is going to be valid for twoweeks but let me know if you do likethisitems if you do like this store and ifyou do like this discount code maybei can ask them to get the code valid forlonger if you do prefer to have it thiscodei will leave down here and i will alsoleave it in the description box downbelow and it will give you six percentdiscount on everything ontheir store so i'm trying to get gooddeals for you so you cansave yourself some money for today'svideo i have two pair of shortsone pair of legging and one pair of onepiecei'm very excited about that one to showyou so let's kick this video offwith the two different pair of shortsthat i am having becausesummertime is just around the corner andi know a lot of you are on the huntfor a good pair of shorts so the firstpair of shorts that i have is thisseamless scrunchy booty shorts and yes iknowthis looks like the ones that i reviewedthe otherday and they are very similar i havethis also in size medium but i will saythat they runsmaller in size so i will definitelyrecommend you to size upin this and in the waist right acrossthe waist we have non-stretched in sizemedium 30 centimeters which is 11.8inchesand you do have a bit of an inner seamso i will call this likebiker shorts and the inner seam is 5inches which is12 12 and a half centimetersthey come with a scrunchie part in theback so this is scrunchy booty and it'sa legit scrunchand the scrunch is stiff so there is nota stretchy scrunchand you also have the contouringunderneathand as you can see this shorts are alittle bit more slimin the legs than what they are in thewaist so i guess that these shorts are alittle more likei will say like chinese sizingum so size medium fits a little bitsmallbut i will say like if you have theproblemthat you are a little bit bigger aroundyour waist i think that this shorts isperfect because if you have like slimmerlegs andwider waist because they are that typeof shape where they are you can see likebigger upper and smaller down herewith that being said let's take a lookhow they are looking on me because i amthe completeopposite i am small around my waist andi have a little bit thicker thighs andthere is no problem for me to use themeither because they area lot of stretch in them as you can seein the try on i can fit themso they go on squat proof and they arecovering cellulitebut i mean they are short so you'regoing to show cellulite on yourthighs but not your booty and super highwaist give compression i meanthese are very similar to the otherscrunchy booty leggings and shorts thati have been reviewing alreadyi will say that they have a lot of timecontrol though so theyare like thicker in the tummy area sothey do give a lot of time compressionif you feel insecure with your tummythen for sure these shorts are doing thedrill for you because they are givingyou a lot of timecontrol i will say like my overallexperience with these shorts is that igive them thumbs upbut i will say do size up because i amin between size small and medium andsize small would definitely have beenway too small for me so definitely sizeup in this if you want to make surethat they are going to fit the otherpair of shorts are very different soit's this type of shorts that hasthe adjustable straps on the sidesuper high waist non seamless anda seamless type of waistband and thisshorts is not having anelastic band in the waist because i knowi've seensimilar variations to this type ofshorts but all of them have been havingelastic bands in the waist and i don'tthink that is asflattering they do not have any scrunchor anything so they are very plain inthe backbut they are doing something nice sincethey have the adjustablethings on the side i have them in sizemedium and this shorts i will say runvery true to sizeso here i will say go for your normalsize and i will also take the measureright across the way 32 centimeterswhich is 12 and a halfinch so very true to size the only thingi can say with this is that theyare like rolling up a little bit i meanyou can adjust thembut when i'm putting up the stripes onthe sides a little biti do get the feeling that they arerolling up but you can of coursehave them folded down and do not take upthe adjustable partin this side and then maybe they willstay down a little bit betterthey have a middle seam but i do nothave any problem with camel toe i thinkit's because i took them in the rightsize my overall experience with theseshorts is prois that they do not have the elasticband in the waist parti also saw that they had matching sportsbras like matching top to this crop topsbut i didn't see it when i ordered but isaw it after when i went into thewebsite again i saw that they had itum and i would love to have this withmatching topbut i think that this short is also verycute to match withother tops the only downside is thatthey are rolling up a little bit in mythighs otherwise i give them thumbs up ithink that they are very niceand i think that they are very unique ihaven't seen so many other stores havingthis on aliexpress soi i like that i mean it's a good pair ofshorts and i like that you can adjustthe lengthin the legs so you can have it a littlemore biker and longer if you want to andyou can definitely have them shorter ifyou want to also soi give them thumbs up i think that theyare pretty it's a good pair of shortsthen let's talk about this one pieceokay so now i've been reviewing what wasthat little songso now i've been reviewing two onepieces here on my channel injust a matter of months but this oneis a seamless one piece withthis scrunchy booty leggings part likethisscrunchy booty same as the shorts that ijust talked aboutso i can say like this one piece is likethe scrunchy booty marl high waistleggings anda top had a baby i have a little bit ofmixed feelings here sothe first mixed feeling that i have isthat it has a pocket herehonestly i mean i like the idea ofhaving pockets on seamless items but idon't know if i like the pocket on thisone piece i think i would have preferredto not have the pocket on this one piecebut that is like the only thing i thinkif i could adjust something i would takeout the pocketsotherwise this one actually is gorgeousi meani have this in size mediumand i mean it fits me likeperfectly it hugs my waist it gives thescrunchy booty partit gives like a booty lift uh i do notneed to wear a bra it comes withpaddings also so it's like a sports brabuilt in in thisthat i will say give a mediumcompression so it's kind of acompressive sports braso this is definitely like a one pieceand you don't need anythingelse underneath maybe underwear if youwant to butotherwise you don't need any bra oranything you are definitely tugged insizing wise i will say they run true tosize i was honestlya little bit scared if i needed to gofor a size largesize medium is fitting me perfectly andi think it is also because it's thistype of seamless it's not giving anychemical or anythinglong enough in the legs i mean you candecide for yourself by looking atthe footage when i'm wearing it but imean i think that it'svery pretty and yeah it's only thepocket that if i could adjust somethingi will take away the pocketbut it's squat proof and it's it givescompressionbut it's not super tight around my coreso i cannot work out in it it'sdefinitelylike i like it it's fitting me perfectit's fitting me niceand it's a fun addition to my collectionbecause i do not have any one pieceslike thisand i really like that they had thescrunchy part in the back and that it'snotleaving me too much cleavage too much ofanything it'sperfectly tugged in but still very funadditionso if you are on the hunt for one pieceand you love the scrunchy bootytype of leggings you're gonna love thisone piece and go for your normal sizethere's no need to slice up or down inthis and they have it in more colorsalso soi will give it thumbs up but thumbs downfor the pocket so last we have thispocket leggings so i was putting alittle poll on my instagram if youprefernon-pocket or pocket leggings some ofyou seems to love the pockets on theback on the leggings and some of youseem to not like it i honestly like itbecause i think it's adding a little bitmore volumeto my booty so thisone's i think it's very pretty it'sactually having pockets bothon the back of the booty and on the sideof theof the thighs and they are legit pocketsall of them so you can put things thereif you want toso this is a non-seamless so they dohave a middle seamthey are higher in the waist and thesehave an elastic band in the top so imean i guess it depends on if you likethe elastic bands or notum i don't mind so much i mean i prefernot having elastic bands in the top ofthe leggings buti don't mind in this ones because theyare hitting melike perfectly in the fl more flatteringpart onmy waist i have this in size medium alsothey go on squat prooflong enough in the legs i will say thatthis fabric is covering upcellulite also i don't have any problemwith my cellulite peeking throughand the fabric is thick enough fortugging me inand not being see-through or anything ilove this color this color is so uniqueit's like thisaubergine purpley i really dying forthis color i think it'ssuper super nice the fabric is verystretchy as isaid but it's leaving me with somecompressioni will say you can go running and youcan do anything you want in theseleggings because they are staying 100 inplace they will notfall down anything so you will not haveany problem with thatand they are as i said long enough inthe legs alsoso in this leggings honestly i havenothing bad to say about themmaybe i mean it depends on if you likethe middle seam or not i don't have anyproblem with camel toe butonce again i think it's because i havethem in the right side i do like thehigh waist but i mean it depends on ifyou likethe elastic band or not i am going totake the mesherof course in size medium as i saidright across the waist where the elasticband is hitting we have30 centimeters which is 11.8 inchesso i will say that they are very true tosize because the elastic band is hittingfurtherup so it's not uncomfortable in any wayand i definitely give thisthumbs up i think this is i think myfavorite piece out ofthis haul and i really like this colorthis color iseverything so definitely something thatis addingsomething extra and special and uniqueto my collection and they had this inmore colors also but this color was myabsolute favorite out of themso yeah this was the things that i hadfromthis new store new store maybe it's

hello my friends and welcome back to mychannelso today i am going to do a review of astore that i have never tried beforethat is called oro store from aliexpressand we are going to talk aboutactivewearso yeah i have a little bit ofeverything and it's so requested that ireview things that are not from monsterstore and shinebanner so that is what we are going todo today andalso a lot of you have been asking mewhat has happened with your aliexpresscoupons why can't you give us somediscounts soi have actually been reaching out tothis store and asked themif they could give me a discount code inexchange for me doing this reviewso you guys could get some percentageoff sothey agreed to give me a discount codethat is going to be valid for twoweeks but let me know if you do likethisitems if you do like this store and ifyou do like this discount code maybei can ask them to get the code valid forlonger if you do prefer to have it thiscodei will leave down here and i will alsoleave it in the description box downbelow and it will give you six percentdiscount on everything ontheir store so i'm trying to get gooddeals for you so you cansave yourself some money for today'svideo i have two pair of shortsone pair of legging and one pair of onepiecei'm very excited about that one to showyou so let's kick this video offwith the two different pair of shortsthat i am having becausesummertime is just around the corner andi know a lot of you are on the huntfor a good pair of shorts so the firstpair of shorts that i have is thisseamless scrunchy booty shorts and yes iknowthis looks like the ones that i reviewedthe otherday and they are very similar i havethis also in size medium but i will saythat they runsmaller in size so i will definitelyrecommend you to size upin this and in the waist right acrossthe waist we have non-stretched in sizemedium 30 centimeters which is 11.8inchesand you do have a bit of an inner seamso i will call this likebiker shorts and the inner seam is 5inches which is12 12 and a half centimetersthey come with a scrunchie part in theback so this is scrunchy booty and it'sa legit scrunchand the scrunch is stiff so there is nota stretchy scrunchand you also have the contouringunderneathand as you can see this shorts are alittle bit more slimin the legs than what they are in thewaist so i guess that these shorts are alittle more likei will say like chinese sizingum so size medium fits a little bitsmallbut i will say like if you have theproblemthat you are a little bit bigger aroundyour waist i think that this shorts isperfect because if you have like slimmerlegs andwider waist because they are that typeof shape where they are you can see likebigger upper and smaller down herewith that being said let's take a lookhow they are looking on me because i amthe completeopposite i am small around my waist andi have a little bit thicker thighs andthere is no problem for me to use themeither because they area lot of stretch in them as you can seein the try on i can fit themso they go on squat proof and they arecovering cellulitebut i mean they are short so you'regoing to show cellulite on yourthighs but not your booty and super highwaist give compression i meanthese are very similar to the otherscrunchy booty leggings and shorts thati have been reviewing alreadyi will say that they have a lot of timecontrol though so theyare like thicker in the tummy area sothey do give a lot of time compressionif you feel insecure with your tummythen for sure these shorts are doing thedrill for you because they are givingyou a lot of timecontrol i will say like my overallexperience with these shorts is that igive them thumbs upbut i will say do size up because i amin between size small and medium andsize small would definitely have beenway too small for me so definitely sizeup in this if you want to make surethat they are going to fit the otherpair of shorts are very different soit's this type of shorts that hasthe adjustable straps on the sidesuper high waist non seamless anda seamless type of waistband and thisshorts is not having anelastic band in the waist because i knowi've seensimilar variations to this type ofshorts but all of them have been havingelastic bands in the waist and i don'tthink that is asflattering they do not have any scrunchor anything so they are very plain inthe backbut they are doing something nice sincethey have the adjustablethings on the side i have them in sizemedium and this shorts i will say runvery true to sizeso here i will say go for your normalsize and i will also take the measureright across the way 32 centimeterswhich is 12 and a halfinch so very true to size the only thingi can say with this is that theyare like rolling up a little bit i meanyou can adjust thembut when i'm putting up the stripes onthe sides a little biti do get the feeling that they arerolling up but you can of coursehave them folded down and do not take upthe adjustable partin this side and then maybe they willstay down a little bit betterthey have a middle seam but i do nothave any problem with camel toe i thinkit's because i took them in the rightsize my overall experience with theseshorts is prois that they do not have the elasticband in the waist parti also saw that they had matching sportsbras like matching top to this crop topsbut i didn't see it when i ordered but isaw it after when i went into thewebsite again i saw that they had itum and i would love to have this withmatching topbut i think that this short is also verycute to match withother tops the only downside is thatthey are rolling up a little bit in mythighs otherwise i give them thumbs up ithink that they are very niceand i think that they are very unique ihaven't seen so many other stores havingthis on aliexpress soi i like that i mean it's a good pair ofshorts and i like that you can adjustthe lengthin the legs so you can have it a littlemore biker and longer if you want to andyou can definitely have them shorter ifyou want to also soi give them thumbs up i think that theyare pretty it's a good pair of shortsthen let's talk about this one pieceokay so now i've been reviewing what wasthat little songso now i've been reviewing two onepieces here on my channel injust a matter of months but this oneis a seamless one piece withthis scrunchy booty leggings

hello hello youtube um my name is sarahand my first video today i thought iwouldshow you um a few bits i've bought fromgymsharkuh from their new collection umthe items i saw on their recently whichi thinkcame out in february so i picked up acar show the whole collectionbecause that would be crazy money for meto buy all of them although i did likelots of the different colors that theyhad on there the summer especiallyi'm five two and a half to threealways that half that gets everyone umand alsoum exercise wise i tend to dojogging so at the moment i'm sort offinishing couch to 5k for the secondtimein a row um i'm halfway through that soi'm doing joggingmostly i need gym wear that can likei can move in easily and an absolutemust for me is it has to be high-waistedso they are kind of things i use it forum and what i need for my exercise gearplus i like to have nice colors i hatewearing blackgenerally so i need nice upliftingcolorsstuff that's going to make me want towear my gym clothes and get me motivatedto exercise as well so i have a fewthings from gymshark alreadyso i thought i could compare maybe acouple of thingsi bought in this hall with what i'vealready got i think just to start withmaybe i'll just tell you what i'vealready got on so i have thispink cropped t-shirtum says gymshark on it on one of thesidesand it's just it curves at the sideand dips at the back and at the frontit's really nice cropped and it fitsreally well with likemeats like leggings really nicelynow these leggings are theum vitalseamless leggings yes the original onesthough not the newnumber twos pair of those i've got in myhaulso these are the original ones these arein a brown colornow they have a high-waisted bandi always get all of my stuff in a smalleverything always in the small i'm abouta uksize eight uh both top and bottomso reference so it has a high waistbandwhich i like but i likely it's not toovisiblei'm not that keen on the waistbandswhere it has big letteringbecause i feel like it draws attentionto the areaum the band is quite smoothon the back ribbing the band has gotlike a ribbingeffect and thenthe bottom now they're a bitum it's only a bit long for me butactually i don't mind because whenyou're in trainersyou can tuck them in do your trainersthe endsbut i am five two and a half so i thinkfor any normal sized person theywouldn't be longum these are a full length now they havelike a slight ribbingat the bottom um of the leggingand then the rest of it's just kind ofall smooth basicallythere are no pockets on the vitalseamless leggingsbut i think the main thing i like aboutthese are that they're full lengthum and just very like simpleand also like the colors i've onlyactually only gotbut she only got one pair of these so idid want to trysome more of these ones the brown goesreally nice for the pink it goes niceand mint it goes nice and blueit actually goes really nicely with alot of colors sothe brown is kind of like a black for meokay so theseare new vital seamlessleggings but number two so from thesecond rangeso as you can seethey're actually full length umthis is a first impression so literallyi don't think so on these ones comparedto the brown ones i've got onthere's a logo on the back of the legor by the ankle which is not which i'mlike fine with i don't mind that at alland the cuffs are actually likethere's like a proper cuff there at thebottom so there's like a stitch in hereand the waistband is very much the sameas the ones i've got onin terms of high-waisted and like not anoverly visible waistband which i likethese are in the light blue color nowthey did have them in a really beautifulyellowand a black was there any othersi think that was it oh no and the taupethe taupenow i don't have the taupe ones but ihave got another topi'll show you in a bit that is kind ofthe taupe grayi think color very similar anyway soyou'll getto see the idea of the colorum and then you just got the logo at thefrontso yeah they seem very similar solet's try them on umin a moment and see what we think umi'm going to get a top to put on withthem so you can see what they look likebut next let's trya sports cloth i don't really need anymore sports bras i'm not gonna liebut because it was in this reallybeautiful blue colori really had to get it i'm obsessed withblueas you'll see mostly to be honest all ofthis haul is and blue stuff pretty muchapart from one itemsothis umis a light blue color it's coming upmoreit's coming out light blue on the camerabut it's coming up more brighterit's actually say slightly more babybluein real life um thisis a low support bra so idon't particularly need ummuch support to be honest and these havethe paddingremovable padding so you can remove theminside of the back there which is greatand this gym sharp glue gun the frontis what i really like is it's like thiskind of siliconeyfeel which is quiet pleasant to touchum this is very small detail reallynow like the othersi have a feeling thisi can't remember exactly which rangethis is wrong but i do have another brafrom gymshark that's very much like thiswhereso you can see it's got a really nicecross backthere lovely cross backwhich can i just say it can getconfusing when you're trying to just putit on because you're working out whereto put your armsum with a cross shape but maybe that'sjust mebut anyway there's two layers what iwant to sayso there'skind of that's the joined but there'slike two layers hereand so you've got the bra there it'salmost likea top on top of a bra so crop top on topof a braso it's a double layeredbrush basically but it's an all-in-onewhich is quite niceum i have got one like thatfrom so i already have thisalthough it's slightly actually the backslightly different it'sit's from thevital rise vital rise i thinkback to rise collection again but it'slike top see this is where it getsconfusing for meit's like a top and a bra at onceugh let's saytoo confusing bra here and then this isthe top down herebut again they're joined so they've donea simple thing here with a vitalseamlessbra so yeah i'll show you that um in asecond withthe umvital seamless leggings which now saythey're not the same blueuh the this is more like umthe leggings are more of acornflower blue i guess and then this ismore like a proper lightbaby blue sports bra but i still thinkthey would go really nice togetherokay i'm back so i'm gonna show youum so these are leggingsvery similar in terms ofthe waistband umi mean they're so flattering all of theleggingsand this is the back these don't haveany pocketsum in these leggings i think the onlyones i haveleggings wise from gym shark that arehave a pocket are the vital rise oneswhich areso it has like this pocket on the sideat the back on the waistbandit's i think it goes really well withthe sports bra um[Music]now i'd say these are pretty along formeum if you can tell butthey're quite bunched up at the bottomso if you're kind ofmy height five foot two to maybe fivethreefour they'll probably be slightly a bittoo long but maybe if you're a bitum taller that'd be fine one thing inoticed actuallywas like the stitching on the inside legis reallyyou can see like a reallysort of like line the stitchinglike a blue color which is quite niceextra detail so yeah overalli really like it now brow wiseit was actually fine to get on it wasn'ttoo complicatedum it'syeah the paddings things are annoyingwhen you put them in a washas you know you will say umbecause obviously just keep moving youhave to keep readjusting themso i don't know if i'd keep them butthey're handyto start with i guess um what i reallylove about itis the detail at the backi'll have the tagyou see that's really niceum it's really nice especially in thesummer whenyou're wearing a vest top and you canactually see the detail obviously othersin the winterwhen i'm running i'm just wearing a longsleeve soto be honest like no one's gonna seethat detail butit's not it's a really nice like umdetail to have andi really like that they come down quitefar like in terms oflike meats you only got a little bit ofskin leftto [ __ ] on show once you've gothigh-waisted leggings onyou can see it comes down um and lowon the sideso yeah overall i think this is a reallynice actuallyreally lovely for um spring and summerum especiallyso the next item i've got to showis thisum tank topnow i think it's like showing up a bitdarker than what it actually isin real life um but it'sa light blue it's actuallyin between both the sports bra and theleggingsin terms of um colorand it just says gymshark at the frontjust turn around guys umso as you can might be able to see thecolor betteron there and i'm gonna just try this soi got this in a small now this is fromthe fiti think this is a fit rangei'll leave links below and umi think the thing i love most about thisis how soft it isit's so soft andit really meets at a really nice lengthactually especially as i'm sure like idon't think sliding is too longbut it's really flatteringas well look back it's like a drop downthere but it's not an exaggerated hemand at the top it's like nice necklineat the side it's like a dropped slightlydropped handbut not too baggy that when you're likeum kind of doing you know like you'redoing hit workout and you'rei don't know like doing bicycle umkind of exercise moves and you you knowyou're leading forwardit's not going to like really leanforward basically and startlike sagging too much at some of thebest stops i've triedalike so yeah i really like thisactually umit's a really nice color but it's notfrom a new range but it just goes reallynicely withthe leggings next thing i've got isum something from the adapt the newadapter rangei'm just trying to find in the bagoh my words this color is absolutelybeautifulit's turquoise color now the reason igot these actuallyis um because i have a very similarcolored pair from nike which i've hadfor yearsand i absolutely love um it's not quitean animal printas these areexcuse the nails guys it's locked downlifeum but yeah i have a similar pair fromnike and i actually love thembut the waistband has gone loose whichis just so annoyingand that's one thing i'd say i haven'tnoticed from gymshark so theirwaistbands don't gosaggy which my like ones have so ireally want toreplace those with thesenow these arefrom what i can tell a full lengthleg in um again like all of my otherleggings high-waistedhave to buy high-waisted i can't buyanything elseso they have a very toy soundvery similar to the seamless twoi guess and then you just got the gymsharkthereso they're kind of ripped all the waydown actuallyand they're very stretchy but yeah theykind of ripped all the way downa very subtle ribbon i think it justhelps as a stretch again you've gotcuffs at the bottom as wellsnow pockets on these ones eitherthese really remind me ofi think they're likethey're very much like the vitalseamless to be honesti'm not quite sure the only differencefor meis literally the fact that there's a gymshark down the side on one layerand then on the vat of seamless you'vegot the actual logo hereso literally that's the only differencethat's literally the only differenceso i'll give those a try see what ithink of thoseand the last item kind of really needlong-sleeve track topsto go over my vests and t-shirts andthings like thatand i have a couple from nike whichobviously love which were quiteexpensiveabout 50 pounds yeah 50 pounds i boughtthem years agoand they have really lasted and but youknow i've only gota couple of them so i needed a new oneso i saw this one on the gym track nowthe ones on gym trucks sell out reallyquickly that's one thing i will say isaw loads of colors different ones ilikebut um yeah this is the only one i couldget my hands onso it's from the it's from the vitalseamless collection actuallyand it's a lovely taupe color andit's a half zip sothe zip goes down to the top of yourstomachum it's like a high neck which is nicethis taupe color i think is what theyhave inlike the other version of these blueleggings i have on nowum and then at the back it's got a logothere so and thenit's a very soft material actually andit is ataupe mall so that's what i think ishould say it's like it's got thateffect mild effectlike a lot of this stuff hasn't actuallythe blue leggings i've got on i've alsogot that effect as welland thesleeves are rippedfrom about there they're rippedand they've got the holes the fingerholesas well just get in the winterand yeah it's ribbed on the on the bandlike at the bottom as wellwhich is useful so yeah i'm gonna givethat a go nowi'm back now i've got this long sleevetop onnow one thing i didn't realize was onthe dribble sharklike long sleeves the handsgo on the little finger rather than onthe first thing or the thumb but that'sfine feels a bit weirdat first um yeah i really likeneck andzip and it's really softthe only thing is it's quite long likeyou can stretch it down really long butto be honest when you're runninglike this will just go really up hereanyway soi think it's just it just means there'sa lot of bunching up butyou get that with a lot of these longzips anyway it does actually slightlysort of like drop down as a dropped headat the back slightly as well which isquite a nice detailum but this is realistically how it willend upworking on me to be honest umso yeah like it andso these are the adaptleggings animal leggings umagain i haven't pulled them up properlythey can go so high-waistedum i've seen less bunching with theseactually than some of the othersso they're incredibly high-waistedwhich is great there are no pockets justrippinghere and actually the cuffsand shoulder cuffsso yeah not too much punching once i'vepulled them out properlyand yeah here's what they look likeon the sideso yeah like not much to say abouttoo much about the vital the adapt sorryanimal leggingsone thing i'd say is they're moreexpensive thanum the other leggings i haveso these the only price i rememberactually from this haul wasthe adapter animal leggings were 50poundswhereas some of the other ones i havearound 40 45 maybeso anything i will say this is likethey probably feel lighter weight towear soa lot stretchier than even the vitalseamlessi think because i've got pretty much gotthis ribbing all the way downin fact um but 50 pounds a lot of moneyto payfor a pair of leggings so just comparingthemthese adapt to the vital seamless ithink definitely likethese adapt ones have ribbon all the waydowni think that's what makes them reallyfeel really lightweightand stretchy right as the vital seamlessare literallylike there is no ribbing well there isrippingbut only down the second half of the legactuallyum so that's clearly what you're payingthe price for is that extra stretchin the leggings but the design is alsoreally nice as wellthey do the sports bra and the adapteranimal they do it in thisturquoise green color that i've got onthey also do it in a greywhich is really nice i have seen it thisis not the first adapter animalrange they've done so they have actuallydone other colors as well which i'veseen some really nice colorsof ocean pinks and greens other greenssoi definitely want to maybe invest in acouple of thosebut i think these leggings are the firstones or 50 poundso but what i'll do is i'll put all thedetails in the description box belowthat link so you can check out kind ofthe details of themand the pricing and for all of

they learnand when did they realize they weredoing their life's workin this series i sit down with inspiringentrepreneurs foundersand makers to hear their stories aboutbuilding their businessfrom the ground up this is the life of arebelhey everyone uh harley here and uh todayi have noel mack hereuh who's been a long time merchant butalso a friend of mine and of shopify'suh noel is jim shark's chief brandofficer and he's joining me todayno before we begin um give me the shortback storyon how you became jim shark's chiefbrand officerand and how that all happened so i stoleben's job not many people know this butben used to be my boss and was the chiefbrand officer and i sat down with himone day and saidlisten man i think if both of us went tothe interview for chief brand officeri think i know who would get it and helooked back at me and went yeah i thinki do tooand then he gave me the job so i tookthat off him um but he went it went likethis i i had a creative agency beforethis doing all the stuff ido here now at gymshark pretty much anduh ben and his old business partner camealong there's two young kidswith no budget no idea what they wantedto do they just knew they wanted to makesome content and it was really creepybecausei was used to telling people why theyshould invest in content these kidsalready got it and i just like them sothe first ever pieces of content thatjim sharp produced were made by me andmy guysand then you know we did more and moreand more and it got to a point where bensaid why don't we create thissort of content machine and influenceand marketing all this kind of stuff inhouse at gymshark and we dowhat you guys do in-house i came in asthe creative director then branddirector and then like i saidben was chief brand officer and ithought man i need that job so i took itoff himwe've all heard the the famous sort ofhenry ford quotewhich is if i asked people what theywanted they would have said a fastercourse how does that statement resonatefor you right nowa lot there's there's a there's athere's a shopify interview where i'mquoted as sayingthat one of your guys jason wasinterviewing us and he kept sort ofhe kept really bigging me and ben up andsaying god you guys are so good at thisand that and really giving us showing usin compliments right and i said man isaid listenwe're not great marketeers we're goodlisteners there's a differencewe listen to what the audience say andand you know we act on that andand in that way you never really feellike you're going out on a limb with thegymshark community because by and largethey've probably informed you know thedecisions that you're makinghowever the henry ford statementand another person i massively respectis ricky gervais and i don't knowhe always says i don't know where we gotit from but i think the guy's a geniusand he saidto conduct the orchestra sometimes youhave to turn your back on the audienceand i think that's also very true aswell so yes we're very very aware ofwhat the community want we listen tothemi always say i said to um the thevaynermedia guys recently on aninterviewthat there's gold in instagram commentslike brands should spend less timetalking to their audience some more timelistening to their audience there's goldin those comments if they just readthroughin their comments and in theircompetitors but there are those momentswhere you have to gopeople don't always know what they wantsometimes you have to show them whatthey want so yeah i think i think ifi think if you're an overbearingdictator and you're constantly trying toserve them the new the new big ideait's it i don't think don't think that'sgoing to go well either you have tostrike that balance nicely understandwhat they're saying to you but then alsounderstand that sometimes you're goingto have toshow them what they want next i thinkone of the things thati'm always most impressed with is thatyou have very muchblended the definition of who is acustomerwho is a fan of yours who is aninfluencer of yourswho is part of your marketing team umand who's just someone who likes to wearyour clothingum how do you think about that i meanobviously we can get into influenceruh strategy later on but but that almostis not as important to me asis how do you consider someone um a fanversus a consumer versussomeone who is an extended part of themarketing teamwell i could i could i could draw out avery marketing cmostyle diagram of the the ambassadorshiptriangle which is the athletes at thetop and then our customers the nextthe next lower tier after that but to behonest that's me sort of backwardstranslating into sort ofmarketing talk we use the word family alot andwe just we just act as such like wealways say like if we hadn't beencreating gymshark when we did we wouldhave been wearing it we would have beenone of the you know the fans the peopleinvolved in the communityso we've never really consideredourselves above them for any reasonright there's a famousi know you guys love the story aboutwhen we moved to magento and it all wentsouthand the whole thing nearly one of myfavorite storiesthough when the whole thing nearly diedben sat and wrote likethousands of thousands of apology cardsand white happenedand here you know what i'm saying therewas never any there was nowell i'm the founder or the ceo themajority shareholder and that just iswhat it is andlike hiding behind you know pressstatements or anything like that it wasdear tom i'm so sorry about whathappenedas though you would to another member ofyour family i'm saying like a trueconversation fierce appearwhen we did the world tour we called ita world tour it wasn't a world tour butit was basically myselfben three athletes we we jumped on aplane flew in economy rented the carfrom hertzand said we will be in times square at12 o'clock let's hang outand just just thousands of peopledescended that's where the big pop-upstores that you see now all came fromand it was just the most it was just themost sort of ghetto throw it together it let's just do it and see whathappens kind of uhyou know experiential marketing we coulddo but all that time we were we wereconstantly on the receiving end of allthis qual feedback you know what i'msaying and understanding and data eventhough you don't realize that's what itis at the timeit sharpens your idea of what jim sharpneeds to be we sharpen thisunderstanding constantly throughuh social media through hanging out withthe audience through asking questions toanswering questionsof what they want from us and equally wehave a vision what we want to be to themand somewhere in the middle of thatthere's there's an amazing hundred yearbrand being builti think because you've been limited byresources for so long and certainlyin the shopify story the same thing wehad to get really creative because wedidn't necessarilyhave a lot of resources so we had tobecome very resourcefuland this idea that creativity startswhen the constraints get appliedis so important in the early days of anybusiness because there are so manyconstraintsand i think if you had adopted thiscompany withyou know a billion dollars in cash inthe balance sheet and a massiveyou know sales machine as opposed tohaving to build it from scratchyou probably would have had a biggerevent in times square it probablywouldn't have felt nearly as authentic ahundred percent yeah i would sayit's no secret right everybody's seeingthe news that we just achieved theunicorn statuswhen we were going through that wholeinvestment process and and the uh thepotential investors are speaking to meand sayingum how is it you've how is it you've youknow happened across thesethese innovative marketing strategiesand this new way of building brands andit was like because we didn't have wewe couldn't do it the way everybody elsedid well i couldn't i can't go pound forpound against nike i will lose thatbattle you know what i'm saying i keptsaying to those guysif i had to fight floyd mayweather i'mnot gonna box with him you know what i'msayingi'm gonna kick him in the balls and i'mgonna try and get my friend to hit himwith the car i'm gonna figure somethingelse out you know what i'm sayingand that's what we're doing withgymshark we're constantly like hackingand trying other things to get aroundbecause we can't play that same gamelet's let's talk quickly about thatbecause a lot of folks that are watchingthis right noware trying to build their own brandthey're trying to build their ownbusinessand i'd love to ask you you know youtalk a lot about listening to youraudience and helpingand and having them help guide yourstrategy your brand your companybut what advice would you give tosomeone who doesn't yet have an audienceuh who's just starting a store you knowon day onethere will be other brands out theredoing what you're doing already like youknowpotential rivals in the future slash uhvery similar thingsthat you're doing hang out in theircomments right find out where theircommunity their customers are gettingannoyed at themand there's there's opportunity therefor sure i'm not saying you reply rightaway like hey hey come over to my brandbecause that's kind of uncool right butjustthat should that should start tofine-tune your understanding of what'swhat's where the gap is in that marketyou know what i'm saying so if you canfindlittle nuggets of information amongstthere fulfill that need it won't be verylong until people are saying hey i knowyou you knowyou're having a bad experience overthere have you seen these guys um so ithink there'syeah i think people start startbusinesses too early they start worryingabout what their ads say their copythey're creativeand they just basically they're goingout there with a megaphone shoutingabout what their brand israther than going out with the megaphonego out and listen and then try and youknowslowly address those pain points sowe're going to watch a couple of videosuh right now videos that you have allproduced inside of jim shark and i wantto get your reaction to it i want tounderstand it a little bit better solet's play themso yeah this was um that's definitelyone of my favoriteblack friday uh campaigns to date sosome likewe've been trying to build up this thingwith black friday right i know in thee-commerce world in fact when i spoke atcommerce plus in new yorkuh hannah abbas was interviewing me andthere was the screen in front with allthe questionsevery single question was about blackfriday is it true you guys hadx hundred thousand people on yourwebsite at once all this stuff so everyyearwe know we have to raise the bar when itcomes to black friday and with this oneand one black friday you actually turnthe site off yeah we did yeahdisruption disruption i love no i i loveit but tell me about this video herelike this is shot in slow-molike how did it all work yeah yeah so umso well the whole the whole thinking washow are we gonna stand out this yearright and we thought the idea of seeingyour favorite influencersfighting over jim sharp products youknow tackling each other through theboxes you'rewrestling each other exactly you hadryan garcia uhone of the most influential names inboxing right now standing head-to-headwith tatiana suarez one of the hottestfemale ufc fighters like arguing over agymshark hoodie or whatever it was um sofirst of all we knew the concept wouldmake people laughsecond of all we knew we were buildingup this reputation in the industry andwith the consumers that the gym sharksite ischaos on black friday right and wethought how better to actually bringthatthan to bring that to life in real timeand we've all seen those videosthe sort of the data behind it was we'veall seen those videos whereuh the doors open at walmart or asthey're in the ukpeople are saying yeah exactly peopleare punching each other in the face for20off a tv set right and we thought we'veall seen those clips go viral so itstands to reason if we do that with thegymshark athletes we'll get a lot ofshares and we can go viral online soyeah that's where it came fromi love that all right let's show anotherclip here let's roll something elsethis is this is fun man i like this[Applause]so yeah what this is about um there's alot of sort of gym shark imposters onsocial mediauh pretending to be us for for aplethora of reasons to be honest they'reeither trying to sellknock off gymshark products which we weconstantly deal with but you knowlike like you said earlier harleythere's a lot of big brands with a lotof money in the war chest and can't stopthat from happening so we can't eitherum so there's that but the bigger thingand this thisalmost talks to us of protecting ourcommunity is there are there arevery strange people out there who willpretend to be jim shark on social mediaand say we're interested in making you agymshark athleteand asked to send in like photographs ofthem and measurements and can you sendone in your bra and weird things likethatso although it's not us and it hasnothing to do with uswe feel we owe our community somethingright yeah we feel responsible to sayyou know make sure you don't fall forthis nobody from gymshark will everreach out to you in this way if itdoesn't have a blue tick it's not comingfrom usum it's it it's alarming social media isa social media is a great place forbrands like us right and for contentlike this and stuffbut there is also some really darkcorners of it and if we can help combatthat then we absolutely shouldi love that all right let's let's rollone moreso here's how it went down onei wanted to use my student discount codewhich was no problemi just got my code ready earlier in theday to save timetwo i acted fast items are not reservedin your carthree so what happens here is we mixedin the actual campaign content the thethe uh the guy giving the uh news flashthethe bde uh sale has gone live and thenit's here's some stories of peoplewho've successfully shot beforeso blaise who's in the campaign videothat explains how she successfullyshopped during the black friday periodlast year so she says things likeyou know i was logged in i had mystudent discount ready i had did iti knew which one i wanted i did it to mycart and the reason we do that isbecauseto put it into sort of bricks and mortarterms like we mentioned earlier runninginto walmart to get a tv setwe just gave blaze them we just we'regiving the customers the map of wherethe thing they wanted you know what i'msayingyou guys know better than anyone rightthat much traffic is in a website at onetimeis not good for the website so what wewant to try and do is equip theconsumers with as much info on how tosuccessfully shop during the blackfridays out as possibleum and it also it leads to a bettercustomerexperience for them and it alsoalleviates pressure on the customerexperience teams here the social guysyou know i'm saying all that kind ofstuffhey guys is is student discount turnedon or do i need to be logged in canwill things get cleared from my car wetry and front load and answer all thosequestionsbefore that 7 pm go live so by the timeyou're thereyou've got that fastest finger firstmentality they're ready to go they knowwhat they want they're logged inand you know their chances of gettingwhat they want during the sale periodyou know tripled we have one more ithink to showso this is a pretty standard video thatwe've seenyou you've seen this a million times forsuretell us what's going on here so this isthe when the pandemic first hit you hadall these people at a loss of you knowhow to train where to train what totrainum so we turn to our athletes and sayright what we need from you guys ishelp the community they can't get intothe gym so you explaining how to benchpressisn't going to work for them anymore weneed you to flood your social media weneed content that we can repostof how people can get a workout in fromhome because we understand just how muchphysical health is intrinsically linkedto mental health as well right and itwas a dark time for a lot of people outthereand we had all these super inspirationalpeople right from the biggest fitnessinfluencers in the worldwith a way to inspire people and helpthem get a bit of a sweat on from homeand we did that in awe did that in a ton of different waysbut going back to what we talked aboutearliersome of that some of that content wassome of the best performing content weever put out rightum so the the thing you mentioned harleyof almost that defeatist attitude of ohit's okay for jim shark they've alreadygot millions of followers so their stuffcan go viralthis shows that you don't need the highproduction value right you don't needtheyou don't need the creative directorsyou don't need the agencies you don'tneed the storyboards you just needthat great understanding of the painpoints of your customer right now and totry and address it and isisn't that the best part ofentrepreneurship or retail or commerceor brand buildingis that again you don't need to have themost amount of capital the most amountof resourcesyou just have to be authentic andresourceful what this video does andwhat the series of videos doesis that it gives value uh the irony ofus talking about how you needhuge creative budget to make it you knowmake content resonateus we we changed that into home shark ontwitter we screenshotted thatwe put it on instagram and we wrotewe've changed our name to home sharkbecause some of you guys needed toremind me to remind you to stay at homebecause not everyone everybody wasabiding by the rules and that is ourmostliked most engaged piece of content jimshark has ever put out as a brand nowlet me go back tolet me go back to what it took to createthat an understanding of the consumersright and the current situation theyfound themselves inso entered some text on twitterscreenshot post not one camera wasinvolved in the making of our mosthighly engaged piece of content everand i said i said and and you know theysaw that it made them laugh it resonatedwith them they reposted it they saw whatwe didwe helped out the nhs here in the uk andi always i said itin again in the in the the shopifyinterview i did with you guys jasoni stole this thing from the irish primeminister that let them say of us whentimes were at their worst we were ourbestand that's what i had in my entirethat's what i had in my head the entiretime during the pandemicwhat can we do to put our values ondisplay to the world and make them saywhen it all went to jim sharp werethere and jim shark gave us what weneededi'm writing that down when times were attheir worst we were at our bestyeah let them say of us when times wereat their worst we were our best that'ssomething he said when he addressed hisfirst address to the nation and iabsolutely loved it you resonated withme i said it on the jim shark internalpodcast i said it on the interview withshopify andit can't have been more true for jimsharp the amount of stuff we did duringthe pandemic during lockdownand i know that we made people you knowcmos will talk about the ltv of acustomerand if you want to put it into thoseterms i know that the ltv of a bunch ofcustomers went through the roof but whati know more than everor so the more the way i would put it iswe strengthen the family ties between usand the communitymore than we could have you know throughany marketing any contentany traditional stuff we could have donethere is nothingthat builds more trust than when thingsare toughyou showing up in the right way notshowing up in the easy wayyou know but in the right way insteadand usually the right way cost you moretakes more time is more challenging thanthe easy way but it almost always paysoff longer term andand the payoff is is you build brandslike like gymsharkcouldn't agree more so before we we weleave it i want to be respectful of yourtime and and let you get back to workone thing that that i think is reallyimportant is right now there'sit feels like the world is in need ofmore inspiration the world is need inneed of moresupport and and and guidance and helpand careand and you know what's one thing thatyou would say to someone whowants to build something special wantsto build the next gym shark or the nextshopifywhat is something you would say to themtoday so a lot of people know the jimshark story they're inspired by it nowright and they they knowthey know of ben francis the wonderboyentrepreneur he's the new richardbranson and all this stuff butthe one thing i'd say is we're a lotmore scaredof the next 19 year old in the garagethan we are ofthe board at nike or adidas or lululemonor any of those guyswe're a lot more scared of that next kidso you might just be that next kidi love that that's so impactful thankyou so much for spending some time uhwith us noeland uh congrats on all your continuedsuccess and and thanks for just thanksfor being my friend thanks for being afriend of shopify'sand uh and and i love that you folksnever make any small plansand you continue to inspire me

all the stuff ido here now at gymshark pretty much anduh ben and his old business partner camealong there's two young kidswith no budget no idea what they wantedto do they just knew they wanted to makesome content and it was really creepybecausei was used to telling people why theyshould invest in content these kidsalready got it and i just like them sothe first ever pieces of content thatjim sharp produced were made by me andmy guysand then you know we did more and moreand more and it got to a point where bensaid why don't we create thissort of content machine and influenceand marketing all this kind of stuff inhouse at gymshark and we dowhat you guys do in-house i came in asthe creative director then branddirector and then like i saidben was chief brand officer and ithought man i need that job so i took itoff himwe've all heard the the famous sort ofhenry ford quotewhich is if i asked people what theywanted they would have said a fastercourse how does that statement resonatefor you right nowa lot there's there's a there's athere's a shopify interview where i'mquoted as sayingthat one of your guys jason wasinterviewing us and he kept sort ofhe kept really bigging me and ben up andsaying god you guys are so good at thisand that and really giving us showing usin compliments right and i said man isaid listenwe're not great marketeers we're goodlisteners there's a differencewe listen to what the audience say andand you know we act on that andand in that way you never really feellike you're going out on a limb with thegymshark community because by and largethey've probably informed you know thedecisions that you're makinghowever the henry ford statementand another person i massively respectis ricky gervais and i don't knowhe always says i don't know where we gotit from but i think the guy's a geniusand he saidto conduct the orchestra sometimes youhave to turn your back on the audienceand i think that's also very true aswell so yes we're very very aware ofwhat the community want we listen tothemi always say i said to um the thevaynermedia guys recently on aninterviewthat there's gold in instagram commentslike brands should spend less timetalking to their audience some more timelistening to their audience there's goldin those comments if they just readthroughin their comments and in theircompetitors but there are those momentswhere you have to gopeople don't always know what they wantsometimes you have to show them whatthey want so yeah i think i think ifi think if you're an overbearingdictator and you're constantly trying toserve them the new the new big ideait's it i don't think don't think that'sgoing to go well either you have tostrike that balance nicely understandwhat they're saying to you but then alsounderstand that sometimes you're goingto have toshow them what they want next i thinkone of the things thati'm always most impressed with is thatyou have very muchblended the definition of who is acustomerwho is a fan of yours who is aninfluencer of yourswho is part of your marketing team umand who's just someone who likes to wearyour clothingum how do you think about that i meanobviously we can get into influenceruh strategy later on but but that almostis not as important to me asis how do you consider someone um a fanversus a consumer versussomeone who is an extended part of themarketing teamwell i could i could i could draw out avery marketing cmostyle diagram of the the ambassadorshiptriangle which is the athletes at thetop and then our customers the nextthe next lower tier after that but to behonest that's me sort of backwardstranslating into sort ofmarketing talk we use the word family alot andwe just we just act as such like wealways say like if we hadn't beencreating gymshark when we did we wouldhave been wearing it we would have beenone of the you know the fans the peopleinvolved in the communityso we've never really consideredourselves above them for any reasonright there's a famousi know you guys love the story aboutwhen we moved to magento and it all wentsouthand the whole thing nearly one of myfavorite storiesthough when the whole thing nearly diedben sat and wrote likethousands of thousands of apology cardsand white happenedand here you know what i'm saying therewas never any there was nowell i'm the founder or the ceo themajority shareholder and that just iswhat it is andlike hiding behind you know pressstatements or anything like that it wasdear tom i'm so sorry about whathappenedas though you would to another member ofyour family i'm saying like a trueconversation fierce appearwhen we did the world tour we called ita world tour it wasn't a world tour butit was basically myselfben three athletes we we jumped on aplane flew in economy rented the carfrom hertzand said we will be in times square at12 o'clock let's hang outand just just thousands of peopledescended that's where the big pop-upstores that you see now all came fromand it was just the most it was just themost sort of ghetto throw it together it let's just do it and see whathappens kind of uhyou know experiential marketing we coulddo but all that time we were we wereconstantly on the receiving end of allthis qual feedback you know what i'msaying and understanding and data eventhough you don't realize that's what itis at the timeit sharpens your idea of what jim sharpneeds to be we sharpen thisunderstanding constantly throughuh social media through hanging out withthe audience through asking questions toanswering questionsof what they want from us and equally wehave a vision what we want to be to themand somewhere in the middle of thatthere's there's an amazing hundred yearbrand being builti think because you've been limited byresources for so long and certainlyin the shopify story the same thing wehad to get really creative because wedidn't necessarilyhave a lot of resources so we had tobecome very resourcefuland this idea that creativity startswhen the constraints get appliedis so important in the early days of anybusiness because there are so manyconstraintsand i think if you had adopted thiscompany withyou know a billion dollars in cash inthe balance sheet and a massiveyou know sales machine as opposed tohaving to build it from scratchyou probably would have had a biggerevent in times square it probablywouldn't have felt nearly as authentic ahundred percent yeah i would sayit's no secret right everybody's seeingthe news that we just achieved theunicorn statuswhen we were going through that wholeinvestment process and and the uh thepotential investors are speaking to meand sayingum how is it you've how is it you've youknow happened across thesethese innovative marketing strategiesand this new way of building brands andit was like because we didn't have wewe couldn't do it the way everybody elsedid well i couldn't i can't go pound forpound against nike i will lose thatbattle you know what i'm saying i keptsaying to those guysif i had to fight floyd mayweather i'mnot gonna box with him you know what i'msayingi'm gonna kick him in the balls and i'mgonna try and get my friend to hit himwith the car i'm gonna figure somethingelse out you know what i'm sayingand that's what we're doing withgymshark we're constantly like hackingand trying other things to get aroundbecause we can't play that same gamelet's let's talk quickly about thatbecause a lot of folks that are watchingthis right noware trying to build their own brandthey're trying to build their ownbusinessand i'd love to ask you you know youtalk a lot about listening to youraudience and helpingand and having them help guide yourstrategy your brand your companybut what advice would you give tosomeone who doesn't yet have an audienceuh who's just starting a store you knowon day onethere will be other brands out theredoing what you're doing already like youknowpotential rivals in the future slash uhvery similar thingsthat you're doing hang out in theircomments right find out where theircommunity their customers are gettingannoyed at themand there's there's opportunity therefor sure i'm not saying you reply rightaway like hey hey come over to my brandbecause that's kind of uncool right butjustthat should that should start tofine-tune your understanding of what'swhat's where the gap is in that marketyou know what i'm saying so if you canfindlittle nuggets of information amongstthere fulfill that need it won't be verylong until people are saying hey i knowyou you knowyou're having a bad experience overthere have you seen these guys um so ithink there'syeah i think people start startbusinesses too early they start worryingabout what their ads say their copythey're creativeand they just basically they're goingout there with a megaphone shoutingabout what their brand israther than going out with the megaphonego out and listen and then try and youknowslowly address those pain points sowe're going to watch a couple of videosuh right now videos that you have allproduced inside of jim shark and i wantto get your reaction to it i want tounderstand it a little bit better solet's play themso yeah this was um that's definitelyone of my favoriteblack friday uh campaigns to date sosome likewe've been trying to build up this thingwith black friday right i know in thee-commerce world in fact when i spoke atcommerce plus in new yorkuh hannah abbas was interviewing me andthere was the screen in front with allthe questionsevery single question was about blackfriday is it true you guys hadx hundred thousand people on yourwebsite at once all this stuff so everyyearwe know we have to raise the bar when itcomes to black friday and with this oneand one black friday you actually turnthe site off yeah we did yeahdisruption disruption i love no i i loveit but tell me about this video herelike this is shot in slow-molike how did it all work yeah yeah so umso well the whole the whole thinking washow are we gonna stand out this yearright and we thought the idea of seeingyour favorite influencersfighting over jim sharp products youknow tackling each other through theboxes you'rewrestling each other exactly you hadryan garcia uhone of the most influential names inboxing right now standing head-to-headwith tatiana suarez one of the hottestfemale ufc fighters like arguing over agymshark hoodie or whatever it was um sofirst of all we knew the concept wouldmake people laughsecond of all we knew we were buildingup this reputation in the industry andwith the consumers that the gym sharksite ischaos on black friday right and wethought how better to actually bringthatthan to bring that to life in real timeand we've all seen those videosthe sort of the data behind it was we'veall seen those videos whereuh the doors open at walmart or asthey're in the ukpeople are saying yeah exactly peopleare punching each other in the face for20off a tv set right and we thought we'veall seen those clips go viral so itstands to reason if we do that with thegymshark athletes we'll get a lot ofshares and we can go viral online soyeah that's where it came fromi love that all right let's show anotherclip here let's roll something elsethis is this is fun man i like this[Applause]so yeah what this is about um there's alot of sort of gym shark imposters onsocial mediauh pretending to be us for for aplethora of reasons to be honest they'reeither trying to sellknock off gymshark products which we weconstantly deal with but you knowlike like you said earlier harleythere's a lot of big brands with a lotof money in the war chest and can't stopthat from happening so we can't eitherum so there's that but the bigger thingand this thisalmost talks to us of protecting ourcommunity is there are there arevery strange people out there who willpretend to be jim shark on social mediaand say we're interested in making you agymshark athleteand asked to send in like photographs ofthem and measurements and can you sendone in your bra and weird things likethatso although it's not us and it hasnothing to do with uswe feel we owe our community somethingright yeah we feel responsible to sayyou know make sure you don't fall forthis nobody from gymshark will everreach out to you in this way if itdoesn't have a blue tick it's not comingfrom usum it's it it's alarming social media isa social media is a great place forbrands like us right and for contentlike this and stuffbut there is also some really darkcorners of it and if we can help combatthat then we absolutely shouldi love that all right let's let's rollone moreso here's how it went down onei wanted to use my student discount codewhich was no problemi just got my code ready earlier in theday to save timetwo i acted fast items are not reservedin your carthree so what happens here is we mixedin the actual campaign content the thethe uh the guy giving the uh news flashthethe bde uh sale has gone live and thenit's here's some stories of peoplewho've successfully shot beforeso blaise who's in the campaign videothat explains how she successfullyshopped during the black friday periodlast year so she says things likeyou know i was logged in i had mystudent discount ready i had did iti knew which one i wanted i did it to mycart and the reason we do that isbecauseto put it into sort of bricks and mortarterms like we mentioned earlier runninginto walmart to get a tv setwe just gave blaze them we just we'regiving the customers the map of wherethe thing they wanted you know what i'msayingyou guys know better than anyone rightthat much traffic is in a website at onetimeis not good for the website so what wewant to try and do is equip theconsumers with as much info on how tosuccessfully shop during the blackfridays out as possibleum and it also it leads to a bettercustomerexperience for them and it alsoalleviates pressure on the customerexperience teams here the social guysyou know i'm saying all that kind ofstuffhey guys is is student discount turnedon or do i need to be logged in canwill things get cleared from my car wetry and front load and answer all thosequestionsbefore that 7 pm go live so by the timeyou're thereyou've got that fastest finger firstmentality they're ready to go they knowwhat they want they're logged inand you know their chances of gettingwhat they want during the sale periodyou know tripled we have one more ithink to showso this is a pretty standard video thatwe've seenyou you've seen this a million times forsuretell us what's going on here so this isthe when the pandemic first hit you hadall these people at a loss of you knowhow to train where to train what totrainum so we turn to our athletes and sayright what we need from you guys ishelp the community they can't get intothe gym so you explaining how to benchpressisn't going to work for them anymore weneed you to flood your social media weneed content that we can repostof how people can get a workout in fromhome because we understand just how muchphysical health is intrinsically linkedto mental health as well right and itwas a dark time for a lot of people outthereand we had all these super inspirationalpeople right from the biggest fitnessinfluencers in the worldwith a way to inspire people and helpthem get a bit of a sweat on from homeand we did that in awe did that in a ton of different waysbut going back to what we talked aboutearliersome of that some of that content wassome of the best performing content weever put out rightum so the the thing you mentioned harleyof almost that defeatist attitude of ohit's okay for jim shark they've alreadygot millions of followers so their stuffcan go viralthis shows that you don't need the highproduction value right you don't needtheyou don't need the creative directorsyou don't need the agencies you don'tneed the storyboards you just needthat great understanding of the painpoints of your customer right now and totry and address it and isisn't that the best part ofentrepreneurship or retail or commerceor brand buildingis that again you don't need to have themost amount of capital the most amountof resourcesyou just have to be authentic andresourceful what this video does andwhat the series of videos doesis that it gives value uh the irony ofus talking about how you needhuge creative budget to make it you knowmake content resonateus we we changed that into home shark ontwitter we screenshotted thatwe put it on instagram and we wrotewe've changed our name to home sharkbecause some of you guys needed toremind me to remind you to stay at homebecause not everyone everybody wasabiding by the rules and that is ourmostliked most engaged piece of content jimshark has ever put out as a brand nowlet me go back tolet me go back to what it took to createthat an understanding of the consumersright and the current situation theyfound themselves inso entered some text on twitterscreenshot post not one camera wasinvolved in the making of our mosthighly engaged piece of content everand i said i said and and you know theysaw that it made them laugh it resonatedwith them they reposted it they saw whatwe didwe helped out the nhs here in the uk andi always i said itin again in the in the the shopifyinterview i did with you guys jasoni stole this thing from the irish primeminister that let them say of us whentimes were at their worst we were ourbestand that's what i had in my entirethat's what i had in my head the entiretime during the pandemicwhat can we do to put our values ondisplay to the world and make them saywhen it all went to jim sharp werethere and jim shark gave us what weneededi'm writing that down when times were attheir worst we were at our bestyeah let them say of us when times wereat their worst we were our best that'ssomething he said when he addressed hisfirst address to the nation and iabsolutely loved it you resonated withme i said it on the jim shark internalpodcast i said it on the interview withshopify andit can't have been more true for jimsharp the amount of stuff we did duringthe pandemic during lockdownand i know that we made people you knowcmos will talk about the ltv of acustomerand if you want to put it into thoseterms i know that the ltv of a bunch ofcustomers went through the roof but whati know more than everor so the more the way i would put it iswe strengthen the family ties between usand the communitymore than we could have you know throughany marketing any contentany traditional stuff we could have donethere is nothingthat builds more trust than when thingsare toughyou showing up in the right way notshowing up in the easy wayyou know but in the right way insteadand usually the right way cost you moretakes more time is more challenging thanthe easy way but it almost always paysoff longer term andand the payoff is is you build brandslike like gymsharkcouldn't agree more so before we we weleave it i want to be respectful of yourtime and and let you get back to workone thing that that i think is reallyimportant is right now there'sit feels like the world is in need ofmore inspiration the world is need inneed of moresupport and and and guidance and helpand careand and you know what's one thing thatyou would say to someone whowants to build something special wantsto build the next gym shark or the nextshopifywhat is something you would say to themtoday so a lot of people know the jimshark story they're inspired by it nowright and they they knowthey know of ben francis the wonderboyentrepreneur he's the new richardbranson and all this stuff butthe one thing i'd say is we're a lotmore scaredof the next 19 year old in the garagethan we are ofthe board at nike or adidas or lululemonor any of those guyswe're a lot more scared of that next kidso you might just be that next kidi love that that's so impactful thankyou so much for spending some time uhwith us noeland uh congrats on all your continuedsuccess and and thanks for just thanksfor being my friend thanks for being afriend of shopify'sand uh and and i love that you folksnever make any small plansand you continue to inspire me that'sthe reason why all of us at shuffle iget up every day is to helpmore people build the next gym sharksand uh it's it's amazinglovely it wouldn't be gymshark withoutshopify thanks

do you want to learn how to pick somenew leggings do you know what to lookfor in new leggings do you know what'sgonna make leggings look awesome on youor terrible on you and I don't mean likethe 20-something perfect fitness modelgirls on Instagram I mean moms like meand maybe you if you wanna learn andwatch this video and by the end you'regoing to know just what to look for andwhat to avoid at all costs I promise andfor the best fitness and lifestyle tipsplease subscribe below and remember tohit the alarm bell so that you getnotified every time I put up new videoslike this that help you figure out somecool life hacks for mom so I'm some workout some fitness tips nutrition tips andall sorts of stuff in between okay tipnumber one you have to look at the seamsthe seams are so key so depending onyour build you're gonna want a wider ormore narrow waistband I think mostflattering is a higher waist and youwant to see if there's a front seam anda back seam and these are reallyimportant the back seam is your bestfriend because it's going to give yousome separation back there which reallyhelps give you a flattering look and thefront seam sometimes it's essential whenyou have the back seen that would makesense but that isn't always the case soI have one pair I'll show you guys thathave a back seen but no front seam thatis like genius the front seams sometimescan give you you know your beloved cameltoe situation nobody really wants butsometimes it's worth the price ofadmission for the effect in the back sothat's tip number one these are my veryfavorite black leggings there from Spanxit's like the only thing I have fromSpanx because I hate compression stuffit makes me crazy and I don't think itlooks good on me but these are likeamazingwinter tight because they're prettythick but I have been known to wear themin the summer with like heels and alittle top because they're suck you forgoing outthey are that holy grail where they havethe back seam and a little contour herebut no friends seem very tough to dovery cool super long mine are let's seean extra small and these also hold upvery well they're beautiful with theirgreat example of why seams really matterbecause this might give you the benefitof bothyes seam in the back no seam in frontokay tip number two compression isn'talways your friend so especially if youmaybe have a couple towns you'd like tolose or you are just kind of a biggerframe you're going to assume that highcompression is what you want that isn'talways the case and I for instancereally don't like compression there'sjust sort of the sweet spot of lightcompression that I think looks good onme but just bear that in mind whenyou're looking at them look at thisspandex percentage and just feel themlike pull on them and feel if they aregoing to really squash you in becausesometimes that kind of for me it makesme have like no but at all which is notthe look I'm going forit's all pretty hard-earned for my creamso think about the compression levelokay don't assume you're gonna love itif it's super tight and it's gonna justsuck you in that might be what you wantbut it isn't necessarily the mostflattering nd GTM my very favoritetights ever I would not know about thesetights without a video like this that Iwatched a while back so hence my passionfor legging hauls these are incrediblethey are exactly right from my body theyhave a compressive high waistband andthen they have a very low compressionleg with beautiful detailing it's kindof tone on tone so it's not tooobnoxious and these are like a forestgreen which I never would have boughtbefore but I thinklike really pretty on they have theirsignature foodie contour and a lot ofextra fabric here because you'resupposed to hike them up girlsdefinitely in the back and if you're notdoing it just know pretty much everybodyelse is so just do it and then you knowfix the front up a little bit and justgo with it because it looks I think it'sso good in the back okay for tip numberthree it doesn't have to be black I knowthat's most people save spot but Ireally think that lighter coloredleggings are more flattering especiallyif you're kind of an athletic or curviergirl because you want to highlight yourshape you don't just want it all toblend in and look like nothing youreally want to show all that hard workor show like your god-given gifts butdon't hide them away so be open-mindedabout color scheme and I'll show you awhole range but I personally preferlight colored leggings I think they justthey just look best can't do a legginghaul without something sharp becausethey're so awesome these are theirseamless align no these are their vitalsseamless and I got this kind of heathergray which I think counts as a lightcolor they have very cool detailing theyhave no front seam they're seamless andin the back they don't have a scene butthey have kind of like a pressed Ridgewhich is like a like a shadow of a seambut it helps it definitely helps giveyou some separation they have the selfbootie contouring here very subtle inthis model and some cool atom detaildown the legs love these the brand newis really small they're amazing and allthe tights are tried on today our squatproof by the way even though I didn'treally talk about that as one of my tipsbut I'm just thinking about like overalllook of your leggings these are amazingokay tip number four you want to againassess the height of the waistband sosometimes it can look really pretty tohave a very wide waistband and someI can kind of cut you off I'm a reallyshort torso so I need to go high-waistedbut then the way that I pair it with thetop really matters because it can makeme look like I have no waist like it'slike boobs and hips and nothing inbetween so think about the waistbandthink about whether or not you want tobe able to roll it down think about ifit cuts into you that's never great andjust kind of feel it because a lot ofthese sites have a different compressionaround the waist which I love and I'llget into you really want to be thinkingabout how it's gonna look through yourmiddle versus how it's gonna lookthrough your legs so you might want tohire compression in the middle of theday so for instance on these Lululemonaligns the seam is kind of see how it'skind of contoured down very subtle thisis a great kind of starter contour seambut they have a back seam and a frontseam the back seam is awesome reallyhelpful and the front seam can get youin a little bit of trouble but not toobad on these so these are you know someof my most beloved tights and they havea million beautiful colors they're veryexpensive but they last and you justdon't want to like beat them up too muchbecause they're a little bit fragile butif you take good care of them in thelast two a very long time and you'llkeep pulling them again and again andagain okay the last tip tip number fiveis to look at the detailing some typesnowadays have really cool contouringfeatures that may look scary but reallycan make all the difference in youlooking amazing in your tights so I likelike a subtle bootie contours sometimesif I'm feeling it I'll go for like abooty scrunch I know it's scary and thenthey have like you know sometimes havedetailing down to the legs the kind ofreally highlight if you have muscularlegs like me you can make you can kindof show them off you know you don't haveto put them in black tights and justpretend they're not there like youlike hey look at these legs now we havethe out philippe halo leggings I didHolland nieces well these are also alight color as I said these have a verycompressive waistband these are probablyhigher compression for me but they havelots of fun details and a lot of likemesh paneling see and they have bootycontour that is not see-through thankGod you can see there the patternchanges and they have like an e panelbut they just look really cool on andthey they're highlighting your sort ofmuscles beautifully and they are abeautiful blue trying them I am a formerfitness model many years ago I carriedfor baby as I have three live births andyou know I've gone up and down the scalemultiple times in my life so I lovehelping my friends and clients gettowards a higher level of fitness ifthat's their goal or just a generalsense of well-being and basically I

[Music]what's up guys and welcome back to mychannel sorry for sounding a littlenasally today I'm a little bit sick alsojust chopped off like all of my hairthis is the shortest it's been since Iwas like six years old so super excitingand this say my forehead I explained inmy giveaway video also I'm running agiveaway right now so if you want toenter that go just go see my last videoand give it an enter basin ship sharkand little em'ly involved so probablywant to go do that but anyway this videois a review of Jim sharks new camoseamless collection they actually wasn'tgoing to order this but then like twodays passed and I like was just likecouldn't stop thinking about it and itwas so pretty so I just hadn't orderedit and I got it in the jade green sagegreen color and it is so prettyspoiler alert guys I love this set Iwill ask always be totally honest withyou guys in this video on any thingsthat I find wrong with the set this isnot sponsored I'm not the Joe sharpathlete so there's no reason why I wouldbe promoting this product if I didn'tactually like it so let's I starttalking about it first things first theprices so this is something that reallybothered me because this is the mostexpensive gym shark set there is to dateI mean sorry if I'm wrong on that butfrom my experience the most expensiveleggings that I purchase on Jim shark inthe past were $55 and I believe that'sthe energy seamless and the flawlessknit which I did a review of but theseleggings are these cameras use leggingsare $60 and these are US dollars I knowthat in different countries differentprices so sorry about that but if you'refrom the US the leggings are $60 and thesports bra is $45 and I think the top isalso $45 so if you want to get the fullset you're nearing about $150 and I justthat's just a lot of money a lot of youguys have been asking for Dukes for thisand I will be doing a new video comingup but these are super expensive but youare if you are willingto invest in some activewear I do thinkthese are very high quality but it is alittle upsetting that Jim shark keepsraising their prices because I mean Ithink that flex liking sorry the $30range in 30 to 40 of these are 16 sothat's a lot of money the cameraseamless collection has the leggings thesports bras and the long-sleeve croptops so there are no like full-lengthshirt options if you don't like showingany stomach at the gym for us tallpeople wearing a crop top and leggingscan still be showing a lot of torso soif you don't like to show any torso thenthis collection doesn't have like a fullcherie option for you the colors arelavender gray sage green which I haveand then black so talking about theleggings so in the material of theseleggings I'm just gonna read it becauseI don't feel like memorizing it's anylon polyester a lot of same blend andthe bio seamless and energy seamlessalso by Jim shark are also nylonpolyester a lot same blends butdifferent percentages so it isdefinitely a different material and iflink feels like a different materialthis is definitely one of Jim sharkslike thicker fabrics compared to theflawless knit which was like paper thinbut still actually mostly squat proofthese are definitely super thick thewaistband is super thick it feels likemore like a winter and leggings puttingit on I don't know if like that like itlooks like anything but like so youcould tell it's like a stickit's definitely a big fabric let me gocompare it to that ombre and it's likelet's compare some waist bands so ifyou're wondering how the waist bandscompared to others in terms of heightI'd say that looks pretty darn closeokay so it's the same height this is thecamo and this is a Jim shark ombreseamless and the waist bands are theexact same height so if you are lookingfor the same high-rise as an energyseamless by the way these do hit meabout like right above my belly buttonas you see in the video but the waistbands are different this is the ombreseamless and the ribbing is slightlymore spread out and you can also seeit's just like a thinner more flimsywaist band to be honest I really don'tlike the Jim shark ombre seamlesswaistband but this waistband as you cansee Debhas a little more thickness to it alittle more structure the ribbing iscloser together see farther closertogether and I justI trust that these would not stretch outas much as the hombre seamless that it'svery flimsy and in terms of the vitalseamless the waistband okay this iswhere the waistband starts so it is thetiniest bit shorter than the gym sharkvital seamless waistband but as you cansee the ribbing is a little closer thisis more closely ribbed and this is alsoclosely ribbed but it also it looksthicker as you can see it looks like aslightly thicker waistband it definitelyfeels a lot thicker then the vitalseamless waistband which I also don'tload the vital seamless waistband thatthis waistband feels really good so it'sthicker more compressive and it's notgoing to stretch out as much in terms offabrics I really it's definitely notlike the vital seamless if I allseamless has a very slick texture almostand so we'll just get rid of that one interms of material composition the camout and the hombre seamless are verysimilar but if you hear let's see alittle close-up this so this is a Morrowtexture and this I can't it's hard totell but tomorrow because it is camo butit really doesn't look like marl and itfeels more cottony than the hombreseamless for sure so definitely more ofa cottony texture so the most similarfabric to the camo seamless is the gymshark flex but I feel like it is stillthicker than the gym truck flex the Flexis a pretty thick fabric but I reallyfeel like the camo is thicker than thatso it's more like a winter legging butin terms of like rut you know rubbingyour fingers along it how does itactually feel the gym shark flex is theclosest fabric to the camo seamless forsuresometimes the Flex can be a littleflimsy this is definitely thicker so itwill give you a little more shape forsure also for the seams I'm a dancer soI need to be able to stretch andeverything and these seams felt verystretchy some other Jim shark seams canbe really annoying and like very stiffbut use actually felt very stretchy andit just has thatsimple little gusset crotch in casey'all were wondering via the seams aresuper stretchy in diapersit definitely has somewhat of acompression feel but in the waistbandwhere it's super thick I feel like awhole doing really well but I didn'tfeel like it squished my butt at allwhich is pretty rare for like acompression to my game I feel like alittle like bootie contour detail alsohelps with thatbut I really didn't feel like I was likelike being squished down it also didn'tshow any cellulite which is great so Ifeel like these are very thick like eggsand they hide imperfections very welland like hold you in where you want tobe held in but I didn't feel like mybutt was like squished down which I knowthat is a pet peeve of mine and someother of you guys as well in compared tothe flawless net which I just reviewedthese definitely hide things a lotbetter like you could not really seeunderwear lines you couldn't seecellulite you couldn't see like I don'tknow if anyone else has that little likedouble but you know it's like a littlecrease and I mean he's not pleased we'rejust gonna be real right now thathappens to some of us and that you can'tsee that on these leggings but I believeyou could on the othersthese come in size extra small to largelike almost everything else Jim shark Iwear a size small and everything Jimshark and he's fit exactly like anyother small so I say definitely true tosize the waistband is ribbed so it'sbasically a very similar waistband to alot of other generic leggings but itfeels a little more structured like andI haven't worn it for long enough totell if it's going to stretch out butfor some reason I feel like it's notgoing to stretch out because it's notthe same fabric as the hombre seamlesswhich they do stretch out like nothingelse and I could see a little bit ofstretching out with these they alsodon't have that top band it's theclassic the classic Jewish arc waistband very flattering but I could seethese stretching out a little bit butthey have not stretched out for me yetasks for the details as you can see theJim shark logo on these is very subtlewhich I love I sometimes feel like Jimshark really like over logos but you cansee it's just like it's very subtly inthe fabric like it's it's it's notraised or anything they literally justwroteshark-like within the cama which i thinkis so cool like a really really gooddesign idea for them and for the firsttime ever I think they have a bootyscrunch and this isn't like a bootyscrunch that's like wow those leggingsaren't up her butt you know it's likeit's so subtle and it's like it's onlyabout like an inch in length and it'sreally just made by like a bunch oflittle like it looks like embroider IIstitches it looks like little embroiderystitches and sometimes with the seamlesslegging your butt could kind of get likelost in it just because it's just likeahit adds no definition or anything andthis kind of just like brings it in andit's like okay her butt is still theremaybe that's part of the reason why Ididn't compress my butt because likethey have this little stitching and itreally helps like enhance but from faraway it doesn't look like it's bootyscrunch butt wouldn't like but it lookslike you have more like definition inyour butt not just like Yuna but youknow I'm saying not just like one monthand the camo is very delicate and I feltlike they chose good colors so it's notlike a bright green with like a reallylight color it's like all around likevery subtle I feel like from very faraway you might not even know it's camobut I really like how they designed thecamo and it's not like that pixel IIlike military camo it's more of like asmooth like I don't know they're kind ofblobs you see what it is you see andthey also have a little ribbed bottom ofthe legging and these are a full-lengthon me I'm five nine but I have a longertorso as of course that's opposed tolegs in these hit just about like rightabove my little ankle joint thing thatmake sense but totally full-length on meso there's a squat crudeness I feel likeit's hard to tell almost because of thecamo it kind of like this proof I don'tknowbut looking at the video of me andsquatting I'd say they're like I get alook at 9n attends I give it like a 9out of 10 squat richness I feel likethere's like a tiny bit of Sheernesswhat do you like really are leaning overbut it's like not too bad but for themost part I'd say these areand you should feel comfortable going tothe gym in these you're not gonna seeanything I was wearing like a similarcolored underwear to this but I reallycouldn't see anything in my squad testin terms of camel toe I feel like theseleggings are so much thicker than likean ombre seamless that they'recamouflages the camel toe a lot betterthis you still do you still do get alittle bit of like the single camel butyou're definitely not getting any doublecamel which is very important I feellike that's the worst kind of camel toeit's hard to take it like the doublecamel sometimes when you have a seamlesslegging because there's no like seamgoing up there you know but there'sdefinitely still a little bit but I saythese are probably the best Jim sharkleggings to date that have camouflagethe camel toe just because the fabric isso thick and sweat proof I can't imagineyou'd notice really any sweat in theseunless you are like really really sweatybut because of the camouflage like ifyou were going to sweat a little bitit'll probably just blend into the camoeffect you know like it'll just looklike one of the darker like darkerblotches instead of one of the lighterblotches so if you're a nice sweatyperson I feel like these would be goodbecause you could really you could getreally get away with a lot of sweat withnot very many people noticing justbecause of both just because of thedesign and to these sports grass so thesports bra is the same material as theleggings it has this cute little like Idon't know what you'd call this but kindof like a little fold over like rap rapleg effect in the front and in the backit has this like I don't know what youwould call this but kind of like alittle keyhole design they really put alot of thought into the design of thisbra I think it's like really unique interms of a sports bra instead of justlike a regular sports bra but if we likeI felt like that is another story aboutthat but those are the details and italso says Jim shark very subtly likeengraved in the fabric like not raisedor anything in the back tomb and then ithas the tiny little shark logo on thefront which they probably could havedone without because they have this butyeah those are the details of the sportsbra and they also haveribbing at the bottom of the sports bramuch like the waistband of the leggingso I really thought this would be likezero support at all because most jimtransports bras are absolutely zero supportbut this I actually would say this onethis is a medium support it is likethere's still some jiggling going on butI felt more supported than like a gymshark ombre seamless sports bra which islike really nothing nothing to bragabout let's talk for a moment about yoursharks sports bras shall we I feel likea lot of the gym shark athletes who arethe primary reviewers of the gym sharkGoods like because they get the gymshark items early they don't they canreview everything before people buythose people watch they'll often saythat gym shark is like a look like likea medium support but most of thesepeople have either breast implants orreally small chests which is fine but Ifeel like if the average bra size in theUnited States at least the average cupsize is a double D I just feel likethey're not really catering to allaudiences I do have a larger chest and Imostly don't even bother with gym sharksports bras I really got this just forthe review and I plan on returning itbecause it's not something I can wear tothe gym if you have a larger chest thisshows a lot like there was spillage outto the side there's a lot of cleavage itreally felt like a push-up bra and Ijust don't feel comfortable going to thegym and showing that much cleavage andthat much is my body if you want to dothat that it's like totally go you but Ireally don't feel comfortable like ohI'll wear a sports front of the gym butI really don't want there to be likemajor cleavage I feel like that's justlike not what I want to do and also mostof gyms export routes are so low supportthey have seriously like one line ofsupportive sports bras so everythingelse is like you can't what you can'thave a supportive sports bra to matchwith your gym sharks at because theydon't make them for women with largerchest which just really bothers me orlike maybe for a collection for one soyou don't make like a spaghetti strapsports bra and you make like something alittle more supportive or it'shaving removable pads uuk build the padinto the bra so I really wish Jim sharkwould start making their bras a littlemore like inclusive to women of allchest sizes and and stop doing theremovable pads and actually like putpads in that's my rant on ginger sportsbras the pass on this didn't bother mequite as much as some of the other gymshark paths but I don't obviously butsince this material is a more sturdythicker material than a lot of other gymshark fabrics it did provide a littlemore support I also got this in a smallI don't know if I mentioned I gotta geta small and everything I also got thisin a small and because of that it reallyjust like squished my boobs down which Ifeel like is why I was able to give somesupport if I got a medium I don't thinkthat this would be supportive at all butjust keep it in mind if you have alarger test you will be showing a lot ofcleavage in this and if you're not downfor that maybe just get the long-sleevedtop instead but you have a smaller chestor you want to show some cleavage go forthis bra because it's actually I it'ssuper cute and I wish that I was able towear it I have I definitely have friendswho would look amazing in this and a lotof people would look amazing in this soif you were in that boat I'd say thisfourth bra is definitely super cute andI really don't have any other complaintsabout it I think it's a super uniquedesign and I haven't really seen anyother sports bras like this so yeah thatis basically all I have to say about thegym sharkcam a seamless set I got thismostly to review but I really want tokeep it looking so cutebut I have a lot of gym clothes also alot of you guys think I have like somany dingy clothes but I returned likehalf of things that I buy or I sell themso I really don't have as many as youthink but I will make a liking videocollection by collection video coming upsoon because I know then I love you wantto see that yes don't forget

hey YouTube back here with another videoand today I'm going to be answering somequestions like questions that would findthat are most frequently asked to peopleand just cover the basics I know youhear it on every channel to be answeringit from my point of view on mostfrequently kind of asked questions youfind in the fitness community how manyof my perspective and then I'm going tokind of talk a little bit of why I thinkthis going to go ahead and knock outsome simple questions a couple of aboutmeeting real quick we're using ipad hereto write down so i don't ramble off toomuch i am 21 years old I know I look alot younger I can thank my baby face vetand I've been lifting for about two twoand a half years now I say two two and ahalf because I would say the first halfof the time but I started lifting I wasdoing more like full body workouts likejust getting used to the motions andwasn't taking it as seriously as Ishould have like how I have been thebest few years 5 10 5 10 I wish I wassix foot a younger brother 6 foot whenolder brothers the same height my dad istaller hopefully a grow a couple inchesi would love to be six feet awesome andmy current body fat level right now Idon't know last time I had it measuredwas when I took my personal trainingcourses and that was back in Septemberof last year and I was eighteen percentthere I was cutting up time I am cuttingright now I'm dieting down and tell andthat's a little bit information about menow I'm going to go and go over somefrequently asked questions or somethingthat you might beif you're just now getting into weightlifting what you have in weightliftingif you've been waiting the pig a whilethis might not pertain to you but it'sthe most common question that I gotplease so weird at a sporting goodsstore and then wanting to start weightlifting do they need gloves you needweightlifting clothes and basically thisdepends and I say it depends because youcan see people that go out to like homedepot by those gardening gloves or get adollar tree if you have one or dollargeneral whatever your dollar goodstories and you can get the like ofgardening gloves they work just the samebut they're a little bit thicker andthen look torquay to wear to say apublic gym if you have your own home gymthis might not be an issue for you sodisregard that but you usually go toyour sporting goods store you find liketo be a pair that's eleven dollars andthen it'll be one eyes a little bit morepadding so it's like twenty dollarsadatha brands on it might be $22 buy abrand like the under armour going 24.9depending and if you're going to go forweightlifting love and I recommend it ifyou're just starting or if you have thatwould think a little bit and your handsare hurting from like saving grip on thebar I would go ahead and look for aglove that does not have stitching herethis the palm area of your hand likeright around here if you do I've noticedfrom the Paris to the iphone the past apharbinger or Nike or under armour not in10 Americans they don't have a stitch inthere from pairs of iphone but that partwill always rip you know might be sixmonths down the road but it's kind ofrip and then you're going to buy anotherpair of gloves and that's going to costyou another twenty twenty thirty dollarsyou know what's the point I personallyhave not been wearing gloves in the pastyear and a half my calluses are prettythick and I have a bad habit of pickingat them but I haven't worn any callusesI do not do any power licking of thesort a more bodybuilding if you couldn'ttell thank youthat's my really opinion on gloves justthis question really covers if you're ina dinner advanced intermediate whateverthe type of equipment that you need nowI would always recommend black pair ofshoes whether they be bands or chucksavoid the Chuck to generate like thesecond generation later bought out byNike so they use the new lunar foam inthem thinking more comfortable and thenut they're not flat anymore I mean theyare but the cushion just it's not goodfor squatting if you canI got my gym bag here and what i haveand i bought a pair of a deep hoursthese guys right here and hope they areyou can see that they're flat are theyrequired absolutely not I just watchingsome chucks I bought those time ago istill wear in the gym I love my chucksnow this also is bringing it the secondpiece of equipment and that's aweightlifting belt now I'm sure you'veseen everyone got those fancy class onesand you get these traditional style hereand you see the velcro ones avoid thevelcro I wouldn't recommend it so whatyou really want to look for in the beltis how thick it is that's really goingto determine the comfort level beforeyou and how you like it I prefer alittle bit thinner like you saidmillimeter brushes like a 11 or 13 whichyou can certainly find and then on thetopic of like leg day kind of thinksgonna get a pair of knee sleeves anytraps are annoying and irritating to dowith so if you can deal with that that'sfine I personally owned a pair of eastleaves I have pad wraps in the passagethat I did not like them so these areour from your deck lifting I can seethat and it came up on this one and Ibought these about i bought theseabout two months ago and i absolutelylove them i will drop a link down belowin the description box i think you couldpick these up right now for about fortydollars 48 care and this is the sevenmillimeter like this and the reason irecommend it is to keep your knees veryworn measure yourself with likemeasuring tape to order your like rightin the middle go ahead and order sizedown but if you're like half the topsize of the chart like I meant it at thetop medium and I just went ahead orderedimmediately said I would have gone smallbut I'm going to be bulking too early sothey might become too tight I don't wantto order another pair and then lastthing that I would think someone wouldneed in their gym equipment if you don'twear gloves and you want an option to itlike you are doing it back so you'redoing or pulled a or back day or if youwant to call it and you don't have thegrip strength where you do but on thatthird fourth fifth set you know yourscripts getting out you can totally getthis extra reps if you had the gripstrength I'm going to recommend likegetting a pair of Bursa grips yeah righthere awesome and what they do our stuffat one on yours just putting right herethen tight and maybe this basically youcan wrap the bar around here you can dopull-ups you knew your Rose anything youwant wrap it on here you don't even haveto use it all the time if you just wantprotect your palm cuz you don't want towear a glove you can totally just do itlike this as well I like these becausethey're stiff but I used to have a pairtheir flimsy they got the job done butthey were just irritating atime-consuming justsure them the bar and may God be asefficient as possible so i will also puta link for these in the description boxbelow everything will be in amazon ibelieve they're all prime shipping so ifyou have that take advantage of it nowi'm going to talk about a couple piecesof equipment that aren't necessary tohave but you know they totally help oneit would be resistance bands of a sortof interesting a resistance band forwarming not stretching great i'drecommend one and then a weight beltlike dipping belt if you want to addsome way to your chest dips or yourtricep dips or pull ups this is a greateasy way to add weight and be safe aboutit this is a harbinger I will also put alink to this description box below Iwouldn't recommend adding wait untilyour form is good or you can get atleast 12 or three sets easily none ofthat covers it for equipment wise youdon't need a whole lot to get in the gymif you're just starting off I feltminimum developdinner it's nice their place you knowanything herniating out of your stomachit's not kind of fun now the nextquestion is what kind of clothes shouldyou wear the gym and the simple answeris whatever you're comfortable wearingnow keep in mind you should understandwhat your gym allows you to wear somegyms SE nota stringers can't wear it toomuch skin particularly for the males andI don't like to be nickel banged in theeyes you know a little annoying some gymrequired how but type of clothes youshould wear ain't brand does not matterit doesn't and you want to wearsomething that is not be tight but looseand is comfortable is breathable rubbermaterial that whips the way your sweatkeeps you nice and cool and so then alsobring it means the topic of you see allthese people wearing like Jim shark andif you're wanting yourself should youbuy some ginger clothing and that answeris completely up to you do I think it'snecessary to wear like these brandthings Jim shark on our Nike if youfollow Christian guzmán or Nikki blackowner or any of the Alpha Lee teambecause you notice i am wearing an alphaleague shirt and i love their missionstatement i love the whole idea behindthe company i especially love thatthey're from houston texas as myself andi love to support another Texan when ican and i one day hope to go to thealpha legion that's a whole differenttangent and hopefully is youtube videoand the reason I wear it well the guy asI just mentioned I hope one day to besponsored or at least you know helppromote the company in a good manner ina good viewpoint just by wearing theirclothes Oh promote the image of outbleep and I'll drop a link to theirmission statement in the districtso you can read it I personally myselfwant to purchase jib shark and the wholereason I say it depends you know youshould purchase it if you want to dolike clothing if you like the company goahead and buy the shirts father's upyeah it's very pricey you know and youknow that's what you get behind the mainpay that extra dollar idea behind a nameyou know whether it be nike under armouradidas or you know how police in my casewith jim chartered whatever company youpay that extra dollar for one qualityinto the names behind the company orbehind the shirt which is like and webuy these shirts when you wear into thegym you know that maybe somebody elsealso knows about that company they gowow they're wearing you know whateverand that's kind of like a boost to yourmorale you know give it a boost your egoa little bit too but you get that wholenew level of confidence that you arewearing something that you wouldn't haveworn before you started weightlifting orsomething you know you just lookdifferent to changed your style and thatto you can completely change your wholeperspective like it can boost yourconfidence it can increase your workoutperformance temporarily you know whethera placebo or not you know you boost yourworkout performance regardless you feelbetter and you just kill that work outyou know the first time wearingsomething and I knew that a lot of timesI you know if I'm noticing some of myequipment that i mentioned earlier isnow although you know how shaped I wouldsay and I buy a new piece of equipmentand I'm excited to use that like when ifirst got these shirts i was excited towear this the gym I could not wait toget inside and kill that work out findsomething you like Rep it excited towear it till that work out the nexttopic morning or is supplements whetheror not you should take them now all pinsthings on your situation they getsupplemented protein powder I think youshould take a protein shake if youcannot get it from your whole foods ifyou're just looking for a simple proteinI would recommend like a whey protein Imyself use gold standard protein byoptimum nutrition and i'll put myprotein down to the description as welland you know i take it because i can'tget all my protein from whole foods so igot do the supplement it into my dietthis whole idea behind supplements it'sto supplement not to become your onlysource so that's very important so ifyou just worked out a little bro sciencebut i always like to have a good amountof protein in my system right after workout my post workout and i also comesinto pre workouts take it if you want ityou know if you want anything a prettyworkouts going to help you go ahead andtake it make sure you do a littlereading behind the pre-workout firstbefore you get it i know your caffeinetolerance because when i first started ibought this thing from labrada it'scalled supercharged two point oh I flewoff the chain my heart was I didyou know and it was kind of fun I waslight of heart when it took it and solook up behind pre-workout right nowI've ready got a high tolerance to preworkout so I am cycling now a biggesttopic is creatine and what kind ofcreatine you should be taking certainpeople react to creatine differentlysome people are floated from it somepeople feel no bloating you know what soever and I personally don't get loadedfrom creatine so I take five grams everysingle day every day don't you knowcycle it you'll need a loaded five gramsa day you're covered for your female I'dsay three grams 55 really want to it butrecommended three and you see likecreatine monohydrate which is you shouldbe using if you notice you react Iwonders there's all sorts of cretins outthere and you might react to differenteach one come on we want to look out fordecreasing my hydrate super cheap canget about 200 sightings from op tonutrition like fifteen dollars so greatprice and then there's beta alaninecreatine beta-alanine are the two moststudied supplements and they're the mostproven to work and those are the twosupplements that I would recommendpersonally especially creatinebeta-alanine basically reduces thelactic acid buildup that you would getafter work out you know we first cutyou're like really sore beta alaninesupposed to help you leave that andincrease the recovery process I'll putsome articles in the description as welland then a quick one will talk about ismusic I have my own music playlist ify'all interested in my music playlist Iwill also put that in the descriptionand then y'all can listen to what Iwasn't doing well but it's going to beon Spotify and 501 I want to talk aboutis certain scenarios scenarios that Iwould say go see a doctor to see aphysician go see someone with a highermedical training you are experiencingany pain like if they're liking yourelbows joints go see a doctor don'tdebate it don't question don't go askthem the biggest guy in the gym or yourbest buddy who likes to work out don'task them they're going to all give youdifferent answers the simple one is goto your doctor that you can don't riskit if you're working out you notice yourshoulders hurting whether the from badfor more from a previous injury thatyou've heard past go see a doctor listento your body if you're hurting whileyou're working out stop crying we'regonna break something you're going tosnap something go see a doctor andyou'll hear a lot of other people if youask Miss conspecific license you knowwhether it be a bigger youtubers fitnessmodel whatever they're all I say itdepends and by depends it means go see adoctor as they are not medically ortrained or inclined to answer thosespecific kind of questions

recommend check it out allright guys now just let me give you alittle disclaimer I'm not gonna try andpush any products on you I'm not gonnatry and sell you anything which I don'trecommend anything they went by myselfand anything that wouldn't I don't thinkyou would benefit from okay you'll seepretty much every other Fitness YouTubechannel try push products on you try andgive the you the discount codes and tryand get you to buy this stuff now Ireally am just going to give you myhonest opinion I don't like something ifI don't agree with it I'm gonna let youknow okay I'm not going to try and pushyou something just to get an extra saleor just to make an extra like one or twopounds I'm not going to do it okay butat the same time if I do like somethingI'm gonna recommend it to you guys okayif it saves you money if it benefits youI'm going to recommend it to okay forexample in the plastic recommended gymshark gym where okayI'm not associated with them I don't getpaid to recommend them I don't have anylike sort of association with them atall but I think they make good qualityclothing and I think that it's somethingthat you've got to want to wear stylishthey have a great range and it's goodquality material okay now the only thingI will say about gym shark is personallyI've found that the clothes shrink I'vefound this room probably almost everyclothing company in allsee but that's not like that's notputting on a super high temperature washthat system like a 30 degree wash andthat's not put it in a tumor drive but Ifound I've had two pairs of joggers andthey're both shrunk okay I've bought alarge and they've ended up shrinking andnow that basically knee bashes but yeahnot saying anything else bad about themthere isn't anything else bad to sayabout themquality is top-notch great to train inyou can't really you're not really goingto beat that quality in my opinion on apair of joggers it is quite pricey butagain for the quality that's what youhave to expect to pay more for goodquality okay but now my protein haveactually sent me this hoodie okay firstimpressions this is probably a helmetscreams coming of a known by spin okaythis is probably the most comfortablethis hoodie most comfortable list isthat words the most comfortable hoodiethat I've probably ever worn um I wasactually really surprised because it'sactually one of the cheaper cheaper Rampiece of clothing on my protein I thinkit's less than about 20-pound I'm nottoo sure of the exact price obviouslyyou can check it out if you want to butthis this material it's not super thickit's like it's in between like it'sobviously thicker than a t-shirt butit's not like a super thick hoodiethat's gonna weigh down it feels quitelightweight but the material it's socomfortable I'm not I'm not I'm sure onthe exact a blend of the material I knowit's not a lot of hundred percent cottonbut it is like quite a stretch stretchsort of like slimline fit to it but yesso comfortable obviously got a hood butthe thing I'm most impressed with it isthe price point okay now I'm a personthat I don't go out and spend like tonsof money on clothing okay if I seesomething that I like I'll get it butI'll get it the cheapest price possibleif there's a discount code I'll use itfor example when I bought all my gymsock where I bought that with the twentypercent discountthat was almost a year ago now that'swhen I bought that and with this with myprotein and gear with their clothing Ithink you can actually buy it all yearround and not have to worry about theprice because I think it is that wellpriced that that's why it's somethingthat a push because because it'ssomething that I would use because it'ssomething that I think that it'sfeasible for you guys and is obviouslygoing to benefit you because it has sucha good price point that it is somethingthat you're going to be able to affordat the end of the day so when you havegreat quality and when you have a greatprice point that is when I'm going torecommend stuff to you guys okay nowwe'll be definitely ordering the joggersthe sort of like the the track pants forthese because I've got a friend who'sactually got them James if you saw thethe meetup vlog with him thieves got thethe joggers and they are so comfortableis said so I'm going to get the the onlyat the black pair to match this hoodieand yes it's going to be the great tracksuit and yeah but like I said not ontime pushing thing on you guys I'm justgiving you my honest opinion and if youdon't save yourself some money of courseuse the link in the description and usethe discount code to go with that okayokay so along with the hoodie they sentme a pair of training socks obviouslyit's not it's not like a regular pair ofsocks but I'm just gonna put these onand let you know what I think of themokay okay so it's a fairly plain blacksock and it's it's got the my proteinand broidered in it's not just theirprinted I'm subtly stitched into thematerial but yeah I think the the ideaof these is the comfort and the wear ofthem not the actual design so I'm justgonna head go ahead and put these onagain okay so then whether it's film islooking at my feet or looking at my faceokay but I'm just going to show you themon my feet real quick so yeah again it'sgot the my protein stitch around theback it's actually got a an hour and anhour for the correct feet to wearthey're the right way around but yeahfirst impressions are that my feet ofwall now is there cold day and haven'tbeen wearing in a sucks but you haven'tfeet warm now thing is they feel likewhite tighten the foot and but not somuch that they feel like they cuttingoff the circulation but feel great towear obviously it's a pair of socks whatwhere companies say a great deal aboutthem but yeah I think it's I think theyunderstand your feet and I think thereshould be good to were training alsothink they could could be good to travelin you know like going on a plane andwhatnot some people especially me theyare get like uncomfortable feet I can'tsit in the same position but these looklike they are going to be prettycomfortable to travel in so we get ratsflying next time flying should be to alay I'll try and let you know then whatthey like but yeah quite nice socksprobably be wearing these to trainingnow usually wear some hot dog orhamburger socks I'm wearing these theyare really quite nice and quite a nicefit so again if you want them links indescription unfortunate to buy them it'sentirely up to you guys okay give thisvideo a like leave a comment down belowsubscribe if you

typically i wear a size smalland then in pants i wear a size small orsize 226 so that's typically like mymeasurementsi've always been this way but i goteverything the size smallthe band on it is super fitted which ireally wanted especially since i workout from home nowjust because of coping and everythingalong those lines i do a lot of highimpact workouts and a lot of high impactyoga that requires me to do a lot ofdifferent positionsand sometimes my pants like roll downand i want something that's kind ofstationary around my waistso this band is insanebut these are the first pants that i gotand then to match it i got the yellowvital seamless 2.0 and this is one ofthe new launchesi did see that they had an animal printlaunch that happenedlast week and i was like i need to seeif i like these clothes before i like goand get thosebut it still has like that little ribtexture that is on itbut it's like a lightweight crop top soi do have a blacksports bra on an underneath this is justlike an airy like yogai have a low impact bras because i'm notheavy chested so i can get awaywith low impact bra so that's what thisone isbut it's a really nice cropped fit and idon't have many crop things becausei'm not the type of person that likescrop stuff i feel like i kind of grownout of that face and i never actuallypartaked in the phrasebut i thought that since 2021i am resting i'm also just doing thingsthat make me happyand i've always wanted to like wear cutecrop tops to like work outin i was like girl why don't you just doit sothat's why i decided to get two croptops so if that is anything for you guysjust do it feel confident in it soum i got some crop tops so we shall seeif i like them buti liked this one as well as the otherone that i picked up because it's alittle bit longer so it's not going toexpose like all of my goodiesit's just going to expose like a littlebit of where the high waist in the croptop meet so it's just like a little skinpoking outbut i like this and it also has a littlefinger hole which i feel likeis collect and then for the next littleset that i goti think that this is what's the name ofit this is the adapt tomorrow seamlesslongit's in a size small as well but what ireally like about this one it is wayheavier than this one i feel like thisis very very lightweightit's breathable especially within likethe summer and the humid heatmonths in the season that's coming uphere in tennesseethis one is a little bit more heavier sothat's why i wanted to get the shortsbecause i can still technically wearthis in the summertime i just will besweating a little bit morebut the shorts will kind of combat themso i got them in this gray color becausei don't have any gray workout clothesum so i just thought that this would bea nice little addition to my workoutwardrobeit's just really pretty it doesn't havelike the finger holes in this one it'salso a longer cropit has the gym shark logo on the bottomwhich i like the one on the bottom thatjust says gym sharkand then also on the back it's a littlescrunch so i thought that was a cutelittle addition to it just to play upyour backthen the shorts i got to match it theseare the black shorts black small so alsogetting outside of my comfort zone i'mgoing to be wearing like more like alittle bit of a cropand also biker shorts so that is like mymotivation and body confidence that i'mchannelingfor this summer in the spring so i'mgoing to be wearing a lot more shortsand we're going to work it and we'regoing to look cute we're going to havethat body yada yadasnatched well it's already snatchedbecause body confidenceeverybody is snatched but mentally we'regoing to be likebody is snatched and i can work it andi'm gonna wear a two-piece swimsuit andi'm gonnawear halter tops with my back out and mycleavage all the different stuff i'm notmaking any sensei got matching shorts and they look sotiny on camera buthopefully they're not like booty bootyshorts almost says something elseso i'm excited to see what this lookslike on my body type sobut i'm gonna stop rambling and we'regonna do a little bit of a try on hauland then do the workout for today i'mactually to log out of my computer sincei'm about to go on my lunch breakbefore my meeting at one o'clock andlet's do a littleof a trying haul so you guys don't mindthat over thereit's like my tripod and my suitcasebecause i'm decluttering this roombut this is the first set and i reallylike it a loti i feel like i would be confident to goout in public with like this little cropi feel like it like shows off the abs alittle bit and it'salso a nice length it's not superlike super crop cropped i wish thesewere a little bit more high-waistedi did get everything in a size small buti really do like the wayit fits it's very very very skin tightbut i think that's becauseit's supposed to secure yourself likewhile you're working out soum i didn't pull them up all the way buti think overall they look really reallycute i think they're very veryvery flattering and i feel like i wouldbe really really confident working outwith these so first set is good to go inmy booki almost might work out in this todaybut i want to show you guyswhat the other set looks like on but ijust have my black adidas socks on in myin my nike's but anywho let's tryon the second the second oneso this is the second set you guys andthese tops areso like they're really they're reallytight if i'm being honest i wish i wouldhavemaybe went to a medium but i thinkthey're supposed to fit this way so i'mjust going to keep this smallbecause everyone that i've like washedis like similar to my body shape theyalways get like smalls extra smallsbut i can imagine putting up an extrasmall because the small is likeit's comfy but i think it's supposed tobe like this but anywhothis is the yellow top it's very veryvery see-through so i'm glad that i havelike a blackbra underneath it but i feel like itjust snatchesthe waist really nicely and then also ifeel like this yellow color is just sopretty on black skin sowhen i saw it i had to get it i like howthis is a little bit longer because ican pull the crop down so you won't seetoo much of my belly and these leggingsare actuallyvery very long so i can do it like thisyou can't even seemuch of my belly but anywho these arethe leggingsi don't know if i said it but they areboth seamless so these are seamless sothey don't have the seam going down themiddlethen also the shorts are made the sameway but i lovehow high high-waisted these are i feellike they are very veryflattering they just look really goodwith my body shape tooi feel like they accentuate my legs aswell because i have very muscular legsfrom playing sports all my life but ithink that they lookreally really good on my body shape sothese are the leggings you guysi feel very supported and i don't feellike they're see-through or anythinglike thatbut they're really cute so i thinki might

hey everyone and welcome to my channelthis is the first video I've done inquite a long time but I wanted to reviewJim shark legging so if you follow someof the major fitness people on socialmedia you definitely know about Jimshark made pretty famous by Nikki blackinner and Christian guzmán and all thoseamazing people who I follow and watchtheir YouTube channels they're awesomechazzy Garcia and that's why I'mthinking peoples like Instagram handlesand like jazzy poo but anyway so Idecided to order a pair of theirleggings because I figured if theseamazing girls with big muscular buttsare doing its hardcore workouts in themthey would be awesome for me because I'mtraining to be such a thing so I firstmade the mistake of ordering thecompression leggings which look likethis and I was super excited because Ilove black my whole wardrobe was blackand I thought these would go perfectlyit was nice and high-waisted they'd beawesome for squats and deadlifts and allthose things they came the mellah Itried them on they felt amazing I bentover and it was a full moon party so Iwas super disappointed and I emailed Jimshark who were super fantastic in theresponse they explained to me that theyare for running and so they're notreally meant for compound movements andsquatshence the siege earnest although I stillthink you know when people are runningthey're going to bend over and tie theirshoes a little risque anyhow they weresuper nice and offered to send me a pairof their flex leggings which are madefor such a thing and they look laga thisI'll put in some photos in the commentsbut don't think you can see my butt whenI squatso I'm really happy the quality seemspretty good they're not crazy expensiveyou do have to pay a bit in shippingsocially if you're in Canada like myselfbut they cover the cost of these oneswhich is super cool of them and they dofeel like buttah so that is my review Ijust thought people should know ifyou're wanting to order these and Ithink they'll work the price if you'rewilling to pay shipping but also becareful which ones you order becausecompression pants not in the weight roomand let's see what looks for the wrongreason anyways I'm going to be doing alot more fitness and nutrition videos Ihope they'll follow along I've actuallydecided to do a fitness competition soI'll be competing in bikini I'm stillscared in August so I will be talkingmore about that and updating you on myprogress seeing some cool things so hopeyou follow,22,UC7-DCy9WiWtG0WPw-QcAggw,Dan Camacho,3,2,0,8,"['Gymshark', 'snapback', 'hat', 'unboxing']",Gymshark Snapback unboxing,JERLfVJBUyo,1461

hey guys so I recently did some shoppingfor some gym fitness apparel because youknow I'm in the gym a lot and I want tolook cute and feel comfortable mostlyand just feel kind of motivated toworkout I find sometimes when I have anew outfit or I have some sportswearthat I really feel comfortable in I'mjust like more motivated to work outwhich it's weird but it works for me soanyways I went to gym shark and I didsome shopping I spent about $500 thereand this video is not sponsored so thisis my honest opinion I actually haven'teven tried on anything yet so that's whyyou're gonna see all the tags on becausethey don't even know if these are gonnafit me but the reason I'm sharing thiswith you is because when I do shoppingfor clothes online often I want to lookat YouTube for reviews to see how theclothes look on normal people and Ididn't really find that much for thelatest collection which is what I boughtnow in the beginning of 2019 so I'mgonna share with you what I think I'mgonna share with you that all of thepants that I bought are size small allof the tops that I bought our sizemedium so hopefully that reference willhelp you making your decision let's getstarted so first of all this is not likea workout thing I think this is more oflike loungewear so just lounging aroundthe house I actually think it's supercomfortable I've been wearing it formaybe like 30 minutes now I like that ithas these like straps that you wraparound and I do like the back like thebra area I think it's really cool youcan see the back it's kind of likeballerina it is high waisted which ithink is flattering because itaccentuates the smallest part of yourwaist I'm going to walk back a bit so ifyou can see here that's the pants at thebottom they have like a little bit ofdetails it kind of feels like long johnsthis is how it looks here and this iscalled the slouch bralette steel-bluemare morrow and i guess this is theslouch bottoms so yeah I really likethis the only thing I don't really likeis this crotch area I feel like it's alittle bit like I guess I could pull itup higher which is fine but I do kind offeel like this could be a little bitshorter but it's not bad I do like thatit hugsmy waist because oftentimes the pantsthey don't fit my waist so I like thatthis is really a good size for me and Ido like the way it accentuates my curvesthis is how the top looks has like thegym shark logo there in the back okay sothis next one is called the flawlessknit sports bra and I guess the flawlessknit bottoms as well again at JimSharkey you don't have to buy the piecestogether you can buy them individuallybut I do like to have matching sets sothese are the bottoms and they seem likethe materials like super stretchybecause when you look it doesn't looklike it's gonna fit me but what I put iton it'll stretch and the sports bra ismore high coverage which I like if I'mworking out at the gym because quitefrankly when I work out at the gym Idon't like to be covered in long sleevesor sweat shirts I like to have my skinbare because I get overheated veryeasily I've been like this since a kid Icould never wear long sleeves in wintertime it was so weird my mom's like put ajacket on so I prefer to have my skinexposed but I also don't want to showtoo much and like distract people so Ithink this will be a great option soI've got it on at first I'm really notsure about this color on me I feel likeit's a little bit too pastel and I feellike it just almost makes me look likeI'm naked I don't know if that's true ornot but I don't know I don't I think itmight be something I have to get used toor I just don't like it I feel like itjust shows too much I don't know I'm notsure so this is how it looks this pantsare really tight um I was a bit of astruggle to get on they are a size smalland I do have like I'm not really thinso I do have more meat on my legs and mybutt but the reason I don't like to getmedium is because oftentimes thewaistband doesn't fit me and I love itwhen the waistband is tight so in thiscase I probably would have gone themedium because I think it would have fitbetter and then this one and then thesports bra it's cool I like the back Ithink it looks really good the pantsI don't know it also has a little bit ofthis like crotch thing which kind oflike is a little bit funny but it's goodfor working out because that lets yourcrotch breathe which is nice but it doeslook a little bit funny I'm gonna backup for you the top in terms of fit Ithink it's a pretty good fit I mean I amhaving a bit of side boob here but Ithink the sports bra is actuallyintended to have some of that just bythe shape of itmy breasts are a Triple D just for yourreference from the side I think it's apretty good fit you know I probablywouldn't do cardio with the sports brabut it's not bad it's pretty goodcoverage I do like that it's not showinga ton of cleavage from the front whichis nice let's just see if this is squatproof it's hard to tell I'm also wearingmy high waisted underwear the lux curbsunderwear you might want to get somehigh-waisted I've to wear for this typeof outfit otherwise you're probablygonna see the lines here yeah I thinkthis is cute I just don't know about thecolor but overall the material feelsreally nice it feels like I could reallyrun and I could do anything I could doyoga and this I could stretch I could dogymnastics it's like super movable itfeels good so the next one I'm gonna tryon is this sports bra which doesn't havebottoms but I got it individuallybecause I thought it looked cute so thisis how it is from the front in the backbut I am gonna try it on with thesebottoms which I also bought individuallybecause the top was sold out looking atthese now I also don't know if this ismy colorin general I don't think I should havepicked pink I don't know if I like pinkbut we're gonna try them on anyways soagain this feels like super stretchy andcomfortable so I think it'll be reallynice so this sports bra is definitelymore sexy as it reveals a lot morecleavage this probably would be reallygreat for someone who has a little bitless cleavage than me again this is asize medium this called the e Litesports bra and black I do like it thoughI think it is nice I probably wouldn'twear it to the gym I might just wear itlike with different outfits and stuffjust because who knows you know you'reworking out having a really hardcoreworkout in the newflings out but I have seen girls wearthe sports bra at the gym that I go toand looks really good on them but Idon't know if I personally would nowthese pants these are called the vitalseamless leggings dusty pink marl mediumoh I bought a medium that's why theydon't fit me okay so I should havebought a small or maybe they made amistake I'm thinking out loud so you cansee this is why I usually don't buymediums the medium fits me here this isgood but then look at the waist I don'tlike this I work hard for my waist and Iwant to accentuate it I don't want tomake it like looks bigger than it is soI might have to return these but havingsaid that these leggings feel amazinglike I definitely prefer them over theprevious ones I feel like they are justreally really easy to move inyou know same as the other ones but forsome reason they just feel nicer andthis big thick waistband feels comfortand it feels like it is pulling in mystomach which is nice show you back hereso this is how the pants look the famousInstagram pose I think the color isbetter than the other one it doesn'treally feel like skin showing it feelslike it's pink pants the other one Ifelt like it was a little bit tooblended with my skin it depends on yourskin tone I do like the pants becauseyou can definitely like accentuate yourmuscles on your legs and you see all ofyour muscles which is nice because it'sreally skin tight like you can seeeverything but I do think that it wouldprobably give a bit of a camel toe to behonest yeah it's too bad I actuallyreally like these but I think I'm gonnahave to return them for a smaller sizethis really bothers me having this gaphere so the next one I'm gonna try onand this is the last one this is thelatest collection the kamla camosseamless leggings and laberd lavendergray and the top so I'm gonna pop thison and we'll see okay so I've got thelast one on and this is exactly why it'sgood to see the outfits on differentbodies before you buy them because againthe sports bra looks just so cute on somany people but I didn't see anyone withmy sights chest wearing it like I thinkit is cute and comfortable and sexy butprobably not something we're actuallywe're to the gym and the whole point wasbecause I wanted to get a matching setto wear to the gym so now if I don'twear the top I'm gonna feel like oh wellthe bottoms they don't have a matchingtopso anyways very boobie so this isprobably I mean if you like to look fineif you don't then maybe this is betterfor someone who has a smaller chestdefinitely gonna wear it around thehouse I love this outfit though like thebottoms I think are my favorite I don'tknow I said that about all three didn'tI well I feel like they are a little bitmore modest but they do have a bit of ascrunch butt so it does kind of cinch inthere in terms of the color I wasn'tsure if I would like this camo but Iactually really do it's like dark enoughand it looks like gym clothes it doesn'tlook like it's skin the material is kindof the same thing so it's verycomfortable and this is the sports brafrom the back I do like the sports bar Ithink it's pretty cool actually and thewaist fits me good so again this one's asize small and it is a thicker waistwhich I do like I really do like thisoutfit I just wish that it was a littlebit like here maybe and this it reallyjust pushing your boobs there are pads Ifeel like they are supportive eventhough I wouldn't do cardio with thisit's Jill feels like I have really goodsupport yeah thumbs up so I mean I likedall the stuff that I got I will bereturning those pants that didn't fit mywaist I'll probably try and find asports bra to match this that I can wearto the gym or maybe I just need to learnto be comfortable and be confident andcomfortable we'll see so not trying topromote gym sharp but just trying toshare with you the outfits that I boughtand hopefully it helps you I know thatsome people are gonna ask me about whenI'm gonna do another workout videobecause I always get asked this wheneverI do kind of like a clothing haul I workout every single day and I have theopportunities to film every single daybut when I travel sometimes the gymsdon't allow you to film right now I'mnot working out at Gold's Gym and Denniswhere there's all these influencers andeveryone's always filming but I needsomeone to film for me I don't havesomeone who can film me I would like tomaybe eventually have a workout buddywhere we can film each other and thenthat way I can create some cool videosfor you guys and then also some gymsdon't allow you to film so some gyms arelike super strict about it just for likeprivacyand then sometimes I personally don'tfeel comfortable whipping up my cameraand filming but definitely you know myworkouts have evolved quite a bit I usedto just like train my legs a lot and nowI really do train my whole body andagain if you want to have that hourglassillusion waist training is great I usemy waist trainer comment below andthumbs up if you do you want me tocreate a new workout video and that'llmotivate me to get it done alright guysbye hey guys if you liked
