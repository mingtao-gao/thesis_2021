phantom venom bootsin the year since he has worn blackoutboots orange nike bootsblackout mizuno boots as well as adidaspredators and adidas coppersbut what's the significance[Music]well thiago is one of a number ofplayers who over the past yearhave ended their relationship with nikeand industry insiders suspectthis will mark the beginning of majorrealignmentin a market that has for a long timebeen taken for granted as a source ofconsiderableextra income for footballers in manycases nike themselves have taken thedecisionnot to offer renewal deals to players atthe end of their existing contractsprivately there is claim and counterclaim over whether a player has decidedto leave a brandor the brand itself has chosen to stepaway but it is absolutely clearthat there has been an exodusothers to depart include neymar rafaelvaransergio ramos and marco asensio as wellas raheemsterling bakayosaka and bayern munichpair leroy sana and robert lewandowskiand there are different explanations forthis in september 2020neymar left for puma in a deal that thebrand sawas a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity tosign an elite superstarfrom the player's perspective inaddition to a contract worth around 30million dollars a yearneymar may have been attracted by thechance to beat the standout starat puma following the rise of his psgteammate and bappeat nike in a familiar theme sourcesclose to leading players have suggestedthat elite stars requiremore attention and promotion than theyhave sometimes receivedfrom the largest brands and internalcompetition is commonfor example the athletic is aware of oneleading brazilian playerwho was unhappy to play second fiddlewhile neymarremained at nike as one agent explainsyou can sign my player but what will youdo for him will he be in the adverts orwill he stand at the back behind theother star playersbudgetary issues provoked by thepandemic have compelled nike to reducerisk by limiting their endorsement dealsthe company's co-founder phil knight hassaid that kovid19hammered us in the financial quarter tomay 31 2020and warned that it will change the wholeface of the businessadidas also saw sales fall by 90 in thefirst three months of 2020before rebounding well later in the yearand yet one well-placed industry sourcefrom a rival brand insisted that theapproach at nikeis not related to the pandemic insteadit's believed to be an internal policychange several years in the makingwith a new focus on a smaller number ofdiverse elite athletesand with themes of social justiceincorporated into campaignskillian and bappe jaden sancho andmarcus rashford are examples of clientsthat nike hopes will be at the heartof their promotions and across the restof the industrymore generally several agents andcommercial advisors to playerssay that the appetite for six figureretainers for premier league defendersor defensive midfieldersis hugely on the wane and that brandsare focusing more than everon creative talent there are stillretainers offered to elite young talentbut one agent describes the changesthese brands want to return on theirinvestment which they know they can getfrom elite senior talentbut is a teenager driving that in thesame way are you recouping six figuresbecause an arsenal defender is wearingyour boots the market has beenunrealisticand as that market adjusts aninteresting symptom of that flux isappearingthe departures from nike in particularhave shown the growing trend of playersacross europe wearing blackout bootsvarane ramos ascencio and lewandowskihave all been pictured wearing themwhile deliberating their next moveand one agent explains why when a playeris out of contract with a brand he saysthey often wear blackout boots becausethe brand will not give them moneyanymoresome will go to the extent of going tothe shop buying the boots of a brandand then spraying all over them to avoidgiving the brand marketing valuenow sometimes the plan doesn't workseveral years ago adnan yanazi wasbetween contracts at nike and newbalanceand needed to spray over his nike bootsso as not to promote the brand he hadleftyet the match played out amid heavyrainfall and over the course of the gamenike's distinctive tick became visibleraheem sterling had more success he leftnike last year and wore blackout bootsin a match against southamptonhe also wore whiteout boots in thisseason's champions leagueand he's expected to join new balance sotoo is arsenal sackerwhile elsewhere adidas have securedagreements for thiagoramos and asensio and varan is likely tojoin neymarat puma the scene is changing one sourcesees it as cyclical though pointing outthat while the breadth of portfolios islikely to shrinkthe rewards for the greatest talents canriseso as europe's elite

[Music]hello my name is stefan munsinger i'mthe manager for ford performance ineuropeand today i want to introduce theall-new puma sti'll give you some technical insight ofwhat this car is all about[Music]now what's special about it it's thefirst suv in the european fordperformance lineup and we target itto create a car that combines the urbanutility the day-to-daypracticality of an suv with the astinasand the fun to drivefun to drive being the overarchingpremise of any ford performance productso on the exterior the first thing thatreally stands out is the colorit's a mean green it's a color which isuh unique to puma sdand pumast also features a high glossblack exterior theme so certain partsare always in hydros blackstarting with the roof this particularcar has a panel roof but non-paneralvehicles havepainted black roof as standard and thetheme continuesinto the rear wing side spearsand mirror caps so the black themecontinues to the frontwe have the st logo embedded in thefront grilleand then there is a part i want to pointout to you which is thefront splitter here it's an additionalpart that's mounted to the bottom of theof the bumper it's unique for stso it's an aerodynamic part it improvesdrag reduces the drag at the same timeincreases downforceso from an aerodynamic perspective it'sreally a bit of a win-winand besides that attribute effect thevisual appearanceis pretty cool differentiates the car ireally like this part in particularthe ford performance letters on top ofittwo things i want to point out at therear of the car we have a uniquedefuser for st and the exhaustpretty clean honest design your dualpipe stainless steel slash cutno fake features like some of thecompetitors haveand the exhaust features a valve so thevalve depending on drive mode and drivecondition opens up and itamplifies the raspy i3 sound and whenyou start revving this thing it actuallysounds pretty cool okay so let's talkaboutthe wheels the vehicle comes standardwith 19-inch alloyson two 25-40 tires the rim design thetwo different ring designs there is amagnetite matte painted rim and thenthere is a machinedversion of this rim and this particularcar has the machined rimon the tire it's a michelin pilot 4stirepart of the michelin high performancetire lineup and we developed this tiretogether with michelin specifically forpuma stand there's actually a ford performanceimprinton the tire on the sidewall fp whichindicates that this specification isparticular for puma st and that's a tirethat you can also getvia the michelin aftermarket channelsso let's talk about some of theessential ingredients that actuallymake it an stthe engine it's a 1.5 liter ecoboostwith a manual transmissionit's based on a fiesta sd so it's an i3engine boostedwhich provides a pretty good balancebetweenperformance and efficiencywe upped the torque from 290 newtonmeter in fiesta stto 320 newton meter in puma stand we also shortened the final driveratio slightly to compensate for thelargerwheels so as a result we're gettingpretty good acceleration performancezero to 100 is at 6.7 seconds and vmaxis at 220 kphwe also offer an optional quive limitedslip differentialfor improved front end tractionthe quive in combination with torquevectoring also depending on the drivemodesactually provides really good roadholding and avoids understeer behaviorthere's another key ingredient i need tomention to you which is the brake systemwe actually upsized the brake systemsignificantly versus base pumait has a 325 millimeter disc in thefrontso these brakes really provide sustainedbraking performance also when you'retaking it on the trackwe did take this car to the nurburgringquite a bit during its developmentand the brake system actually behavedquite well out therenow on driving dynamics so obviouslythis car is an suv with a higher centerof gravityso we had to be innovative and clever todeliver thest type driving dynamics so startingwithanti-roll bar in the front a twist beamin the rear which is about 50stiffer versus base pumaand we achieve this by a thickeru-profile and also an addedtorsion bar into the new profile of thetwist beamthen we have unique stiffer bushes allaround on the suspensionwe have a unique knuckleon the car to get us to the road centerwhere we want it to beand also improves the steering ratio andwe haveunique springs and shocks shocks arefrom itachi twin tube in the frontmonotube in the rearthe shocks feature an frd systemfrequency responsive dampeningwhich helps to improve rolling plushnesswhen you're going over smallinputs or rough road surfaces but at thesame timethe shocks have the control that withthe dampening and the control that wewant for an st when you go over biggereventsand then steering steering key for anysti mentioned the knuckle unique geometrybut we also have a uniquesteering rack with a quicker ratio soknuckle in combination with the uniquerack overall delivers a 25 percentquicker steering ratio so the steeringresponseturn in response is actually exceptionalof this carit's key for any st and this carprovides great connected feel so estinasis one thingbut this car remains to offer the suvpracticalityflexible load department withbest-in-class trunk spaceand of course the innovative megaboxwhich features another 80 liters ofadditional storage volumewhich easily fits your most importantgearlet's take a look at the interiorfirst thing that greets you are the fordperformance cuff bladesinside the car the recaro seats areanother key ingredient for stnice side bolstering to provide optimumsight support and also the micro dynamicfabric provides good grip and actuallyalso feelsquite nice and we have metal graystitchingall around a unique gear shift knob ondstwith a red lettering and then thesteering wheel flat button steeringwheel with the sd logo on the bottomand drive mode switches directly on thesteering wheelwe have four drive modes in st echonormal sport and crack now they can beselected by amode button on the steering wheel whereyou basically togglethrough the drive modes and then selectthe oneyou want or there is also an sbutton on the steering wheel it's adirect sport select button so wheneveryou press that buttonyou directly and instantly go into sporti like to call it the fun buttonand typically where you would use thisis when you drive on the road and yousee some somecorners coming and you say okay i wantto do these corners in sport mode maybeand you just simply push it and theninstantly you're in that modeso quite a lot of stuff comes standardon sd it's things like heated seatssteering wheel heated front windshieldparking sensors front and rear 19-inchalloysand then on the interior we have recaroseats standardthere are three optional packs on pumast there's a performance pack whichcontains the quivelsd and launch control and then there isa driver assistancepack and then last but not least thereis a special x packagewhich contains the machined rims and ledheadlampsso this concludes my walk around ofpumasd first europeanford performance suv i hope you enjoyedand learned a bit more about the carwe think it nicely combines the utilityand style of an suv with a stinus andfun to driveorders can be placed from septemberonwards and deliveries will actuallystart right

yeah myname's jayum i've got a full puma um andthis is a little bit about me and thetrack or i guess really[Music]so jake tell me about your car what whatis it you're drivinguh what is it it's a 2000 uhford puma little 1.7 umstarted out as a uh it was a relativelynice car to be fair i still remember theday i bought it i bought it off somelady in chelmsfordand um i could probably take youstraight back to my house actuallybecause i rememberagreed the price and bought it and thenshe wept like a schoolgirlas i was driving off her drivewaybecause i don't think she expected me totake it there and thenshe just bawled her eyes out but i'dlove to take it back to her and gotada look what i've done to this i'veruined itbasically what makes a puma a good trackcarbecause it maybe isn't the obviouschoice it's not and if you were going tobuya ford hatch of that era you would buyan st150 fiestai mean why wouldn't you you get atwo-liter engine you getbetter dynamic chassis dynamics butwhy buy a hatchback when i can buy asporty little coupe i didn't realize atthe time i was buying a hairdresser'scar and probably the mostgirly car my first people was dog meantto be fair and i did uhi did stand out like a sore thumb in iti remember turning up trying to make soi know what i've bought they're likequick back short back and sides perm orsomething like that anduh i don't know they get under your skinwhy makes it a good cartop gear 97 car of the year goodreference i like thatso this is jay's hairdresser's i mean uhtrack car so jay talk us through some ofthe stuff on here like the ironing boardon the back for examplestart with the wig yeah and the arrow soi wanted a big wing kind of don't we alli like i like the look of it but i don'twant something that i could just buy onebay so i wanted something functionalso this was designed bybyc designs uh mark up inup in preston up north proper god'scountry proper god's countryyork shitty and everything so he did thewing and the skirtsoriginally we're going to do the wing ifyou're not with some skirts as well andit's notjust fit and forget you know knocksomething up and build it this is allum cfd testedokay modeled the car cfd i did thesplitter canardsi saw these on a ferrari gt3 car so ithought if it's good enough for themit's good enough for meand i think i think the idea behindthese is it stops air going in the wheelarch and uses the wheel as kind of likean extractorto remove the air the next mod is i seei see the obligatory use of uh cableties yeahmark gave me some of them little nicethings soum yeah the next mod for the aero iswe're gonna vent the wingto release the pressure out the archesyep and i've also gotsome wide arches coming for it butthey're not your standardbolt on round here they're a bit arethey like the racing puma ones orno they're actually so the rears are offa mark v golf british touring carwow okay and the fronts we haven't quiteworked that out yetcarbon fiber bonnet as well yeah

performance on thecar yesterday at kabul park[Music][Music][Music]in terms of the best track day i've everdone umexperience-wise two years ago whenrockingham closed 2018i think it was which we track addictshosted what was the last ever trap thereat rockyin november in the november of 2018. umwe've done a fewi pestered the guys at rockingham to letme have the last day they gave it usand it sold out to just a bunch offriendsso everybody on that pit lane knew eachother 60 cars and everybody on that pitlane was friendsit was brilliant that was the best itwas kind of like a great sender forrockinghamuh and it was just yeah it was just agood laugh all around you know nobodywas chasing times nobody was being anidiot everybody knew each other so itwas really friendly and really openthere was no egos or anything like thatand it was just one of them days wherelike a really crispwinter's day when the sun's out it's notparticularly warm but everything's dryand it's just nice it's brilliant yeahgreat great great place rockinghamreally miss ittalking about the mods on the car whatdo you think is your favorite mod youdid to the puma what was thewhat was the thing that made the mostdifference let's say uhwell with the puma you you've got toplay to its strengths it's never goingto be a rocket ship down straight it's130 horsepowerso you do what it does you you you knowyou improve the bits it's already goodat so handlingit wasn't very good at braking so we diduh yeah the brakes were woeful so as isay we had a bit of ahybrid of ford parts from a mondeo orif you want to be really posh jaguar xtype calipers and it uses an st-170 discuh makes it bigger and that was great wehad it on standardi think we just had some ebay discs andpads on it and it worked really well butthe best partwe did was it went uh we worked reallyclosely with tarox brakesand they fired us outside of their raceback you know for sort of fast roadtrackum pads and discs and that justtransformed it it really showed whatsort of difference proper materials canmake on a car umand since then um we've always usedtarox brakes on that car and anythingelse that we kind of classed as a trackaddict fleet so we uhyeah it was that was probably one of thebest things we did on the car just beingable toyou know you can't get down the streetsparticularly quickly so you arrive at aslightly slower speed but being able tocarry that speeddeeper into a braking zone than justreally get on the brakesyeah it really helped yeah then justtaking the weight out of it just to makeityou know brought it along it's um thelotus principlesimplify and add lightness no theforward principle let it rotyeah we'll talk about the track addictfleet so it's obviously not just youbehind the track addict name so who

hi everyone Kevin here from golf guyreviews and in this video today I wantedto do a first impressions of the brandnew Puma RSG golf shoes now these arelimited edition spikeless pair of golfshoes from Puma and they are doing a lotof things quite differently compared toyou know a lot of the golf shoes outthere now I wanted to do this firstimpressions video not only to giveeveryone a closer look in regards tosome of the style and design elements ofthis limited edition show but alsoactually so that you know importantlyhow they fit on feet in case you'rethinking about buying them now clearlythis is not my fall of you I've notactually worn these out on the golfcourse yet so I can't tell you howthey're going to perform but what I cantell you is how they fit and fill andbefore we go through any of the detailson the show the first thing I would justwanted to kind of highlight is thatthese shows do seem to come up a bitsmall so I ordered these in a UK 9 whichis my regular size and in a lot of Pumashows they actually seem to come up alittle bit biggertraditionally certainly the NX e Igniterange which is a shoe I wear a lot doeshave quite a bit of room and that seemsto be a little bit longer than normalthese do seem to come up a little bitsmall so if you are considering buyingthe new RSG range I personally wouldrecommend maybe trying them half a sizebigger but definitely see if you can trythem or at least order a couple of pairsto make sure you get a pair that fitsyour feet properly these are still theUK 9 version and I've had to order a 9and a half just and I can get out on thecourse and let you know what theyactually are like to use out on the golfcourse now I definitely want to getthese out in the golf course becausethey've got such a chunky midsole thatI'm just interested to see how theyactually perform and how stable they areout in the course so once I've got apair that fits me right and I've put afew rounds under my belt look out for myfull review video I'll post a link to itabove that's the wrong side I'll post alink to it above and so you know keep alookout for that and I will let you knowwhat they think of these once I've giventhem a four of you but for now this isjust a first look and let's take a lookat some of the design elements of theshow so the Puma RS sneakers have becomea real hit lately because of their boldchunky design and this bold kind ofcolor-block design that they've gotgoing on and the fact that actuallythey're quite affordable so Germanyin the UK for well under a hundredpounds now these golf shoes at themoment retail in the UK for ninetypounds which again is pretty decentprice point when you think of some ofthe night spikeless shows like the MX 1GS they retail at a hundred or even theair jordan spike shoes they retail forwell over 150 pounds so coming in atninety pounds for a limited-edition shoethat's a real good price point sohopefully you'll be able to pick up thepair of these now I also picked up thewhite and grey versions that I've gothere because I thought I'd see whichones I prefer but once they arrived andI put both of them on I definitelypreferred the green and orange versionsI kind of figured that if you're gonnaget a pair of golf shoes that reallystand out and look this different inregards to their chunky design you mightas well make sure that they really lookdifferent nowI've got enough pairs all kind of whitegolf shoes out there and although theselook cool and lows and those are peoplewere going to like these for mepersonally I just fell in love with thegreen and orange the moment I saw himand just decided yet definitely B's andthe ones that I'm going to keepinterestingly with the white and grey Idid run a poll on my social media andthese were the ones which did prove morepopular and don't forget there is ablack version as well and theninterestingly the hill part here is thissilver material actually so there's alittle bit reflection to it I'm not sureif the camera is going to quite pickthat up there but yeah that's definitelysilver rather than gray and there's abit of a metallic look to it and yetthey do look really really cool andreally really clean and fresh butpersonally I just decided that thesewere the ones for me I really hope youenjoyed this video today and you'refinding it helpful so hit that likebutton if you are and if you haven'tdone so already please make sure yousubscribe to my channel so you can keepup to date on all my latest reviews I'vegot shoes clothing and tech right hereand golf guy reviews now the originalversion of the RS running shoes wasactually released back in the 80s and infact RS spends for running system sothere was a version of these shows onmuch move you've seen them before thatactually had a little computer on theback of them way before you had GPSwatches or any technology in the showthat's kind of where the RS system therunning system originated from so theseare based on running trainers and morerecently you know they've been kind ofreworked and redesigned so thisparticular version is based on thex3 or RS x-cube doesnot which way to sayit we've this whole kind of chunkymidsole design and the bold colors so interms of the midsole there you've gotthis very chunky thick midsole there andyou've just got a whole lot of layeredmaterials there in regards to the upperthen this is using a microfiber leatherupper and what Puma have said is thatthey've actually got a thin TPU filmlayer over the topnow I haven't established whether that'sonly over the upper or whether it's overthe midsole doesn't feel like it's overthe midsole so I think maybe it's overthe upper only and let's the help itkeep it clean so again when I get theseout on the course I'll be interested tosee how clean I can keep theseinterestingly as well what Puma havesaid is that this is a seam sealed upperso you can kind of see here on all thekind of areas where you would find theseam you can see that they've over letthe material so you don't have anyexposed seems you've got that on theinside as well there although actuallyI've just spotted there's a seam therealong the outside I'm the biggest kindof part of the rear medial side of theshoe but you know I think that's gonnabe absolutely fine I'm Agustinwaterproofing but people have done thatto make sure these stay as waterproof asthey can be and they are given these aone-year waterproof warranty so it'll beinteresting to see how these actuallyhold up another thing to note on thedesign of the show is that you can seehere that you've got these differentsections of the foam here on the showyou've got both the same on the outsideand on the inside of the show and thepart on the front here you've got tosort a bit of texture to it as well soyou can see these kind of square patternon this part of the foam here and therest is then just kind of smooth thereon the show so just interesting kind ofdifferent design feature as well on theshow a few other designer that's tohighlight and you can see first of allhere that you've got the RSG logo thereon the tongue with a lightweight kind ofthin tongue pull tab on the front thereI'm not sure I'd want to put on that toomuch because that does seem quite thinand you can see here that you've reallygot these chunky laces on the shoe aswell which kind of match the whole kindof chunky vibe that the shoes got goingon now what is really really interestingfor me is actually when you put theseshoes on although they have got thisseriously kind of chunky look initiallyI thought that they're going to haveloadsrooming them but actually they'rethey're quite tight-fitting I mentionedat the very beginning there that thesedo come up small so that's all we're abigger size but in regards to justgenerally the fit and fill on feet theydo feel that they're looking down myfeet quite well my Hill definitely feelsnice and kind of tucked in there on theshow and there's quite a fair amount ofpadding on the ankle area there andespecially on the hill too which reallykind of helps keep it filled like it'slocked in it will be really reallyinteresting to see how these actuallyperformed given that it looks like theykind of sit up extremely high I justwonder where we're gonna be toppingevery shot that I hitbut I'm not entirely sure but we'll seewhen we get these out on the course nowpersonally what I think Puma are reallygoing for with these shows is actuallygoing for a trainer first approach andthen go through second so the idea Ireally think behind this training isthat you can easily wear this off thecourse but if you want to go througharound the Gulf then definitely you canplay some golf in it as well will it bea high-end performance shoe no not atallbut I don't think that's the marketthey're going for I think this is a realgood idea in regards to just kind ofcasual up the world of golf certainlygonna appeal to a younger audience I'mgetting older now and to be honest thisappeals to me I really like it I thinkhe looks a bit more like a dead shoe tobe honest in regards to the chunkinessof it and that's definitely a specificstyle that I know a lot of peoplewatching this video just won't reallylike they'll look at this shoe and gothat's hideous whereas a lot of otherpeople will look at this video and goissues absolutely gorgeous so it'sreally gonna be divisive so let me knowdown in the comments which category doyou fall into do you love it or do youhate it taking a closer look in the shoeand you have got a fusion foam innersole there and you can kind of see hereactually if I highlight it you've gotquite a thick area on the hill therewhich is just adding a little bit ofextra padding and also you can see onthe inside of the shoe there and thekind of instep of the foot you've gotquite a higher raised section as welladding some additional padding andsupport on the inside of the shoe nowthat's really interesting because a lotof golf shoes you get don't necessarilyprovide much support certainly in theirarch area of the shoe there now for mepersonally I don't particularly needthat and I do find that shoes that havegot aggressive kind of real higher archsupport actually end up hurting myyou find up wearing them for quite along time so it will be interesting tosee how I get on with these while we'retalking about the feeling underfootwe'll also take a look at this chunkymidsole foam that you've got here sothis is what Puma are calling theirfusion foam and the whole point of thatis to give you a higher energy returnnow I've not had too much experience tobe honest with the fusion foam with PumaI know they've got the very popularignite foam which I'm a big fan of andwhich is very very soft and gives adecent amount of energy return I've notgot much experience with a fusion foamso you have to wait to my full reviewand I'm letting you know how it feelsout on Kooks in regards to how I feltjust kind of wearing it about the housethen I would say that it's notnecessarily the softest feeling foam outthere at the moment maybe it feels a bitmore like a running shoe rather thanspecifically a very soft squishy foamfor a golf shoe but as I say we'll seehow it performs over 18-hole soon solastly let's take a look on the bottomof the shoe here and you've got thisreckless outsole now this is a carbonrubber combination outsole and you cansee here that you've got a variation ofdifferent kind of lugs so at the fronthere you've got these kind of I supposeslightly conical lug shapes towards thefront and then on the in this sectionhere on the medial side at the front andthe forefootyou've got more square lugs then on thissection here you've got these kind of Isuppose like bracket shapes lugs andthen swords the rear of the shoe you'vegot these circular kind of spikes at theback and then we go back to the samespikes that you've got the front at therear of the shoe here that's a reallyinteresting combination I don't know howmuch specific kind of design has goneinto that or whether it's just in therebecause it looks cool and I've got to behonest that they're not the mostaggressively styled spikeless shows outon the market so again this is whatleads me to believe this is more of acasual leisure kind of golf shoe ratherthan a high-performance golf showthere's not a problem you just need toknow what you're getting when you go inso I don't think I'm gonna have anyproblems with these wearing these out onthe course in regards to the summer andthe spring months and even moving intothe autumn but these are definitely notgonna be a pair of golf shoes that aregoing to provide me maximum tractionwhen the kind of course is starting toget wet out there and definitely I'd begoing for a spike shoe instead sothere's something interestand again I'll let you know how thesegrip out on the course once I do my forreviewinteresting even despite this bottom aswell what I would say about this is thatit does feel very grippy and rubberizedso we've some spikeless golf shoes youknow if you step on a slippery surfaceso they know if you've ever like gotinto a supermarket in a spikeless golfshoe sometimes just slipping all overthe place you've got no tractionwhatsoever these feel that these canactually be used like an everydaytrainer and I'd have no problems wearingthese are most kind of surfaces to behonest and then wearing them out on thegolf course so so they are very veryversatile indeed so there you go that'smy first look and first impressions ofthe brand-new Puma RSG golf shoes I'mreally really looking forward to gettingthese out in the course once I get themin a half a size bigger because you knowthere's no point cramming your foot intoa pair of golf shoes and then findingthem uncomfortable you've got to makesure that you're comfortable firstbefore you go out on the course but onceI've got them shoes I will definitely behitting the golf course and then you cancheck out my

thewhite and grey versions that I've gothere because I thought I'd see whichones I prefer but once they arrived andI put both of them on I definitelypreferred the green and orange versionsI kind of figured that if you're gonnaget a pair of golf shoes that reallystand out and look this different inregards to their chunky design you mightas well make sure that they really lookdifferent nowI've got enough pairs all kind of whitegolf shoes out there and although theselook cool and lows and those are peoplewere going to like these for mepersonally I just fell in love with thegreen and orange the moment I saw himand just decided yet definitely B's andthe ones that I'm going to keepinterestingly with the white and grey Idid run a poll on my social media andthese were the ones which did prove morepopular and don't forget there is ablack version as well and theninterestingly the hill part here is thissilver material actually so there's alittle bit reflection to it I'm not sureif the camera is going to quite pickthat up there but yeah that's definitelysilver rather than gray and there's abit of a metallic look to it and yetthey do look really really cool andreally really clean and fresh butpersonally I just decided that thesewere the ones for me I really hope youenjoyed this video today and you'refinding it helpful so hit that likebutton if you are and if you haven'tdone so already please make sure yousubscribe to my channel so you can keepup to date on all my latest reviews I'vegot shoes clothing and tech right hereand golf guy reviews now the originalversion of the RS running shoes wasactually released back in the 80s and infact RS spends for running system sothere was a version of these shows onmuch move you've seen them before thatactually had a little computer on theback of them way before you had GPSwatches or any technology in the showthat's kind of where the RS system therunning system originated from so theseare based on running trainers and morerecently you know they've been kind ofreworked and redesigned so thisparticular version is based on thex3 or RS x-cube doesnot which way to sayit we've this whole kind of chunkymidsole design and the bold colors so interms of the midsole there you've gotthis very chunky thick midsole there andyou've just got a whole lot of layeredmaterials there in regards to the upperthen this is using a microfiber leatherupper and what Puma have said is thatthey've actually got a thin TPU filmlayer over the topnow I haven't established whether that'sonly over the upper or whether it's overthe midsole doesn't feel like it's overthe midsole so I think maybe it's overthe upper only and let's the help itkeep it clean so again when I get theseout on the course I'll be interested tosee how clean I can keep theseinterestingly as well what Puma havesaid is that this is a seam sealed upperso you can kind of see here on all thekind of areas where you would find theseam you can see that they've over letthe material so you don't have anyexposed seems you've got that on theinside as well there although actuallyI've just spotted there's a seam therealong the outside I'm the biggest kindof part of the rear medial side of theshoe but you know I think that's gonnabe absolutely fine I'm Agustinwaterproofing but people have done thatto make sure these stay as waterproof asthey can be and they are given these aone-year waterproof warranty so it'll beinteresting to see how these actuallyhold up another thing to note on thedesign of the show is that you can seehere that you've got these differentsections of the foam here on the showyou've got both the same on the outsideand on the inside of the show and thepart on the front here you've got tosort a bit of texture to it as well soyou can see these kind of square patternon this part of the foam here and therest is then just kind of smooth thereon the show so just interesting kind ofdifferent design feature as well on theshow a few other designer that's tohighlight and you can see first of allhere that you've got the RSG logo thereon the tongue with a lightweight kind ofthin tongue pull tab on the front thereI'm not sure I'd want to put on that toomuch because that does seem quite thinand you can see here that you've reallygot these chunky laces on the shoe aswell which kind of match the whole kindof chunky vibe that the shoes got goingon now what is really really interestingfor me is actually when you put theseshoes on although they have got thisseriously kind of chunky look initiallyI thought that they're going to haveloadsrooming them but actually they'rethey're quite tight-fitting I mentionedat the very beginning there that thesedo come up small so that's all we're abigger size but in regards to justgenerally the fit and fill on feet theydo feel that they're looking down myfeet quite well my Hill definitely feelsnice and kind of tucked in there on theshow and there's quite a fair amount ofpadding on the ankle area there andespecially on the hill too which reallykind of helps keep it filled like it'slocked in it will be really reallyinteresting to see how these actuallyperformed given that it looks like theykind of sit up extremely high I justwonder where we're gonna be toppingevery shot that I hitbut I'm not entirely sure but we'll seewhen we get these out on the course nowpersonally what I think Puma are reallygoing for with these shows is actuallygoing for a trainer first approach andthen go through second so the idea Ireally think behind this training isthat you can easily wear this off thecourse but if you want to go througharound the Gulf then definitely you canplay some golf in it as well will it bea high-end performance shoe no not atallbut I don't think that's the marketthey're going for I think this is a realgood idea in regards to just kind ofcasual up the world of golf certainlygonna appeal to a younger audience I'mgetting older now and to be honest thisappeals to me I really like it I thinkhe looks a bit more like a dead shoe tobe honest in regards to the chunkinessof it and that's definitely a specificstyle that I know a lot of peoplewatching this video just won't reallylike they'll look at this shoe and gothat's hideous whereas a lot of otherpeople will look at this video and goissues absolutely gorgeous so it'sreally gonna be divisive so let me knowdown in the comments which category doyou fall into do you love it or do youhate it taking a closer look in the shoeand you have got a fusion foam innersole there and you can kind of see hereactually if I highlight it you've gotquite a thick area on the hill therewhich is just adding a little bit ofextra padding and also you can see onthe inside of the shoe there and thekind of instep of the foot you've gotquite a higher raised section as welladding some additional padding andsupport on the inside of the shoe nowthat's really interesting because a lotof golf shoes you get don't necessarilyprovide much support certainly in theirarch area of the shoe there now for mepersonally I don't particularly needthat and I do find that shoes that havegot aggressive kind of real higher archsupport actually end up hurting myyou find up wearing them for quite along time so it will be interesting tosee how I get on with these while we'retalking about the feeling underfootwe'll also take a look at this chunkymidsole foam that you've got here sothis is what Puma are calling theirfusion foam and the whole point of thatis to give you a higher energy returnnow I've not had too much experience tobe honest with the fusion foam with PumaI know they've got the very popularignite foam which I'm a big fan of andwhich is very very soft and gives adecent amount of energy return I've notgot much experience with a fusion foamso you have to wait to my full reviewand I'm letting you know how it feelsout on Kooks in regards to how I feltjust kind of wearing it about the housethen I would say that it's notnecessarily the softest feeling foam outthere at the moment maybe it feels a bitmore like a running shoe rather thanspecifically a very soft squishy foamfor a golf shoe but as I say we'll seehow it performs over 18-hole soon solastly let's take a look on the bottomof the shoe here and you've got thisreckless outsole now this is a carbonrubber combination outsole and you cansee here that you've got a variation ofdifferent kind of lugs so at the fronthere you've got these kind of I supposeslightly conical lug shapes towards thefront and then on the in this sectionhere on the medial side at the front andthe forefootyou've got more square lugs then on thissection here you've got these kind of Isuppose like bracket shapes lugs andthen swords the rear of the shoe you'vegot these circular kind of spikes at theback and then we go back to the samespikes that you've got the front at therear of the shoe here that's a reallyinteresting combination I don't know howmuch specific kind of design has goneinto that or whether it's just in therebecause it looks cool and I've got to behonest that they're not the mostaggressively styled spikeless shows outon the market so again this is whatleads me to believe this is more of acasual leisure kind of golf shoe ratherthan a high-performance golf showthere's not a problem you just need toknow what you're getting when you go inso I don't think I'm gonna have anyproblems with these wearing these out onthe course in regards to the summer andthe spring months and even moving intothe autumn but these are definitely notgonna be a pair of golf shoes that aregoing to provide me maximum tractionwhen the kind of course is starting toget wet out there and definitely I'd begoing for a spike shoe instead sothere's something interestand again I'll let you know how thesegrip out on the course once I do my forreviewinteresting even despite this bottom aswell what I would say about this is thatit does feel very grippy and rubberizedso we've some spikeless golf shoes youknow if you step on a slippery surfaceso they know if you've ever like gotinto a supermarket in a spikeless golfshoe sometimes just slipping all overthe place you've got no tractionwhatsoever these feel that these canactually be used like an everydaytrainer and I'd have no problems wearingthese are most kind of surfaces to behonest and then wearing them out on thegolf course so so they are very veryversatile indeed so there you go that'smy first look and first impressions ofthe brand-new Puma RSG golf shoes I'mreally really looking forward to gettingthese out in the course once I get themin a half a size bigger because you knowthere's no point cramming your foot intoa pair of golf shoes and then findingthem uncomfortable you've got to makesure that you're comfortable firstbefore you go out on the course but onceI've got them shoes I will definitely behitting the golf course and then you cancheck out my

hi guys ian from the football boots teamand today in another episode of thefootballshow i'm going to be talking about whyneymar has ended upat humor there are a lot of questions toanswer about this and in this video i'llbe getting into all of the detailsbut first off i want to take a littlestep back and discuss how we got to thispoint so back in 2013neymar was the face of the hypervenomwhen they came outa massively successful boot for nike andthat was when neymar really burst ontothe stages around the time of his moveto barcelona things are going reallywell for him that was kind of the peakperhaps of things with neymar so hestarts off and he's wearing thehypervenoms very successful with thelaunchthey move on he goes to the 2014 worldcup and he got his ownspecial edition golden dreams so thosewere thegold uh boot yellow sole and it was allbased on the inspiration of he used tospray his boots goldwhen he was a kid these are fantastic umreleases they were just a specialeditionand he didn't really get to wear them ithink he maybe got a half in them orsomething and obviously got his backinjury at the tournament so moving on hecarried on wearing the hypervenoms heloved the hypervenoms a lot of peoplekind of now think they're a boot thedecadethey um that kind of grippy upperneymar's a big fan of them now rememberthese are with the low collar that'llget more importantas we get on in this episode um so hemoved on from those he then went on towear the liquid dreamsnow the liquid dreams were a silverversion a signature editionfor uh neymar and they were silverversion pretty much of the golden dreamsbut they did have this pinkaccent to them and that's going to beimportant as well he went on and it gotto the point that that was kind of thelastish pair that he wore of the originalhypervenomsthen they changed into the hypervenomtwos and this is where things started toget a little bitdownhill for the relationship perhapsbetween nike andneymar now some of the things i say inthis video are going to be my opinionsthey're not necessarily factsjust what i think about it so i don'twant to get myself into trouble withnike or with neymarbut i'm going to tell you how i see itand how i interpret what happens soneymar is wearing the hypervenom twosthese are now the oneswith the collar on them he doesn't likethem as much as he likedthe original boots it doesn't really geton with them as muchover time nike then released a new upperas kind of upgrade to the upper to tryand solve some of the problems whichreally took us backto a more similar upper they also hadthe finish available which was the lowversion neymar would be seen wearingthose a little bitso those type of venom twos this is whenwe started to see the collabbetween jordan and neymar and these aresome of the bestkind of collab boots that we've seen theproblem is is neymarstill doesn't like the hypervenom atthis point and he doesn't really likewearing them somuch in fact that they bought out ablack pair and a white pair and ibelieve the black oneshe was just seen wearing the finishedversion he wasn't wearing the ones withthe collarbut the main problem wasn't just thecollar on there he didn't like that butalsothe upper it just didn't suit him so hewants to wear the vaporsand so he actually gets nike to make hima pair of vaporsthat are disguised to look like thehypervenoms that he's supposed to bemarketingso you might have heard about thisbefore but in essence the boots when yousee them close up you can tell thatthey're a pair of mercurial vaporsbut they've been painted up and designedto look like the hypervenoms that he'sactually marketingso there is a real big kind of issuenike tried to work it out by making themlook like what is marketing but it's abig problem when your player doesn'tlikethe boots that he's being paid to wearso eventually neymar manages to gethimself out of the hypervenomshypervenom moves on to the hypervenomthrees it's not an amal thingneymar is in the vapors and nike takethat on board and they decide to makehim kind of the big face of the vapoursbut this is where the problem is is thatthe vapor isn't really nike's high-endoffering in the mercurial linethey're all ways trying to put peopleinto the superflyso with this superfly you've got thelikes of ronaldo in themyou've got vape in them and you've nowgot sancho in them as wellthat is their elite offering and thevapor is underneath it so it's a bit ofa problemwhen you've got one of your headlineplayers wanting to wear that boot thatisunderneath but nike went with it andthey created the written in the starsvapers for himnow those ones were based on hisachievements with brazil they're kind ofa blueboot uh star details on them and they'reactually very nice kind of signatureedition for himmoving on when we got to the 2018 worldcup that was whenneymar got his mo jogo boots they were apair of yellow boots amarilloand he got to wear those in action atthe world cup that was a troublesomeworld cup for him everybody was justsuggesting that he was diving androlling over and things like that so itwasn't really great for himwith the kind of pr thing perhaps hejust took another little bit of a hitto his profile as a big star playermoving on nike would give him the vaporsthe vapor 12sthey'd also then give him his speedfreaks and then they would go on fromthat into the last ones that we've seenum the white ones with all the differentneymar logos on it now there's been alot of changes in the nomar logothey've never managed to stick to onething which is a little bit confusingbut it's going to be useful for pumabecause it's anotheranother new logo for neymar he's gone topumaand he's going to get this new logo sothe thing ishe actually had a year left on hiscontract with nike so i'm not surewhat's happened there whether it's gotpaid upum or they've just torn it up or whatthe thing was but neymarisn't getting the position that he wantsto have with nikeso mbappe his teammate at psghe's a bigger deal now to nike thanneymar isand bappe's won the world cup andbappy's got to the final of thechampions leagueobviously neymar was there as well butneymar is playing second fiddle tombappe in the psg team and he doesn'twant to play second fiddle to himat nike so it's a case of well maybehe'll go back to barcelona or somethinglike thatmy question would be is if he goes backto barcelona how is that relationshipbut puma gonna be with griezmann he'sthe headline player with the ultrasnow talking about the ultras we haven'tseen neymar movedirectly into wearing the ultra straightaway i think everybody was expecting tosee that when they hear that he's gonnago to puma it's like okay well he'sgonna be in the ultrasand i think pure have done really wellby putting him in the puma kingsand having this whole the king is backthing i think it's a great bit ofmarketing it's a great bit of stuffthat's pushing people to noticethe puma king platinums now lukaku atinter milan has been banging in thegoalswearing those boots not sure what he'sgoing to be wearing this season but he'sgot a lot of goals wearing those bootsand it's just great to see them on thepitch now the boots that you've seenneymar wearingthey're not actually available at retailand it just seems like they've had torush this out it seems to have beenquite a quick decisionand one of the things and i've got thislittle bit of a kind of inside thoughtthat i'll give you in a secondbut one of the things it seems to berushed out because they've had to getsilny art to come along and there's theblackoutboots and he's whited out the swoosh ofthe little swords the form stripe onthereso then you can see that really standout on pitch and then added on theneymar logo as welland you can see all these custom bootsthey were all blackouts and he'd addedthe white paint to them to be wornso there hasn't actually been any timeto get anything specifically set up forneighbor neymar now talking aboutspecifically set up and talking aboutthose liquid diamonds that i talkedabout before if you see the pink on theswooshon the phantom gts now when nike bringout a new bootthey normally have a headline wearer ican't saythat i can think of anybody who wasreally the headline wearerwhen the phantom gts came out now theycould have used kevin de bruynethey could have used kai hubbards theycould have used lewandowskii mean lowendasies had a mad season ifthey could have got him into those bootsum then he would be in a great kind ofheadline wearer for it they could haveused harry kane who was the headlinewearerfor the phantom venoms now i understandthat kopit 19's been around and it'smade it harder for them to getmarketing materials and things set upbut i just have a suspicionthat nike planned on having neymarheadlinethe phantom gts and this is the kind ofinside kind ofthought that i've got about what's goingon i think that neymar was supposed tofront these boots i thinkthat the way that these are set up itjust reminds me of what they've donewith neymar before and i think neymarwas supposed tofront the phantom gts you will have seenthat neymar did wear the phantom gtsin blackout in training earlier in theyear so they're giving them a goremember that these are on thehypervenom last so that meansthat the way the the sole of the boot isdesigned it is the sameso it's designed to suit the boot thatname our lightyes it comes with a collar it also comeswith the low so it would have made sensethat perhaps they would have been happyfor neymar to wear the low versionand just give him some white socks orsomething to make it look like he waswearing the hibut the other thing is i believe thatnike planned on havinga signature edition phantom gt forneymarit would have come out in the nextmonths or so i believeclearly that's not going to happenanymore but i believe that nike wantedto get neymar into the phantom gts theystill wanted him aroundbut they wanted him to headline theseobviously he's tried themand he's decided he wanted to stick tothat kind of vapor feel of a boothe didn't want to come and use theseboots and it's come to a headand he said you know what i don't wantto carry on and then he's gone to pumathey've had a conversation they'veobviously worked out the money and allthose kind of thingsand he's also getting that recognitionthat he's just not gettingif he goes to puma he's their nightnumber one number two playergriezmann and neymar that's all there isfor puma other playersa little bit further down the lineyou're not talking about um your balletsor james madison'sor players like that even marco royceplayers like that they're just not quitethatelite level when you look at nikethey've got a lot of elite level playersso they've got ronaldo they've gotmbappe they've got sancho to headlinethe mercurialsthey can now just take the vapor and sayyou know what it's just that littlenotchbelow again they can carry on with themarketing their way the way the way theywere beforeobviously it's a slight issue a slightvacuum in what they're doing with thephantom gts but i say come on getlewandowski in them as soon as possiblehe is clearly the headline player forthose he should have won the bang ondoor this yearthe guy won everything possible in thiscalendar yearhe was the top goal scorer in all thosecompetitions and they've taken theballon d'or away from him and i thinkthat's a crying shame because heabsolutely deservesto have won that um and then obviouslyharry kane and a few other players likede bruyne and kylie hubbard now he's atchelsea he's going to stand out a bitmore probablythey're going to be the players thatyou're going to see with the phantom gtsbut i do think that nike originallyplannedto have neymar in them and i think hewas having none of it and i think nowhe's gone to the puma kings how long helasting the puma kings i will besurprised to seei think maybe maybe we'll see a specialedition of the ultras or something maybea super light version or somethingmaybe they'll even tie in and make it aneymar edition but they are going to tryand get himinto those as soon as possible i am surebut it will be interesting to seewhether he likes the design of those itis a lot wider in the forefoot but havea think about itand see what you think neymar i supposehe's got time and um he's gonna have alittle bit of rest seeing as he's gothimself sent offuh in his first game wearing the pumakings right guys uh thank you very muchfor watching please let me know what youthink about neymar and his boot switchwould be interesting one to followthanks for watching go enjoy football,24,UCvn-HVrAGYEKsVx6gW3MeNQ,VH1,312,71,0,3513,"['Ceaser Crashes Quani & Puma’s Date Night', 'Date Night', 'Ceasar and

hubbards theycould have used lewandowskii mean lowendasies had a mad season ifthey could have got him into those bootsum then he would be in a great kind ofheadline wearer for it they could haveused harry kane who was the headlinewearerfor the phantom venoms now i understandthat kopit 19's been around and it'smade it harder for them to getmarketing materials and things set upbut i just have a suspicionthat nike planned on having neymarheadlinethe phantom gts and this is the kind ofinside kind ofthought that i've got about what's goingon i think that neymar was supposed tofront these boots i thinkthat the way that these are set up itjust reminds me of what they've donewith neymar before and i think neymarwas supposed tofront the phantom gts you will have seenthat neymar did wear the phantom gtsin blackout in training earlier in theyear so they're giving them a goremember that these are on thehypervenom last so that meansthat the way the the sole of the boot isdesigned it is the sameso it's designed to suit the boot thatname our lightyes it comes with a collar it also comeswith the low so it would have made sensethat perhaps they would have been happyfor neymar to wear the low versionand just give him some white socks orsomething to make it look like he waswearing the hibut the other thing is i believe thatnike planned on havinga signature edition phantom gt forneymarit would have come out in the nextmonths or so i believeclearly that's not going to happenanymore but i believe that nike wantedto get neymar into the phantom gts theystill wanted him aroundbut they wanted him to headline theseobviously he's tried themand he's decided he wanted to stick tothat kind of vapor feel of a boothe didn't want to come and use theseboots and it's come to a headand he said you know what i don't wantto carry on and then he's gone to pumathey've had a conversation they'veobviously worked out the money and allthose kind of thingsand he's also getting that recognitionthat he's just not gettingif he goes to puma he's their nightnumber one number two playergriezmann and neymar that's all there isfor puma other playersa little bit further down the lineyou're not talking about um your balletsor james madison'sor players like that even marco royceplayers like that they're just not quitethatelite level when you look at nikethey've got a lot of elite level playersso they've got ronaldo they've gotmbappe they've got sancho to headlinethe mercurialsthey can now just take the vapor and sayyou know what it's just that littlenotchbelow again they can carry on with themarketing their way the way the way theywere beforeobviously it's a slight issue a slightvacuum in what they're doing with thephantom gts but i say come on getlewandowski in them as soon as possiblehe is clearly the headline player forthose he should have won the bang ondoor this yearthe guy won everything possible in thiscalendar yearhe was the top goal scorer in all thosecompetitions and they've taken theballon d'or away from him and i thinkthat's a crying shame because heabsolutely deservesto have won that um and then obviouslyharry kane and a few other players likede bruyne and kylie hubbard now he's atchelsea he's going to stand out a bitmore probablythey're going to be the players thatyou're going to see with the phantom gtsbut i do think that nike originallyplannedto have neymar in them and i think hewas having none of it and i think nowhe's gone to the puma kings how long helasting the puma kings i will besurprised to seei think maybe maybe we'll see a specialedition of the ultras or something maybea super light version or somethingmaybe they'll even tie in and make it aneymar edition but they are going to tryand get himinto those as soon as possible i am surebut it will be interesting to seewhether he likes the design of those itis a lot wider in the forefoot but havea think about itand see what you think neymar i supposehe's got time and um he's gonna have alittle bit of rest seeing as he's gothimself sent offuh in his first game wearing the pumakings right guys uh thank you very muchfor watching please let me know what youthink about neymar and his

yeah myname's jayum i've got a full puma um andthis is a little bit about me and thetrack or i guess really[Music]so jake tell me about your car what whatis it you're drivinguh what is it it's a 2000 uhford puma little 1.7 umstarted out as a uh it was a relativelynice car to be fair i still remember theday i bought it i bought it off somelady in chelmsfordand um i could probably take youstraight back to my house actuallybecause i rememberagreed the price and bought it and thenshe wept like a schoolgirlas i was driving off her drivewaybecause i don't think she expected me totake it there and thenshe just bawled her eyes out but i'dlove to take it back to her and gotada look what i've done to this i'veruined itbasically what makes a puma a good trackcarbecause it maybe isn't the obviouschoice it's not and if you were going tobuya ford hatch of that era you would buyan st150 fiestai mean why wouldn't you you get atwo-liter engine you getbetter dynamic chassis dynamics butwhy buy a hatchback when i can buy asporty little coupe i didn't realize atthe time i was buying a hairdresser'scar and probably the mostgirly car my first people was dog meantto be fair and i did uhi did stand out like a sore thumb in iti remember turning up trying to make soi know what i've bought they're likequick back short back and sides perm orsomething like that anduh i don't know they get under your skinwhy makes it a good cartop gear 97 car of the year goodreference i like thatso this is jay's hairdresser's i mean uhtrack car so jay talk us through some ofthe stuff on here like the ironing boardon the back for examplestart with the wig yeah and the arrow soi wanted a big wing kind of don't we alli like i like the look of it but i don'twant something that i could just buy onebay so i wanted something functionalso this was designed bybyc designs uh mark up inup in preston up north proper god'scountry proper god's countryyork shitty and everything so he did thewing and the skirtsoriginally we're going to do the wing ifyou're not with some skirts as well andit's notjust fit and forget you know knocksomething up and build it this is allum cfd testedokay modeled the car cfd i did thesplitter canardsi saw these on a ferrari gt3 car so ithought if it's good enough for themit's good enough for meand i think i think the idea behindthese is it stops air going in the wheelarch and uses the wheel as kind of likean extractorto remove the air the next mod is i seei see the obligatory use of uh cableties yeahmark gave me some of them little nicethings soum yeah the next mod for the aero iswe're gonna vent the wingto release the pressure out the archesyep and i've also gotsome wide arches coming for it butthey're not your standardbolt on round here they're a bit arethey like the racing puma ones orno they're actually so the rears are offa mark v golf british touring carwow okay and the fronts we haven't quiteworked that out yetcarbon fiber bonnet as well yeah

addictshosted what was the last ever trap thereat rockyin november in the november of 2018. umwe've done a fewi pestered the guys at rockingham to letme have the last day they gave it usand it sold out to just a bunch offriendsso everybody on that pit lane knew eachother 60 cars and everybody on that pitlane was friendsit was brilliant that was the best itwas kind of like a great sender forrockinghamuh and it was just yeah it was just agood laugh all around you know nobodywas chasing times nobody was being anidiot everybody knew each other so itwas really friendly and really openthere was no egos or anything like thatand it was just one of them days wherelike a really crispwinter's day when the sun's out it's notparticularly warm but everything's dryand it's just nice it's brilliant yeahgreat great great place rockinghamreally miss ittalking about the mods on the car whatdo you think is your favorite mod youdid to the puma what was thewhat was the thing that made the mostdifference let's say uhwell with the puma you you've got toplay to its strengths it's never goingto be a rocket ship down straight it's130 horsepowerso you do what it does you you you knowyou improve the bits it's already goodat so handlingit wasn't very good at braking so we diduh yeah the brakes were woeful so as isay we had a bit of ahybrid of ford parts from a mondeo orif you want to be really posh jaguar xtype calipers and it uses an st-170 discuh makes it bigger and that was great wehad it on standardi think we just had some ebay discs andpads on it and it worked really well butthe best partwe did was it went uh we worked reallyclosely with tarox brakesand they fired us outside of their raceback you know for sort of fast roadtrackum pads and discs and that justtransformed it it really showed whatsort of difference proper materials canmake on a car umand since then um we've always usedtarox brakes on that car and anythingelse that we kind of classed as a trackaddict fleet so we uhyeah it was that was probably one of thebest things we did on the car just beingable toyou know you can't get down the streetsparticularly quickly so you arrive at aslightly slower speed but being able tocarry that speeddeeper into a braking zone than justreally get on the brakesyeah it really helped yeah then justtaking the weight out of it just to makeityou know brought it along it's um thelotus principlesimplify and add lightness no theforward principle let it rotyeah we'll talk about the track addictfleet so it's obviously not just youbehind the track addict name so who elsehave we got involvedwe've got craig he's got a little cliouh what is it it's cleo 16 valve butit's got two little williams engine initum haley my sister-in-law she's got amazda mx-5 mark 1 turbo

hi everyone Kevin here from golf guyreviews and in this video today I wantedto do a first impressions of the brandnew Puma RSG golf shoes now these arelimited edition spikeless pair of golfshoes from Puma and they are doing a lotof things quite differently compared toyou know a lot of the golf shoes outthere now I wanted to do this firstimpressions video not only to giveeveryone a closer look in regards tosome of the style and design elements ofthis limited edition show but alsoactually so that you know importantlyhow they fit on feet in case you'rethinking about buying them now clearlythis is not my fall of you I've notactually worn these out on the golfcourse yet so I can't tell you howthey're going to perform but what I cantell you is how they fit and fill andbefore we go through any of the detailson the show the first thing I would justwanted to kind of highlight is thatthese shows do seem to come up a bitsmall so I ordered these in a UK 9 whichis my regular size and in a lot of Pumashows they actually seem to come up alittle bit biggertraditionally certainly the NX e Igniterange which is a shoe I wear a lot doeshave quite a bit of room and that seemsto be a little bit longer than normalthese do seem to come up a little bitsmall so if you are considering buyingthe new RSG range I personally wouldrecommend maybe trying them half a sizebigger but definitely see if you can trythem or at least order a couple of pairsto make sure you get a pair that fitsyour feet properly these are still theUK 9 version and I've had to order a 9and a half just and I can get out on thecourse and let you know what theyactually are like to use out on the golfcourse now I definitely want to getthese out in the golf course becausethey've got such a chunky midsole thatI'm just interested to see how theyactually perform and how stable they areout in the course so once I've got apair that fits me right and I've put afew rounds under my belt look out for myfull review video I'll post a link to itabove that's the wrong side I'll post alink to it above and so you know keep alookout for that and I will let you knowwhat they think of these once I've giventhem a four of you but for now this isjust a first look and let's take a lookat some of the design elements of theshow so the Puma RS sneakers have becomea real hit lately because of their boldchunky design and this bold kind ofcolor-block design that they've gotgoing on and the fact that actuallythey're quite affordable so Germanyin the UK for well under a hundredpounds now these golf shoes at themoment retail in the UK for ninetypounds which again is pretty decentprice point when you think of some ofthe night spikeless shows like the MX 1GS they retail at a hundred or even theair jordan spike shoes they retail forwell over 150 pounds so coming in atninety pounds for a limited-edition shoethat's a real good price point sohopefully you'll be able to pick up thepair of these now I also picked up thewhite and grey versions that I've gothere because I thought I'd see whichones I prefer but once they arrived andI put both of them on I definitelypreferred the green and orange versionsI kind of figured that if you're gonnaget a pair of golf shoes that reallystand out and look this different inregards to their chunky design you mightas well make sure that they really lookdifferent nowI've got enough pairs all kind of whitegolf shoes out there and although theselook cool and lows and those are peoplewere going to like these for mepersonally I just fell in love with thegreen and orange the moment I saw himand just decided yet definitely B's andthe ones that I'm going to keepinterestingly with the white and grey Idid run a poll on my social media andthese were the ones which did prove morepopular and don't forget there is ablack version as well and theninterestingly the hill part here is thissilver material actually so there's alittle bit reflection to it I'm not sureif the camera is going to quite pickthat up there but yeah that's definitelysilver rather than gray and there's abit of a metallic look to it and yetthey do look really really cool andreally really clean and fresh butpersonally I just decided that thesewere the ones for me I really hope youenjoyed this video today and you'refinding it helpful so hit that likebutton if you are and if you haven'tdone so already please make sure yousubscribe to my channel so you can keepup to date on all my latest reviews I'vegot shoes clothing and tech right hereand golf guy reviews now the originalversion of the RS running shoes wasactually released back in the 80s and infact RS spends for running system sothere was a version of these shows onmuch move you've seen them before thatactually had a little computer on theback of them way before you had GPSwatches or any technology in the showthat's kind of where the RS system therunning system originated from so theseare based on running trainers and morerecently you know they've been kind ofreworked and redesigned so thisparticular version is based on thex3 or RS x-cube doesnot which way to sayit we've this whole kind of chunkymidsole design and the bold colors so interms of the midsole there you've gotthis very chunky thick midsole there andyou've just got a whole lot of layeredmaterials there in regards to the upperthen this is using a microfiber leatherupper and what Puma have said is thatthey've actually got a thin TPU filmlayer over the topnow I haven't established whether that'sonly over the upper or whether it's overthe midsole doesn't feel like it's overthe midsole so I think maybe it's overthe upper only and let's the help itkeep it clean so again when I get theseout on the course I'll be interested tosee how clean I can keep theseinterestingly as well what Puma havesaid is that this is a seam sealed upperso you can kind of see here on all thekind of areas where you would find theseam you can see that they've over letthe material so you don't have anyexposed seems you've got that on theinside as well there although actuallyI've just spotted there's a seam therealong the outside I'm the biggest kindof part of the rear medial side of theshoe but you know I think that's gonnabe absolutely fine I'm Agustinwaterproofing but people have done thatto make sure these stay as waterproof asthey can be and they are given these aone-year waterproof warranty so it'll beinteresting to see how these actuallyhold up another thing to note on thedesign of the show is that you can seehere that you've got these differentsections of the foam here on the showyou've got both the same on the outsideand on the inside of the show and thepart on the front here you've got tosort a bit of texture to it as well soyou can see these kind of square patternon this part of the foam here and therest is then just kind of smooth thereon the show so just interesting kind ofdifferent design feature as well on theshow a few other designer that's tohighlight and you can see first of allhere that you've got the RSG logo thereon the tongue with a lightweight kind ofthin tongue pull tab on the front thereI'm not sure I'd want to put on that toomuch because that does seem quite thinand you can see here that you've reallygot these chunky laces on the shoe aswell which kind of match the whole kindof chunky vibe that the shoes got goingon now what is really really interestingfor me is actually when you put theseshoes on although they have got thisseriously kind of chunky look initiallyI thought that they're going to haveloadsrooming them but actually they'rethey're quite tight-fitting I mentionedat the very beginning there that thesedo come up small so that's all we're abigger size but in regards to justgenerally the fit and fill on feet theydo feel that they're looking down myfeet quite well my Hill definitely feelsnice and kind of tucked in there on theshow and there's quite a fair amount ofpadding on the ankle area there andespecially on the hill too which reallykind of helps keep it filled like it'slocked in it will be really reallyinteresting to see how these actuallyperformed given that it looks like theykind of sit up extremely high I justwonder where we're gonna be toppingevery shot that I hitbut I'm not entirely sure but we'll seewhen we get these out on the course nowpersonally what I think Puma are reallygoing for with these shows is actuallygoing for a trainer first approach andthen go through second so the idea Ireally think behind this training isthat you can easily wear this off thecourse but if you want to go througharound the Gulf then definitely you canplay some golf in it as well will it bea high-end performance shoe no not atallbut I don't think that's the marketthey're going for I think this is a realgood idea in regards to just kind ofcasual up the world of golf certainlygonna appeal to a younger audience I'mgetting older now and to be honest thisappeals to me I really like it I thinkhe looks a bit more like a dead shoe tobe honest in regards to the chunkinessof it and that's definitely a specificstyle that I know a lot of peoplewatching this video just won't reallylike they'll look at this shoe and gothat's hideous whereas a lot of otherpeople will look at this video and goissues absolutely gorgeous so it'sreally gonna be divisive so let me knowdown in the comments which category doyou fall into do you love it or do youhate it taking a closer look in the shoeand you have got a fusion foam innersole there and you can kind of see hereactually if I highlight it you've gotquite a thick area on the hill therewhich is just adding a little bit ofextra padding and also you can see onthe inside of the shoe there and thekind of instep of the foot you've gotquite a higher raised section as welladding some additional padding andsupport on the inside of the shoe nowthat's really interesting because a lotof golf shoes you get don't necessarilyprovide much support certainly in theirarch area of the shoe there now for mepersonally I don't particularly needthat and I do find that shoes that havegot aggressive kind of real higher archsupport actually end up hurting myyou find up wearing them for quite along time so it will be interesting tosee how I get on with these while we'retalking about the feeling underfootwe'll also take a look at this chunkymidsole foam that you've got here sothis is what Puma are calling theirfusion foam and the whole point of thatis to give you a higher energy returnnow I've not had too much experience tobe honest with the fusion foam with PumaI know they've got the very popularignite foam which I'm a big fan of andwhich is very very soft and gives adecent amount of energy return I've notgot much experience with a fusion foamso you have to wait to my full reviewand I'm letting you know how it feelsout on Kooks in regards to how I feltjust kind of wearing it about the housethen I would say that it's notnecessarily the softest feeling foam outthere at the moment maybe it feels a bitmore like a running shoe rather thanspecifically a very soft squishy foamfor a golf shoe but as I say we'll seehow it performs over 18-hole soon solastly let's take a look on the bottomof the shoe here and you've got thisreckless outsole now this is a carbonrubber combination outsole and you cansee here that you've got a variation ofdifferent kind of lugs so at the fronthere you've got these kind of I supposeslightly conical lug shapes towards thefront and then on the in this sectionhere on the medial side at the front andthe forefootyou've got more square lugs then on thissection here you've got these kind of Isuppose like bracket shapes lugs andthen swords the rear of the shoe you'vegot these circular kind of spikes at theback and then we go back to the samespikes that you've got the front at therear of the shoe here that's a reallyinteresting combination I don't know howmuch specific kind of design has goneinto that or whether it's just in therebecause it looks cool and I've got to behonest that they're not the mostaggressively styled spikeless shows outon the market so again this is whatleads me to believe this is more of acasual leisure kind of golf shoe ratherthan a high-performance golf showthere's not a problem you just need toknow what you're getting when you go inso I don't think I'm gonna have anyproblems with these wearing these out onthe course in regards to the summer andthe spring months and even moving intothe autumn but these are definitely notgonna be a pair of golf shoes that aregoing to provide me maximum tractionwhen the kind of course is starting toget wet out there and definitely I'd begoing for a spike shoe instead sothere's something interestand again I'll let you know how thesegrip out on the course once I do my forreviewinteresting even despite this bottom aswell what I would say about this is thatit does feel very grippy and rubberizedso we've some spikeless golf shoes youknow if you step on a slippery surfaceso they know if you've ever like gotinto a supermarket in a spikeless golfshoe sometimes just slipping all overthe place you've got no tractionwhatsoever these feel that these canactually be used like an everydaytrainer and I'd have no problems wearingthese are most kind of surfaces to behonest and then wearing them out on thegolf course so so they are very veryversatile indeed so there you go that'smy first look and first impressions ofthe brand-new Puma RSG golf shoes I'mreally really looking forward to gettingthese out in the course once I get themin a half a size bigger because you knowthere's no point cramming your foot intoa pair of golf shoes and then findingthem uncomfortable you've got to makesure that you're comfortable firstbefore you go out on the course but onceI've got them shoes I will definitely behitting the golf course and then you cancheck out my

hey this Anthea throws let's see whatyou can watch decide and ride welcome toour detailed breakdown of the new puma500 boots available at revzilla.com thisis the new puma 500 we're placing thedesmo and it comes in two flavors theone I have in my hand is the GTX versioncoming in over that three hundred dollarmark and some I left you can see theregular version non GTX the GTX isgore-tex so again if you're reallylooking at it you can look at it threeto four season full range waterproofboot if you want to go that directionand the way it's designed and styled tome really scream sport and sport touringnow remember you're investing ingore-tex waterproof breathableguaranteed for life it's going to keepMother Nature out if you go thisdirection but also allow your foot tobreathe and allow the sweat to perspirefrom your foot move through the membranekeeping you comfortable while keepingyou dry now if you get the non GTXversion than normal 500 I will tell youthat in a rainstorm you're gonna get wetbut at the end of the day it's still atwo to three to four season boot for amyriad of climates and a lot ofdifferent riding Styles notice it isfull height it's going to be syntheticleather throughout and it carries agreat deal of style and protection fromPuma now when I call it the replacementfor the desmo that is because it is avery very similar boot 90% of the samefunctionality 90% of the same design butthe one key change that they made whenthey went to the 500 vs. the desmo onboth the GTX and non GTX models isreally the entry and exit point it's nowa rear entry and exit you can see I havemy gore-tex version see how high thatGator comes up all the way to the top myregular version is exactly the same andon the previous model you entered andexited through the medial side so on theinside this would be a zipper that wouldgo all the way down you can see thatgore-tex stops that gator on the insideas well I will say we should dive intofit here and the fit is going to be keyand you need to listen upbecause these run differently sizedremember we're gonna ship for free overthirty nine bucks but you got to get itclose to being right use this size chartand whatever your size comes back at goa full size down your Puma 500 fits onefull size large you're gonna feel it inthefoot bed and I will tell you that nowthey've gone to a rear entry and exitthere's actually a lot of extra roomhere as well so one of my grapes mightbe that there's a little bit of extraroom around the ankle and then if welook at the top of this boot it isabsolutely massive and there's a lot ofadjustability around the calf so if youhave huge ankles if you have huge calf'sthis is actually a phenomenal option butit does run large and even if you'rebuying the right size you're still gonnahave a little bit of room to move we'llcall it that but remember you use a sizestart go back a full size or go down afull size it's gonna have a lot of roomfor expanse on the calf but the keything that homed in on is use a sizechart and go a full size down it fitsone size large remember as I said we'regonna ship for free over 13 bucks and asI always click our logo subscribe to usat RevZilla TV I love to hear commentsyour questions and your feedback on thenew Poobah 500 and 500 GTX now divinginto some of the nuance of the boot youalready heard me talk about the factthat synthetic leather throughout andyou can see here I have my 500 GTX in myhand this is the only color availableit's black it has orange accents and theorange and it's going to have a titaniumor reflective Puma stripe along theoutside so again you're getting a littlebit of extra functionality if you gowith the regular 500 it actually doesn'thave the orange and the black and thePuma stripe is just gonna be blacked outyou look at some of the other featureshere notice it does have a zinc back toeslider and actually comes with twotoasts sliders this is the short versionthere's also a longer version it isreplaceable it has zinc on the outsideand I'm gonna call this out it gave methat longer slider thinking that youmight stretch it into the track you'renot taking this boot to the track thisboot is a sport and sport touring bootit is not a track boot regardless of theheight keep that in mind that is myrecommendation take it to the track atyour peril and the reason is because itneeds additional support up the lateraland medial side that is absolutely whereI come down on this great for sporttouring riding but again not gonna holdup in two types of scenarios you'regonna put it through from a supportstandpoint or protection standpoint atthe track now if we look at some of theother pieces that are baked in here Iactually like the toe reinforcement alot and I like how they've designed thisreinforced area of TPU that comes allthe way up the front toe counterreinforces the front of the toe and thengives you that big shift panel the othernice part of you have a reallyhi arch is the bellows are immense inthis boot so there's a lot offlexibility remember we talked about alot of room in the ankle but there's alot of height if you have one of thosehigher arched feet this is gonna doreally well for you moving around to theback what you can't see is they're aboutthe size of the quarter but you do havemalleolus protectors on the lateral sideand on the medial side you can see thisis the gore-tex version so it saysgore-tex on the outside and one of thethings I really like is they steel theheel right off the v4 and if you workyour way in here you see dual durometerheel so we see our TPR we see our TPUthere's a zinc heel counter along theback that's going to be that area forslide massive and protective this is oneof the features that they get the mostright here on the 500 and the 500 GTX ishow they've baked in the protectionaspect into the heel if you move alongthe inside you're gonna see similarmaterials again synthetic leather amixture of textile as you work your wayback there's also at the top of the shinhere going to be another little pop ofTPR which is going to be just anotherinterface point with your bike dependingon how you ride also give you a littlebit more protection and the shin is kindof in this mid-range for me where I wishit had a reinforced hard part baked onthe inside or I really wish that thisTPU went up a little bit higher theycould do a little bit bigger of a jobhere but I'm not really complaining inthat 300 dollar range for gore-tex andthis amount of functionality I actuallythink there's a ton of bang for the buckhere now the other thing to keep in mindis the durometer factor of the soleremember it's going to be a dual densitydurometer you have it spaced out alittle bit further for walking around inthe parts of your bike that are a littlebit less tactile or responsive whenyou're riding and if you move up hereinto the ball of the foot what's gonnainterface with your peg depending on howspiritedly you ride you're gonna get alittle bit of a tighter configurationand a little bit of a different diameterfor a little bit of a different feedbackso all in you're looking at the GTXversion at the 500 coming in over 300bucks you have the regular versioncoming in the high twos sports fortouring carrying the Puma style out ofGermany and it's nice to see themredefine and redesign a little bitmoving forward next iteration I'd liketo see them make some of the sweepingchanges that address some of the fitissues but it's nothing you can't getover if you heed my advice and just usethe size chart and take a step back downto a lower size go one full size lowerand it should fit your spot on the nextstep of your journey is that click righthere read other rider reviews of theyou Puma 500 and 500 GTX you don't haveto take my

English thatmeans it's going to be very difficult toget an ankle injury in these boots verydifficult almost impossible like I saida lot of Technology built in here I'mgoing to move the forward part of theboot and you're going to see hopefullyEric and zoom in and catch this thebottom portion of the ghost doctor ismoving back and forth in that pocket orperhaps channel if you will there arestops at the back and at the front sothat the ankle moving you know flexingforward and back it cannot go beyond itsnatural range of motion at the bottom ofthe ghost doctor it's about a quarter ofan inch if you will away from a channeland what this does if you're trying toroll your ankle or if you know you crashand it's it's compressing your ankleit can't pronate or supinate beyond itsnatural range of motion because what isgoing to happen is this bottom part ofthe ghost doctor will hit that channeland essentially stop which is good thePuma boot is going to protect your ankleankle from injury in all four directionseach each range of motion iswe cover the back of the boot here theheel cup the refer to that is thecockpit okay inside there's quite ameasure of padding to reduce injury fromhigh side if you're flying through thearea land on the heel there's a goodamount of protection padding built inthere so you're not going to come downwith a heel injury item I'm going toopen this clasp up here I'm going topull this back I'm going to show you theinterlacing system that's here this is agood quality interlacing systemI like the clasp that comes with itlooks like it's great quality I don'tthink we have any issues with thateitherthis is probably one of the better onesthat I've seen on the market so farliked it quite a bitin order to put this boot on you need tofirst loosen this up all the way makesure you're in a lacing system is openedup all the way because when you'retrying to get past the cockpit area toboot the heel cup that's going to needto be undone all the waste and get yourfoot to dip in I've got a boot over herethat I've already begun to do that withI'm going to show you how it goes on thevery top portion of the boot attached tothe boot carcass we've got a nice littleloop here you're going to need toutilize that in order to put the boot ongo ahead and slide your foot in holdingon to that and I like to grab thecarcass of the boot as well is kind ofhold it in placepulling up lightly foot dips right inthe first thing you're gonna notice isoh my god is this thing comfortable onthe insidegrab your lacing system in the back giveit a nice little tug boom on the outsideof the boot we have a little velcropatch here put that there it keeps thelaces out of the way take the backportion of the boot push it forward nowyou bring this the ghost doctor backtake a ski boot style closurebring it around put it through the latchpull it over there is a very wide rangeof adjustment here this strap isactually quite long with many teeth Ithink this is going to accommodate mostanyone you know whether you have thincalves or some larger calves there'sgoing to be a lot of adjustment there Ithink it's going to work for everyoneyou can also give a final adjustmentonce you've got the boot on just likethat what I did is I held the front ofthe boot the shin guard and the ghostdoctor and then I just kind of pushedback on the strap it clicked right init's nice and snug now what I'm gonna dois I'm going to stand up and I'm goingto try and pronate or supinate my anklethat is all the movement I can get outof it they don't feel over it onlymechanical they're quite comfortableright out of the box it's a brand newpair that I literally just put on theseare size 45 euro they're marked elevenand a half us ironically the shoe that Ikicked off is a DC it's an eleven and ahalf I would say the sizing for theseboots is spot-on so whatever size you'rewearing your normal street shoe aconsistent size for you order the sameUS size for these boots and I thinkyou're going to be good to gooverall we're going to give the Puma1000 boots a definite two thumbs up wethink we've got a very high qualitytop-end boot here they're fairlyexpensive you know kind of like the CDvertigo Corsa boot we feel the qualityin the protection level is absolutely onpar with the CD boot and in someinstances it may be a little bit betterone of the things I think that that goesa level above the CD is the ankleprotection the CD allows for movement inone direction but not the other wherethe Puma boot protects you from bothsupination and pronation which is goodpersonally I really gravitate towards aboot that will not allow my ankle toroll in either direction that'ssomething that's very important to meall the external parts you see on theboot here you know from the ghost doctorto the strap anything that's bolted onthe toe sliders they're all replaceablePuma has them all in stock even thespeed lacing system the back can bereplaced if it needs to be the onlything that cannot be replaced in theevent of damage will be the actualleather part of the boot the bootcarpets itself well you know if thatthat's excellent I mean there's a lot ofboots out there that don't have thatmany replacement parts the only otherboot company I know that does is C sothey've kind of match that model that'sa good thing the warranty on these bootsis a full one yearwarranty from data purchase that's goodthrough Puma a lot of times they canrepair the boot for youyou know if you have some parts thatneed to be replaced and send the bootout they can get it fixed up get theboots back to you at a relatively lowexpense these are available in amultitude of colors the only two that wehave here right now are the one I'mholding and the one I have on my footlike I said sportbiketrackgear.com weare given the Puma 1000 road racingboots to thumbs up all the way if you'relooking for a high-end high performanceboot that has all the technology andprotection built in I would say look nofurther click today and

hijacob and this is christmas in unisportepisodenumber eleven where we're here inhelsinki now rock in germany for a bitof a history lesson because today i'mgonna take you through the historyof adidas and puma well it all startedhere in hatchernarak in 1924 where the two brothersadolf and rudolph dassler started thegabriella dassler chufa parkin the basement of their mother'slaundry factoryand business was pretty goodunfortunately things went sour betweenthe two brothers because during theworld warii and an allied bomb raid adolf and hiswife went into a bomb shelter whererudolf and his family were alreadysittingand there addie said referencing thealliesthe dirty bastards are back again butunfortunatelyrudolph thought that he meant rudolphand his family and got really angryat his brother so in 1948the two brothers split up the gebrudadaslaschuferbrecht creating two companies oftheir ownrudolf created ruda rudolph dasslerbut eventually renamed it into puma aswe know todayand a year after in 1949 adolfaddy as people called him created adidasshort for addie dassler and it reallymeant that henceforthherzogenaurach would be known as thetownof the bed next why simply because whenpeople met you they would look downon your shoes to see what brand it wasbeforedeciding whether they wanted to speak toyou or notand today i'm wearing pumastrue story now addy dassler went on todo his thing and in 1954 he invented thefirst pair of football bootswith screw-in studs that actually helpedthe german national teamwin the world cup simply because theyhad an advantageplaying on the wet pitch so in 1979adidas introduced the copa mundial whichstill lives on today and is probablyrecognized as one of the all-timeclassicsof the game now although i'm standing infront of adidas here in the center ofherzegovina iraqrecently they actually moved theirheadquarters to the outskirts of thecity where they have ahuge campus with their headquarterswhich is exactly like puma becauserudolph decided to move his company tothe other sideof the river alright really splittingthe city intotwo and setting up his headquartersthere and speaking of the headquartersthis is exactly where i am the pumaheadquarters in hazzo although this isthe moremodernized version it has to be setanyway since rudolph split from hisbrother we have really seen some reallygood stuff among themthe puma king of course which is alsoclassified as one of the classicsof the game and was worn by ucbo andpelethemselves now speaking of pele and thepuma king there was a funny littleincident just before the kickoffin the 1970 world cup final where pelewent up to the refereejust before he blew his whistle andasked if he could tie his boots and ofcoursehe could he was a star and then becausethe tv cameras were already rollingthe whole world got a super close-up ofpele's puma kingspretty cool story but then as they saythe restis history but to think that twobrothers could start a smallcompany 90 years ago that would go on tobecome among the biggest sports brandsin the world now that's a funny thoughtand the coolest thing is that they'rebasically still locatedin each other's backyard here in herzoghertogo nauracnow that was the history lesson fortoday because i think i'm going to enjoythe rest of my dayhere at the puma headquarters and i'llsee you guys tomorrow here in christmasin unisport signing offhere we go jolter joelwhere you at cool sorry bro coolawesome awesome,17,UCLQZTXj_AnL7fDC8sLrTGMw,RevZilla,16,1,0,54,"['Puma 1000 v3 boots', 'puma motorcycle boots', 'puma race boots', 'motorcycle race boots', 'revzilla', 'motorcycle', 'review', 'puma 1000 v3', '1000 v3 boots', 'RevZillaTV', 'sky', 'Shoes', 'video', 'porsche', 'cup', 'motorcycle handlebars', 'tcx', 'sv650', 'sv1000', 'super', 'starbar', 'sport touring', 'sneaker', 's-race', 'rxq', 'rx-q helmet', 'rx-q', 'road riding', 'riding', 'race', 'puma desmo boots', 'puma desmo', 'puma', 'tcx s-race boots', 'motorcycle review', 'tcx s-race', 'mark gardiner', 'kawasaki', 'helmet', 'german', 'desmo boots', 'desmo', 'track', 'cruiser customizing', 'creds']",Puma 1000 v3 Boots Review at RevZilla.com,uslP6Wl3qsA,46119

[Music]hello my name is stefan munsinger i'mthe manager for ford performance ineuropeand today i want to introduce theall-new puma sti'll give you some technical insight ofwhat this car is all about[Music]now what's special about it it's thefirst suv in the european fordperformance lineup and we target itto create a car that combines the urbanutility the day-to-daypracticality of an suv with the astinasand the fun to drivefun to drive being the overarchingpremise of any ford performance productso on the exterior the first thing thatreally stands out is the colorit's a mean green it's a color which isuh unique to puma sdand pumast also features a high glossblack exterior theme so certain partsare always in hydros blackstarting with the roof this particularcar has a panel roof but non-paneralvehicles havepainted black roof as standard and thetheme continuesinto the rear wing side spearsand mirror caps so the black themecontinues to the frontwe have the st logo embedded in thefront grilleand then there is a part i want to pointout to you which is thefront splitter here it's an additionalpart that's mounted to the bottom of theof the bumper it's unique for stso it's an aerodynamic part it improvesdrag reduces the drag at the same timeincreases downforceso from an aerodynamic perspective it'sreally a bit of a win-winand besides that attribute effect thevisual appearanceis pretty cool differentiates the car ireally like this part in particularthe ford performance letters on top ofittwo things i want to point out at therear of the car we have a uniquedefuser for st and the exhaustpretty clean honest design your dualpipe stainless steel slash cutno fake features like some of thecompetitors haveand the exhaust features a valve so thevalve depending on drive mode and drivecondition opens up and itamplifies the raspy i3 sound and whenyou start revving this thing it actuallysounds pretty cool okay so let's talkaboutthe wheels the vehicle comes standardwith 19-inch alloyson two 25-40 tires the rim design thetwo different ring designs there is amagnetite matte painted rim and thenthere is a machinedversion of this rim and this particularcar has the machined rimon the tire it's a michelin pilot 4stirepart of the michelin high performancetire lineup and we developed this tiretogether with michelin specifically forpuma stand there's actually a ford performanceimprinton the tire on the sidewall fp whichindicates that this specification isparticular for puma st and that's a tirethat you can also getvia the michelin aftermarket channelsso let's talk about some of theessential ingredients that actuallymake it an stthe engine it's a 1.5 liter ecoboostwith a manual transmissionit's based on a fiesta sd so it's an i3engine boostedwhich provides a pretty good balancebetweenperformance and efficiencywe upped the torque from 290 newtonmeter in fiesta stto 320 newton meter in puma stand we also shortened the final driveratio slightly to compensate for thelargerwheels so as a result we're gettingpretty good acceleration performancezero to 100 is at 6.7 seconds and vmaxis at 220 kphwe also offer an optional quive limitedslip differentialfor improved front end tractionthe quive in combination with torquevectoring also depending on the drivemodesactually provides really good roadholding and avoids understeer behaviorthere's another key ingredient i need tomention to you which is the brake systemwe actually upsized the brake systemsignificantly versus base pumait has a 325 millimeter disc in thefrontso these brakes really provide sustainedbraking performance also when you'retaking it on the trackwe did take this car to the nurburgringquite a bit during its developmentand the brake system actually behavedquite well out therenow on driving dynamics so obviouslythis car is an suv with a higher centerof gravityso we had to be innovative and clever todeliver thest type driving dynamics so startingwithanti-roll bar in the front a twist beamin the rear which is about 50stiffer versus base pumaand we achieve this by a thickeru-profile and also an addedtorsion bar into the new profile of thetwist beamthen we have unique stiffer bushes allaround on the suspensionwe have a unique knuckleon the car to get us to the road centerwhere we want it to beand also improves the steering ratio andwe haveunique springs and shocks shocks arefrom itachi twin tube in the frontmonotube in the rearthe shocks feature an frd systemfrequency responsive dampeningwhich helps to improve rolling plushnesswhen you're going over smallinputs or rough road surfaces but at thesame timethe shocks have the control that withthe dampening and the control that wewant for an st when you go over biggereventsand then steering steering key for anysti mentioned the knuckle unique geometrybut we also have a uniquesteering rack with a quicker ratio soknuckle in combination with the uniquerack overall delivers a 25 percentquicker steering ratio so the steeringresponseturn in response is actually exceptionalof this carit's key for any st and this carprovides great connected feel so estinasis one thingbut this car remains to offer the suvpracticalityflexible load department withbest-in-class trunk spaceand of course the innovative megaboxwhich features another 80 liters ofadditional storage volumewhich easily fits your most importantgearlet's take a look at the interiorfirst thing that greets you are the fordperformance cuff bladesinside the car the recaro seats areanother key ingredient for stnice side bolstering to provide optimumsight support and also the micro dynamicfabric provides good grip and actuallyalso feelsquite nice and we have metal graystitchingall around a unique gear shift knob ondstwith a red lettering and then thesteering wheel flat button steeringwheel with the sd logo on the bottomand drive mode switches directly on thesteering wheelwe have four drive modes in st echonormal sport and crack now they can beselected by amode button on the steering wheel whereyou basically togglethrough the drive modes and then selectthe oneyou want or there is also an sbutton on the steering wheel it's adirect sport select button so wheneveryou press that buttonyou directly and instantly go into sporti like to call it the fun buttonand typically where you would use thisis when you drive on the road and yousee some somecorners coming and you say okay i wantto do these corners in sport mode maybeand you just simply push it and theninstantly you're in that modeso quite a lot of stuff comes standardon sd it's things like heated seatssteering wheel heated front windshieldparking sensors front and rear 19-inchalloysand then on the interior we have recaroseats standardthere are three optional packs on pumast there's a performance pack whichcontains the quivelsd and launch control and then there isa driver assistancepack and then last but not least thereis a special x packagewhich contains the machined rims and ledheadlampsso this concludes my walk around ofpumasd first europeanford performance suv i hope you enjoyedand learned a bit more about the carwe think it nicely combines the utilityand style of an suv with a stinus andfun to driveorders can be placed from septemberonwards and deliveries will actuallystart right

ray[Music][Music][Music][Music][Applause][Music][Music]oh my baby[Music]I wrote the version that I had withoutthe arrangements maybe five to ten yearsago on my uncle's rooftop I took a nap Iwoke up and I'm like man how can I likethis feels great like how can I put thisdown and you know I'm putting notestogether and just speaking to where Iwas at the time it was like back in theday when I was you know I was learninghow to play guitar through writing songsand never stopped playing the guitarwhen I was writing when I come up withthe line I would just sing that lineover and over and over again until thenext line came you know I'd like to tryto allow it to come you know in a waythat is a little bit less academic moretrue to how I'm feeling well I had noidea what I was doing I was sayingthings over and over get kicked out ofthe living room like the games on okaycome back one of the jobs I don't getyou come and get your colors out here tome what drives colors and like the inthe recorded version of it and whyeverything is so sparse until the chorusis because it's driven by the way inthat he plays guitar while we wererecording you know you do sometimes onyour first pass like a guide scratchvocal they said Oh we'll come back andredo that correctly but he had said thesame thing about the guitar and he waslike oh you can just you know redo thatand I remember one time he I was in thestudio by myself trying to play all thissong I've been playing a lot longer thanand I also know how to play with myfingers like he does that's how Istarted but I remember sitting there andtrying to play all his parts as I justthere's just something about the way heplays that I you know it's it's it'scompletely unique we were in Europe andwe must have played out remember sevensix seven countries despite the languagebarrier despite whatever man when theythat chorus of colors comes out theysang it in every country like the entirevenue sang that chorus in every countrythey may not get the verse you know itmay be like like Eric's I was like akung fu movie they're kind of trying tosing but man he wrote something that'sso universal and people attach their ownmeaning to it that it's it's incredibleto seeto be you know some people havedifferent interpretations of the songslyrically but they put their own meaningto it and it just unites a room in 2017a mutual friend named Brian rayintroduced Eric and myself and we wouldget together in the studio we work onsongs that kind of leisurely paced oncea week maybe once every couple weekssometimes we'd get excited do two days aweek and we really had no exact noteagenda or plan it was just for fun youknow we're both the types that arealways working on music and I think bythat close to the end of the year I knowI was getting you know chills and kindof hair on my back was standing up but Ithink we both just discussed well whatif we like played some of these songslive and made it an official band and weeventually came up with the name I thinkI emailed Steve Wertheimer from owner ofthis amazing venue that we are at seaBoys in Austin Texas and see if he wouldgive us a gig and he offered us aresidency so really the goal at first wejust said let's see if our friends comeand let's see if people have fun let'ssee if anybody cares and likes themtunes as much as we dolife is just life is king[Music]do my plane to keep take me far sincethe manto the farm keep in therethe soon[Music]fine[Music]how fast you go we all share limber nolike the stars in the night so cast adream and watch it die[Music]maybecome on fireI tried to let my soul[Music][Applause][Music]mainly[Music]get down the street[Music][Music]your lifespan[Music][Music][Music][Applause][Applause][Music][Applause][Music]confines was one of the instrumentaltracks that I had already recordedbefore I met Eric and I don't I actuallydon't think I showed it to him at firstI didn't think it was one that scene Icould kind of tell the ones he was hewas really kind of inspired by they theywere all kind of um had a little bitmore of a head nod thing but butconfines I wasn't totally confidentabout showing it to him but I alwaysreally remember liking that theinstrumental version of that and I and Ishowed that to Eric and I remember againhe we have this you know so far and he'seither brought songs that werecompletely you know almost finished wejust had to arrange them or or he one ofthe methods I used to call the EricBurton method was a he'd come to thestudio sometimes sometimes he would comewith Larry sometimes I would just rolland loop the song and he'll justfreestyle and freestyle and come up withlyrics and then we'll just you knowevery once in a while I'd say like thatwhat is that line right there and thenand then he'll just keep rolling but Iremember him telling me you know row rowrow your boat and I was like yeah and hesaid I got something based off of that Iwas like all right so I'm just stuffI'm just didn't record and letting himdo his things as a human being we go wehave our major ups and downs throughoutlife is like you know it's just kind ofa vibe where you know were these evermoving frequencies that need to bereminded sometimes to remain economistand so confines is you know just alighthouse back to the the middle youknow not not super up or super down butjust right here and equanimity is kindof like a you know that's what isinspired byvan Gogh that they said that he wouldsneak into the into museums andgalleries with paintbrushes and justkeep like keep Vic you know keep likewanting to make it better and I meanhe's just like striving to constantlyconstantly right and we don't stop tolike basket anything too long areas likeI don't write a better song than thatyou know so we've definitely challengingourselves to be better all the timeoh man you know it's never done it'snever done how I know when it's done iswhen Adrian says art I gotta make dinnerfor my for my kids you know I gotta goso that's kind of like you know it's myit one of my favorite things aboutworking with Adrian is that like youknow he's got this thing where he's gotthe knowledge and knows a lot of thehistory of some of the music that weboth really truly love that we're ableto make choices that count in the studiokind of in a short period of timewhere I can come in and do what I do andyou know and you know just learn fromsomeone who's been in the industry forso long to just call it you got it he'slike you got to know when to fold themyou got no one to hold them you know hecan't you know keep right on it all daylong but I'm learning that like it'sbetter to just okay that's the take herewe go move on to the next thingmake the next song better as far as apartnership goes I'm very used tothriving very well and relationshipswith people where it's interdependentand I could say that on a professionallevel that adrian has his lane and he'slike a beast in that Lane and I thinkone of the reasons why such a greatproducer and a holder of space isbecause it doesn't try to do things thathe's not good at you know I mean if Iwere him and I made those instrumentalsI'd be like well I'm singing on thislike you know but Adrian's the kind ofperson that like knows how to keep hislane and for an eccentric you knowsongwriter such as myself you know who'sjust very easy for me to take ideas thatI haveand just feelings that I have and justnot care not have any boundaries aboutyou know presenting those and I thinkthat you know this goes outside of musicadrian has a way of just holding spacefor that kind of like controlled chaosthat is you know trying to come up withsomething fresh what carries thisdynamic is the love and passion that wehave for music and developingrelationships that you know lasts[Music][Music][Applause][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Applause][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]that one was one of the early earlytunes we worked on I love that thatrecorded version but but when we startedplaying as a band we brought it to lifeI like actually at this point I likethat they're both two different almostlike two different songs with meyou know they know you better on thealbum is a little bit more like I don'tknow just kind of cruising in your carslowly just kind of starts floating upinto the sky but you're still cruisingyou didn't notice that you're not on thestreet anymore but the live version wetook the energy we added this hold andbeing to it that that um has kind ofturned it into almost a whole differentsong the lyrical idea came from going tomy first Austin party amidst peopledoing like you know drinking alcohol anddoing whatever their drug of choice sowhen someone just stands up and goesokay everybody let's take a sky breakand I was like what is that what doesthat mean so I guess you know I learnedthat it meant to just kind of take amoment to just be on this rock

hi this is Emily from the off-trackfamily hope you're doing fine today inthis video we will show you how to dothe engine oil change of your defenderbefore starting the work here are someinformation on which type of oil we useand why of course we can only recommendto follow the Land Rover specificationoil so in the workshop manual you canread sae 5w30 fully synthetic the fordrecommendation for the 2.4 p.m. ourengine is w SS m2 c 9 1 3 B but thisFord reference is difficult to find soif you take a 5w30 fully synthetic itshould be finealso the ford reference change throughthe years so for the same oil you canfind either w SS m2 c 9 1 3b or w SS m2c 9 1 3 c now why are we using 5 w 44years and not a 5w30 oil the majordifference between the 5w30 and the 5 w40 is the temperature range so you mightthink about it depending on the climatezone you are located in or where youplan to go the SAE 5w30 goes from minus30 degrees Celsius to plus 30 degreesCelsius and the SAE 5w 40 goes fromminus 30 degrees celsius to plus 40degrees Celsius the 5w 30 + 5 w 40 havethe same negative temperatures range butthe 5w 40 positive range can supporthigher temperatures and as you probablyknow the pure mind ring can frequentlybe subject to overheating especiallywhen the ECU has been remapped so wedecided to use the 5w 40 because it'snot unusual for us todrive long distances on highways atabout 120 or 130 km/h with our fullyloaded camper by 35 degrees Celsius andsometimes even more even though wesolved our overheating problem we preferto use the 5w 40 oil for those reasonsof course we ask a professional aboutour choice and he said it's a goodchoice in our case because we have a 2.4TDCI puma engine without the particlefilter concerning the 2.2 TDCI pumaengine he recommends to use the 5w30 inany cases anyways we are using the 5w 40for several years now we have drove morethan 160 kilometers and many times witha heavy loaded defender for our journeysof about 5 K kilometers sometimes morein a matter of one to three weeks and wecan say that our engine is fine but asit's not the Land Rover recommendationwe prefer to let you follow the workshopmanual and use the 5w30 if likers youthink it makes sense to use the 5w 40for your location with higher temps itwill be at your own riskso please do ask a professional beforeif you plan to use a different oil thanthe one written in your workshop manualnow concerning the oil change the mostimportant thing is to change completelythe drain plug the oil filter and theo-ring with new ones every time youchange your oil we change our oil every10 K kilometres if you have an extremeuse of your defender you can change itevery 5 K kilometres but that's aconsequence budget the workshop manualsays to change it every 10 K kilometresfor severe use with all that said let'sstart the work[Music][Music][Music][Music]Kalamata little,26,UCEaTAQbuyJ_FWOOQ5OsbK5A,Shop Zappos,3,0,0,39,No Tags,PUMA Tarrenz SB SKU: 9246455,PfaWvkRXqWM,7271
undoubtedlythe puma is one of the most remarkablearmored infantry fighting vehicleprograms todayapart from its superior technologies itdiffers from its counterpartsin use with its different concept likeany newbornthe puma has some weaknesses evaluationson its superioritiesand weaknesses may provide us someimportant clues for armored infantryfighting vehicles in the futureas the weapon detective we'reinvestigating what the puma tells usplease don't forget to subscribe to ourchannel before we startdupuma is the fruit of the noyagapanzada platformenshortly ngp project initiated by thegerman armyin the mid-1990s the project aimed todesign a common basetracked vehicle which would havedifferent models such as inventoryfighting vehiclepersonnel carrier and weapon carrierthe german general staff wanted avehicle that providessimilar ballistic protection to tanksuntil those yearsit was generally considered sufficientfor track armored vehicles to beresistant to 14 and a half millimetersin front and 7.62 millimeters armorpiercing ammunition on the sidesprotection against land mines and iedswas not on the agenda as it is todayhoweverit will be wrong to see the puma as apioneer in this fieldfor many years israel has beensuccessfully usingand modifying the chassis of the t55and sentryon tanks into heavy armoredpersonnel carriersin addition amraps had been serving fora long timeespecially in the south of africa butuntil thennato army's interest in such vehiclesremainedat an economic level even the us armybegan to show interest in vehicles withlow ballistic protectionand high air transportability at thesame datesdue to the changing military perceptionswith the end of the first cold warmany experts around the world advocatedthis new conceptand many articles were published statingthat active protection systemswill replace passive armor in thisenvironmentit was really interesting that germanydecided to work on a vehicle with highballistic protectionyet it was seen in first studies thatthe new vehiclewould have a weight between 55 and 70tonsif it remained within the specifiedballistic protection criteriaproducing such a vehicle would entailhuge costsalso although germany didn't find theconcept feasiblelike an unarmored armored vehicle itagreed with the usa about the airtransportabilitytherefore it was decided that the newvehicle will have a modular structurein this way the vehicle which would becapable of being transported by thea400mcould be equipped with an additionalarmor in a short timeand would be able to provide highballistic protectionwithin the scope of this project twoleading land system companies of germanycross mafi wegman and rymetalstarted work together and founded ajoint companythe five pre-production vehicles weredelivered in 2006 for trialsaccording to initial plan the serialproduction order was supposed to beconfirmedin 2007 but was postponed to 2009due to technical problems on histransmission and running gearat the beginning of the program germanyhad planned to order 405 pumashowever technical problems were not yetovercomefor this reason by 2012it was decided to be delivered 10 pumaswhose availability will only be testedand improved if necessarythe first two serial production modelsof dupuma were delivered in 2010.with the increase in cost as a result ofall these delaysberlin decided to reduce the number ofvehicles to be suppliedto 350 in 2012.after eliminating some defects in thevehicle in 2015the puma officially entered service withthe german armythe puma's three-man crew consists of acommandergunner and driver the vehicle can alsocarry sixinfantries it has two protection levelsprotection level a is the basic vehiclewhich has 31.45 tons combat weightthe combat weight of the protectionlevel c configurationis 43 tons puma is 7.6 meter long3.9 meters wide and 3.6 meter highthanks to the 1088 horsepower mtu892 k501 enginethe vehicle can reach 70 kilometers perhourits maximum road range is 600 kilometersthe main gun the 30 millimeter mark30-2 abm and the 5.56 millimetermg4 auxiliary machine gun are housedin the remote controlled weapon stationthe basic vehicle can be transported bythe a400min protection level a it is frontallyprotected against rpgsand 30 millimeter ammunitions in thisconfigurationpuma can provide all-round protectionagainst 14.5 millimeter ammunitionsthe vehicle can withstand againstlandminescontaining explosives 10 kilograms oftntin protection level c the vehicle isequipped with an additional armor plateweighing approximately 11.5 tonsthe additional armor package can beintegrated onto pumain three to four hours in fieldconditionsthanks to this package the puma becomesresistantto 30 millimeter ammunition all aroundwhile the roof armoris able to withstand artillery or mortarbombletsalthough some sources claim that puma'sfront armor is resistant to120 millimeter ammunition thisinformation is unrealisticin addition to passive protection thevehicle is supported by the musssoft-killed active protection systemthis 360 degree effective systemthen its laser and radar warning systemsdetect a potential threatmakes it difficult to detect the vehicleby electro-optic sensorsby launching multi-spectrum smokegrenadesit is also concerned that the puma willbe equipped with a hard collectiveprotection systemin the future in order to reduce theinfrared signatureexhaust gases are mixed with fresh airand release into the atmospherealso the vehicle has a design whichreduces its radarand infrared signature the originallyplanned protection level bwas dropped because the puma alsocomplies with the rail loadingdimensionsin protection level c in order to have asimilar mobility with the lapper 2main battle tanks the puma is equippedwith an engine of approximately1100 horsepower alsoit is equipped with the hydro-pneumaticsuspensionshowever the tests show that the vehicleneeds some improvement on thetransmissionto achieve this goal in additionthe number of road wheels which is 5 inpre-production modelshas been increased to 6 in massproduction models to increase mobilitythanks to the independent commander'speriscope puma hashunter killer capability the remotecontrol weapon stationis supported by an advancedstabilization systemthe turret automatically engages itselfwith the targetand the gunner can fight it while thecommander searches for other targetsthe mark 30-2 abn gun can fire30 millimeter programmable ammunitionwhich offer high efficiency against theenemy troopshiding behind the walls and trenches byburstingwithin a determined distance it wasunderstood in a short timethat the 5.56 millimeter secondary gunwas insufficient to provide the expectedfirepowertherefore it was decided to replace themg4with a 7.62 millimeter mg5 machine gunin the future in addition the spike lranti-tank missiles will be integratedonto the pumain the future these missiles have aneffective range of 4000 metersand can be used in fire and forget orfire and observe modesthe twin launcher spike lr is adapted tothe side of the turretthe integration of the anti-tank missileonto the vehicleis expected to take up to five yearsthe puma is the first tracked armoredvehicle designedbased on a new concept for europe forthis reasonthere are many difficulties in thedevelopment process and it was naturallyexposed to many criticismsthe vehicle can only be transported inprotection level aby a 400m military transport aircraftin standard use three basicconfiguration pumasand three protection level c kits aretransported byfour a400ms thereforeits transportation cost is one thirdhigher than its predecessorthe martyr in addition there is theeffort for disassemblyand assembly of the modules anotherdisadvantagethat occurs in this case is that a pumain protection level a configurationcan reach full combat capacity afterthree to four hours of operationafter being transported from the air tothe mission areadelays have increased the program andunit costsvaluable expectations for germanywhere military spending has brought amajor political debatesince the second world war this costincreaseis more of a problem than othercountriesgermany's desire to get rid of themilitary's appearancewhich has been going on for almost 75years also creates some bureaucraticobstaclesthat are not found in many othercountries for exampleaccording to german law the puma musthave a design suitable for pregnantsoldiersnaturally the first question that willcome to mindis what a pregnant soldier is doing inthe conflict zoneor military drill attempting to meetsuch a strange criterion brings with itadditional costsdue to its innovative design puma is anexpensive systemmaking it difficult to find newinternational customersit is also more difficult to find acountry that would prefera more expensive vehicle as it issuitable for pregnant soldiersas the debate on whether the puma issuitable for pregnant soldiersa more interesting problem remainsthe interior of the vehicle is suitablefor soldiersonly 1.84 meters tall and for crewmembers1.91 meters tall as you knowgermans are tall people in comparison tothe world averageaccording to a study conducted in 2018only 86 percent of the soldiers in thegerman mechanized infantry unitsare within the height limit that canserve in this vehiclethe same research also revealed that twopercent of the current vehicle personnelwouldn't be able to work in the pumaalready in 2013there was a list of defects with almost1000 positionswhich showed many problems in theprojectdue to the various change requestsduring developmentthere are still the lies in theproduction of full operational readinesseven for vehicles that have already beendeliveredtherefore the pumas are expected tobecome fully operationalonly in 2023 or 2025.the cost of all necessary retrofits isestimatedat up to 4 billion euros as a result ofberlin's effort to reduce defensespending for many yearsit is known that the german army has hadmajor problemsin spare parts recently this is aproblem for a new systemsuch as puma that has not been savedfrom infancyeven germany's decision to supply 350puma orderswith only 200 protection level c kitsshows that bigger problems may beexperienced in the futureas you know the modular structure whichis based on additional armor packagesoffers a great advantage as it allowsthe vehicledamaged and conflict environment toreturn to its dutyin a short time however given thecurrent ordersit can be seen that there will not beenough kits for a pumato be re-equipped with a second armorpackagethis eliminates the advantage of thevehiclethe problems experienced in the pumaprogram are not a big surprisefor current situation in the world theuncertaintybudget cuts and political complexitiesthat had started with the end of thefirst cold waralso affected the fate of this vehiclehowever it was important that germanywas embarkedon such an adventure at a time when asignificant part of the world waspursuing a strange idealike an unarmored armored vehiclethe time confirmed the germansmany important programs that have beenconducted in the last10 years are for developing vehiclesover 30 tonstoday when the second cold war is risingpuma has the potential to attract morecountriesif it reaches more customers the

go live on thesite just as soon as the pictures areworking and they got everything all thedescriptions for the shoes everything upand then that's when the goal I knowsince the other time he's like no musicbut well let me see if I can just placean order for you right now and I'm likeI got my hopes up I'm sixand I have my credit card out andeverything then he's like what's yourzip code and then I start gettingnervous because I look again and I waslike good so he's like so I start sayingand he's like oh it's just Canada andlike yes and he's like oh let me see ifI can get International on the phonegoes to an international part Departmentcomes back and he's like yeah I'm sosorry you can't do it and was like ohI'm never gonna get these shoes but he'slike but keep checking back just keeprefresh and keep refreshing all daybecause I'm not sure what time the shoesare gonna go out so I keep doing thatkeep doing that I'm probably around 3o'clock the shoes were off and I justlike frantically filled out the form and- just doing a credit card informationin there but the problem was because itwas in Canada they tacked in a 55 dollarduty charge and I'm like it balloonedthe price of the shoes up to two hundredand fifty five dollars I was like that'sthat's ridiculous but because I wantedthese shoes is so bad and I was so seton them I was just like I'm just likeacting like you know I just had themoney like that yeah so it came up to255 and I was like okay then I had anapp because I was exhausted from all ofthis so I ended up waking up for my labjust randomly hopped on Twitter and thenI saw that get outside shoes which is alocal shoe store here in Toronto um theyinitially were selling the shoes instore which I had no idea about but thenthey opened it up to online so I waslike let me just get a pair from thereand it's not gonna be this ridiculousprice so I ordered them off the getoutside site for the regular price of150 and I just put it for pickup so Icould just go downtown myself and pickit up and not have to pay shipping andthen I went back to Nordstrom I was likecancel that cancel thatyeah that's my Puma creeper story so itwas quite the roller coaster but I endedup getting the shoes let's get into thisunboxing video now because these shoes Ireally love and they're really cool okayso the shoes come in this a matte blackbox and it's just NT here at the topyou open up the box and you've got thislittle dust bag it's actually reallynice it's like a velvet kind of materialand that also says Fenty the coloringactually looks really great in person umso as I said there's the burgundy yeahso as I said there's the burgundy stripeand then it's hunter green it comes withtwo sets of laces is this this umregular set and then this is kind oflike a waxed kind of like a waxed Idon't even know what to call itput waxed laces right here there's thesekind of gold accents on the wax sort oflaces okay and then here on the tongueit says puma by rihanna as you can seethe sole it's rubber and it's thick tohave like that british punk rock creeperlook um they're actually reallycomfortable I got them in a seven and ahalf I normally wear seven and a halfbecause I wasn't sure if the shoes weregonna run big or anything like thatbecause sometimes I can wear seven butthe seven and a half was fine especiallyif I'm wearing socks which I plan ondoingyeah the seven and a half works yeah andthat's like basically everything in thebox it's not really too much to it yeahthese are they're really cool um maybeI'll do a styling video I'm like how towear them cuz there's a lot of differentways that you can wear them I went withthis color just because I thought thatum the black all black goes like Ialready have all black shoes and allwhite I just I don't know I just wasn'treally into them and these ones werejust really cool and unique to me andjust funky I feel like they kind of hadthat old-school Puma vibe that's why Ikind of opted for these ones you can seethe back they're actually prettylightweight so I'm actually I'll showyou guys how they look onso this is what the shoes look like onas I said before they are reallylightweight the one thing I will say isthat I would actually recommend going ahalf-size down in these shoes I know Isaid the seven and a half were fine forme earlier in the video but I do findthat they're a little bit loose so Iwish I would have went a half-size downI will probably end up having to getinsoles for these just to make them alittle bit more snug,26,UCEaTAQbuyJ_FWOOQ5OsbK5A,Shop Zappos,3,1,0,23,No Tags,PUMA PUMA x XO

so we're here in Houston at buffaloHeights on the second floor which is asplit slab application applying 6100detailing with Puma BCR it's a grocerystore with apartment living on top wegot pretty much 90% of the job we havesplit slab condition with about ahundred thousand square feet of hotapplied with XOR 230 which is ever above[Music]though initially we were playing ondetailing with our 6100 until we talkedto David a little bit about how we cantie in with our VCR which is our Pumasystem first we had a hands-on trainingshowing him how the hot system workscompared to the VCR once we came out andwe actually started doing a mock-up andsome training we've seen how fast itcures compared to my guys to being downputting in detailing stripping in and ifyou're trying to keep a job on trackespecially a hot apply job with rain andall the elements outside you know thisthing really gets this thing up gearedand fast paced to stay on the good sideof a GC[Music]we did some comparison today between our6100 hot detailing and our Puma BC areclashing details we're trying to showthe difference in time savings the hotour traditional 6100 has a five-stepmethod we do primer first coat of

the penis the newest glider by avianit's a high-performance King postedglider with most of the performance of atopless but a bit easier handling at 28kilos the PM is not only the lightestcar in its class but it's also lightenedsome of those in the class below withits semi-elliptical plan form andpolyhedral it's also probably the mostbeautiful let's go into the detail ofhow we do it one of the first thingseverybody comments on when they see thepuma is the king post now actually Ithink the king post is one of the lessinteresting things about the glider butlet's get that out of the way firstokay so there's two good reasons why wehave the king post right forwards theway we do so the first reason for thatit's do with the VG now the Puma is ahigh-performance glider so it needs tohave a large VG travel this means thatbetween VG loosed and VG tight theleading edges of the wings are comingforwards and moving back quite a longway now when we're on the ground like weare at the moment the wings have beensupported by the topside wise which issported on the king post the lower sidewires are still just a just a little bitslack now this is VG full tight now andyou can see the side wires are stilljust slightly slack at thatnow that's very important that's goodfor hands relating to keep the wires thewires looks like slack then now when Irelease the VGwhat you see happiness the leading edgesmove backwards now because of the shapeso if you if you see as the leave neji'smove back those wires come backwards andit allows them to go more slack so nowwe have more slack in our lower sidewires with VG loose than we did withthem tight now of course when you takeoff the wing becomes loaded and thelower side wires become tight the otherside wires will become loose that's nota problem in itself so having havingside wires were a little bit of slack inthem on the ground isn't too much of aproblem the problem comes when you havesidewise with loads of slack in them onthe ground it just makes a glider feel abit sort of nasty to stand with whenyou're on launch as I say having slackerlower side wires is one consequence ofhaving a lot of VG travel there's a fewthings you can do to deal with that withthat issue so some manufacturers addsort of some complicated systems maybesome movie extra moving parts in thekingpost maybe some extra moving partsaround the around the junction of thelower side was to try and get rid ofthat slack we don't know like addingthose moving parts adds extra weight itadds extra complexity it's more thingsto set up so a very simple way to reducethe amount that the wires become slackas you release the VG it's just bytilting the kingpost forwards so you cansee that the point around which thewires are moving is much closer to thepoint around which the leakages aremoving so that means there's lessdifference so the Puma is very nice inthat it has still relatively tightslight lower side wires even when you'reon the ground the other reason why wehave the King Pro straight forwards theway it is to do with performance so youcan see that as the King post tiltsforward you're seeing less of it ifyou're the heir and so there's lessfrontal area so there's less drag forthat reason the other reason is if youlook at these two aerofoil sections soon this side we have our speed fryupright section which is pretty muchideal from an aerodynamic point of viewhere we have a king post section now youcan see the king post section is ashorter section and that means that it'sso it's a slightly less efficientaerodynamic exception than a normalupright section now we can get aroundthat slightly that effect of it beingshorter by simply angling it so thateffectively the cross section that theair sees as it cuts the upright is alonger section and it's getting prettyclose to the to the ideal shape like ourspeed up right so one final thing aboutthe king post as well while we're on thesubject you can also see that the frontto rear wire also only attaches part wayup the king post rather than to the topof it that's purely for performance sowe've shortened the amount of wire whichis exposed to the air so reduce the dragby that amount it's still strong and youcan see from the from the geometry ofthe wires being in line directly in linewith the king post the king post isstill being loaded in compression andthose from wires are literally they'rejust they're they're very lightly loadedwires so there's no problem with havingno shorter the PM has actually been onthe low test rig up to 120 kilograms sothat's plus 6 g minus 3 J so plus 6times 120 minus 3 times 120 and that themine is free load test of course that'sloading the king post to the maximum sowe've we've tested the the Puma to ahigher load than its it's ever going toget in normal free flight use the reasonfor that it's because nowadayseverybody's interested in power unitsparticularly the Nano trikesso we're future-proof in a fewto be able to check that it's able totake the loads that are required forthose so actually one of the moreinteresting things about it is the shapeof the sail and the in the cut and theway the the leading edge is arranged soquite an unusual feature so this wastaken directly from the Evo is that thatyou can see that the leading edge has achange in direction and around thispoint just here so we've got a slightincrease in SOI bangle and we've alsogot an increase in dihedral at thispointthis gives the guide a really nicehandling while still letting this frogwith tight DJ that's a good performanceone of the things that sets the puma andalso the Evo apart from other lots ofother gliders it's the it's the shape ofthe of the platform of the wing so youcan see if you look along the trailingedge of the wing the wing actually thetaper

the penis the newest glider by avianit's a high-performance King postedglider with most of the performance of atopless but a bit easier handling at 28kilos the PM is not only the lightestcar in its class but it's also lightenedsome of those in the class below withits semi-elliptical plan form andpolyhedral it's also probably the mostbeautiful let's go into the detail ofhow we do it one of the first thingseverybody comments on when they see thepuma is the king post now actually Ithink the king post is one of the lessinteresting things about the glider butlet's get that out of the way firstokay so there's two good reasons why wehave the king post right forwards theway we do so the first reason for thatit's do with the VG now the Puma is ahigh-performance glider so it needs tohave a large VG travel this means thatbetween VG loosed and VG tight theleading edges of the wings are comingforwards and moving back quite a longway now when we're on the ground like weare at the moment the wings have beensupported by the topside wise which issported on the king post the lower sidewires are still just a just a little bitslack now this is VG full tight now andyou can see the side wires are stilljust slightly slack at thatnow that's very important that's goodfor hands relating to keep the wires thewires looks like slack then now when Irelease the VGwhat you see happiness the leading edgesmove backwards now because of the shapeso if you if you see as the leave neji'smove back those wires come backwards andit allows them to go more slack so nowwe have more slack in our lower sidewires with VG loose than we did withthem tight now of course when you takeoff the wing becomes loaded and thelower side wires become tight the otherside wires will become loose that's nota problem in itself so having havingside wires were a little bit of slack inthem on the ground isn't too much of aproblem the problem comes when you havesidewise with loads of slack in them onthe ground it just makes a glider feel abit sort of nasty to stand with whenyou're on launch as I say having slackerlower side wires is one consequence ofhaving a lot of VG travel there's a fewthings you can do to deal with that withthat issue so some manufacturers addsort of some complicated systems maybesome movie extra moving parts in thekingpost maybe some extra moving partsaround the around the junction of thelower side was to try and get rid ofthat slack we don't know like addingthose moving parts adds extra weight itadds extra complexity it's more thingsto set up so a very simple way to reducethe amount that the wires become slackas you release the VG it's just bytilting the kingpost forwards so you cansee that the point around which thewires are moving is much closer to thepoint around which the leakages aremoving so that means there's lessdifference so the Puma is very nice inthat it has still relatively tightslight lower side wires even when you'reon the ground the other reason why wehave the King Pro straight forwards theway it is to do with performance so youcan see that as the King post tiltsforward you're seeing less of it ifyou're the heir and so there's lessfrontal area so there's less drag forthat reason the other reason is if youlook at these two aerofoil sections soon this side we have our speed fryupright section which is pretty muchideal from an aerodynamic point of viewhere we have a king post section now youcan see the king post section is ashorter section and that means that it'sso it's a slightly less efficientaerodynamic exception than a normalupright section now we can get aroundthat slightly that effect of it beingshorter by simply angling it so thateffectively the cross section that theair sees as it cuts the upright is alonger section and it's getting prettyclose to the to the ideal shape like ourspeed up right so one final thing aboutthe king post as well while we're on thesubject you can also see that the frontto rear wire also only attaches part wayup the king post rather than to the topof it that's purely for performance sowe've shortened the amount of wire whichis exposed to the air so reduce the dragby that amount it's still strong and youcan see from the from the geometry ofthe wires being in line directly in linewith the king post the king post isstill being loaded in compression andthose from wires are literally they'rejust they're they're very lightly loadedwires so there's no problem with havingno shorter the PM has actually been onthe low test rig up to 120 kilograms sothat's plus 6 g minus 3 J so plus 6times 120 minus 3 times 120 and that themine is free load test of course that'sloading the king post to the maximum sowe've we've tested the the Puma to ahigher load than its it's ever going toget in normal free flight use the reasonfor that it's because nowadayseverybody's interested in power unitsparticularly the Nano trikesso we're future-proof in a fewto be able to check that it's able totake the loads that are required forthose so actually one of the moreinteresting things about it is the shapeof the sail and the in the cut and theway the the leading edge is arranged soquite an unusual feature so this wastaken directly from the Evo is that thatyou can see that the leading edge has achange in direction and around thispoint just here so we've got a slightincrease in SOI bangle and we've alsogot an increase in dihedral at thispointthis gives the guide a really nicehandling while still letting this frogwith tight DJ that's a good performanceone of the things that sets the puma andalso the Evo apart from other lots ofother gliders it's the it's the shape ofthe of the platform of the wing so youcan see if you look along the trailingedge of the wing the wing actually thetaper pattern of the wing changes as itgoes along this creates a moreelliptical planformof the wing and so a more ellipticaldistribution of lift over the wing whichis optimal for reducing induced drag Ihope

positionhe's so clever with the ball incrediblequalityand he's a funny guy and he's anincredible heartsays her fabric as i stay a short timewith her in barcelona and maybe it's thebest quarterback i everi ever seen in my career as a footballplayer manager he has an incrediblevision when he has the ball to lookforwardevery pass he did would took senseand always with idea to to to score agoali think is a guy he has the ability itdoesn't matter with 10 meters 20 40meters to put the ballin front of the of the keeper hugetalent really really huge talentfernandinho another other captainshave been since the day one until nowand i would say it's uhhe's an incredible person and and uhnow he's a 36 37 years old so it's atthe end of his careerand i still now have the desire thepassion and right now isour captain and and he is a guy who cantrust him on the pitch and of the pitch100is another guy who helps me a lot tosettle good in the beginningand help me to have the success that wehad in this club in the lastyears seducer one ofmy favorite ones maybe is one of themost generous and nicest persons i evermet in the world footballi would love to have him right now evenhalf 40 years old for exampleand never complain is a typical guy likehe plays or doesn't playhe's always be with you all the time heplays five minutes he's going to playthe best five minutes he plays 90minutes 90 minutesand always is a guy who thinks the bestfor the team david silvalast year was our captain he's a guywho's another incredible legend here inthis cluband he's a guy like uh playing smallpocketsin uh in a different smaller spaces thatwe needis a genius and what surprised me themost when i met himthe incredible competitor and physicalstrong player he isso it was incredible these yearstogether it was adisease of part of our success the arenai love this guywhen arriving barcelona he struggled thefirst year there afterb incredible legend arsenal sometimes ireviewed eclipsehe was the best player in the leaguemany years in this leaguehe helped with uh with arsenal team toachieveincredible achievements andespecially our first year it wasincredibly important for the year we wonthe six titles in a row tt was soimportanthis movement runs in behind and thementality to beto be a competitor and especiallyan important game to be decisive soalways a pleasure when iwere to to speak with him now i knowhe's in an mls andhopefully he can he can make a gooda good season okay the last two two arestrikersuh sergio the first one so i thinkis the guy being a hugehuge huge star uh is the more humbleperson uh normally the big bigger starsthey are a little bit you knowlike carogan or present to us or competein the good termsbecause sometimes to be a superstar youhave to bea little bit arrogant his guy hislove you know who he does and uhand what can i say he scored the mostthe most important goal in this club andi thinkhe produced the he was joy mom and joyofuh manchester family for the rest of ourlifeand the last one samuel this is not thebestit's close the best striker i ever iever seenhe could do absolutely everything andhe's a typical player in the importantgames always was thereall the time was that that year with thesix titles in a row the same year likettuh he was an incredible part anincredible part of thisand he's humble enough humble enough intermsokay someone maybe is not the humblestperson i ever metbut humble enough when you had playingwinger right winger he accept for thebest of the teami think it's a really really good teamso we could win a lot of games with thiswith this squad,2,UCXaco2ju36IqZUdRJuauirA,Jan von Behren,73,39,0,1425,"['Case', 'Case puma', '225', 'Sound', 'Puma', 'Puma 225', 'CIH', 'International Harvester', 'Landtechnik', 'FPT',

eightproducts but the beauty of it is is thatit's Puma branded it's got a Puma flairto it some unique elements that add thePuma style to it so we look at it it'sfull grain cowhide with a mixture of s1stretch panels on the inside of the armsdown the front abdomen and then on theinside and backs of the legs and whatthose s1 stretch panels to is they allowfor comfort flexibility as well asairflow within the suit you're gonna seethe full grain leather completes thepicture here and in the shoulders you'regonna see a really a staple of theDainese line these Co injected shoulderarmor plates that are in the inside aregoing to BCE rated armor that's going toconform to your body and feel softcomfortable keeping while keeping youprotected but on the outside you havethis aluminum slider that has that'sanodized black that's that has a mattefinish to it and that gives youadditional the additional protection ofthe slide element moving down the fronthere you see a it's a puma zipper coverthe suits going to have a removable meshliner that is washable you knoweverything's gonna be safety stitched itcomplies the same level of quality thatyou're gonna see from Dainese and againit's co branded so it's Puma meets DianaZ moving down to the knees hereadditional elasticated panels across thetop of the knees you're gonna have Ceerated armor inin these that goes all theway down the shin with a puma brandedknee puck here again produced by DNA'sthey turn and face that way for meFreddyface to the side moving back up to theelbow elasticated panels at the back ofthe elbow Cee rated armor it's theDainese race armor at the elbow as wellas the forearm if we lift the arm hereagain elasticated panels on these bandsthat come all the way down and cutacross the lower back if Freddie hitthat they the light race position for meyou see these stretch areas it's reallybuilt for comfort on the bike the coolpart about the suit you can stand alittle bit back up for me Freddy is thatyou're gonna have the puma accents herenot only the Puma cat logo but also thePuma accents that add a nice stylistictouch turn to face backwards for meFreddy now if we look at the top hereyou're gonna have an s-1 stretch panelalong the top of the neck you have yourGP style sport hump or speed hump thatgoes all the way down for airflow andaerodynamics Puma logo Puma logo acrossthe lower back here and as we get

durable and then you havethe double zipper system that we see onDianna is a one zipper is four in andout the other zipper is foradjustability so if you're wearing aboot under you can loosen that up so youget a like something like a Dianna is atorque Pro in or an axial race in wouldgo underneath this suit as well face meoff ready you notice the Puma logo thatgoes up the side of the leg here and

eightproducts but the beauty of it is is thatit's Puma branded it's got a Puma flairto it some unique elements that add thePuma style to it so we look at it it'sfull grain cowhide with a mixture of s1stretch panels on the inside of the armsdown the front abdomen and then on theinside and backs of the legs and whatthose s1 stretch panels to is they allowfor comfort flexibility as well asairflow

are in the inside aregoing to BCE rated armor that's going toconform to your body and feel softcomfortable keeping while keeping youprotected but on the outside you havethis aluminum slider that has that'sanodized black that's that has a mattefinish to it and that gives youadditional the additional protection ofthe slide element moving down the fronthere you see a it's a puma zipper coverthe

the light race position for meyou see these stretch areas it's reallybuilt for comfort on the bike the coolpart about the suit you can stand alittle bit back up for me Freddy is thatyou're gonna have the puma accents herenot only the Puma cat logo but also thePuma accents that add a nice stylistictouch turn to face backwards for meFreddy now if we look at the top hereyou're gonna have an s-1 stretch panelalong the top of the neck you have yourGP style sport hump or speed hump thatgoes all the way down for airflow andaerodynamics Puma logo Puma logo acrossthe lower back here and as we get

[Music]hey guys my name is Noah and today Iwill be reviewing a very unique pair ofshoes from Puma which is madespecifically for gamers roughly a weekago I came across the article that wasdescribing the shoes and that they weremade for eSports they have been madewith players in mind and it got verycurious and when I saw the picture Irealized that boy they look really goodfor dance games but you can't reallytell unless you try them and unless youfigure out how they're built or whattheir grip is so I immediately ordered apair and it finally arrived before Ibegin the question you must be allwondering obvious you double for dumbschemes yes they are but please stickaround because I will explain what downsize these shoes have because youdefinitely need to know a bit more aboutthem more about them before making thepurchase now let's talk about these boysso the first thing that I noticed iswhat's that they're extremely flexibleyou can see this spent going through themiddle there is no soul in this bit soyou can bend them almost in half veryeasily they are very light they lookvery comfy and the design is a bitbetter than the regular Mizuno designwhich I was very happy about so they arevery flexible which is very importantfor your triples and breck heads theyshoes consists of two parts so there'sthis shoe itself which reminds on mysock a little bit and there there's aninsole inside of the shoe which is quiteflexible by itself but it's a bit stiffif you touch it it's very light but it'snot as faint as you would expect it tobe this is the rough part of the shoebecause if you take it out this shoebecomes very very wobbly it can do thisbecause it's still bends in the middleand I try playing inwithout the insult it didn't work at allso guys why did he get up what he tookthe shoes out of the box I wasspeechless when I put them on becausethe grip is just insaneimagine these shoes having claws andjust get it into your wooden floor itand just stay in there and not lettinggo that's how they feel this rubber isit's just it feels like I will put it onthe glass and it was just stay there andit's awful right you can't play in thembut I got a curious I didn't want tosend them back immediately so I went tomy friend's house and she had thislovely 9 panel platform with acrylicbuttons on them and I applied somepowder on them sorry shoes you're gonnago back but I cleaned them off it's allnice and clean and I plated those and hegot so much better with powder and ifthey did eat a lot of powder because allthe pores started absorbing it it tooksome time to figure out the right amountof powder but just with any other shoesmost of the shoes I'd say the powderwere yourself so you need to top up abitbaby powder will polish due to rentwhatever you use you will becomedependent on it if you didn't bring babypowder with these shoes to the Archy youwon't be able to play this is going tobe a waste of your time so that's to mepersonally it's a big commitment becausenow I need to carry more items around mebecause when I play my Mizuno's theydon't really need that much baby powderwhen it was playing I 2g I've realisedthat I quite like the shoes I could playI didn't in them but it should keep inmind that I did use the game that ismostly played in stocks at least inEurope and most of the people keepplaying in socks because this shoes feelnothing like socksthis this is not a sock this is aglorified slipper but it's also ashipmentif you're wondering whether these couldreplace you your I to do stocks theywant and they hunt but if you're lookingfor a nice replacement for your Nikesthese might actually work so if you areplaying FA in itg this might be prettygood for younow after I finished playing IgG I wentstrenght to the arcade because I neededto make sure I try the shoes with thosemetal panels and what if they're allamount of powder it was pretty good Ilike them I like them in a lot a lot I'mnot gonna lie they're very comfy theyfeel better than my Nikes I still lovemy Manzano's and I like them more butbecause Mizuno's are not being producedanymore and these just came out to shopsin the long run I might swap to theseshoes the biggest problem with themespecially the sizing because I am size4 and I order all of my shoes in size 4sometimes they're a bit smallersometimes they're a bit bigger but thesepair was extremely big it felt like 5they have a bit of bounce to thembecause Mizuno's have absolutely nobones and these boys they bounce Minhand it feels great oh they're not asthick as Nike Nike run free free run owhatever version everyone's playing inright now they're not as thick they'rethinner so you can feel the platformbetter and I had no problems withstreaming and triples were so easy theywere don't you they were greatespecially because of this bend thistiny gap in the middle really helps youto bend the whole shoe so that makes adifference so don't worry about yourtroubles don't worry about your quadsit's all gonna be a nice and fine theyonly come in one color that's adisappointment but at least this blackcolor so it's gonna suitelse and as for the fabric it doesn'tfeel great but it doesn't really matterthat much does it because if we use themto play pomp not to touch them if youare thinking of purchasing these shoes Iwould definitely recommend you tryingthem out I think we should give them aproper chance they were not designed fordance gamers that's for sure oh no Ithink the shoes are well rounded and aresuitable for playing dance games as longas you supplement them with baby powderor anything that reduces the grip that'sgonna be it for today guys thank you somuch for sticking around I was veryexcited to make this review because Icould not sleep knowing that out theremight be

hi good afternoon that's the the timeover here time of the day here on theEast Coast I just wanted to briefly aspossible ten minutes or less I'll talkabout the Rihanna creepers by Puma Ithink a lot of people are definitelystill very interested in them and thenewer colorways came out sometime inNovember and I have two of them I'mgetting rid of one of them because oneof the sizes was the size was too smallI was being thirsty and I want him sobad I bought it anyway I was lucky toget my bed my size about like threeweeks later but I just wanted to talkabout kind of I guess the reality ofwearing creepers if you have it I feellike a lot of people that want theRihanna sneakers they want it come itbecause it's Rihanna and that's andthat's okayI bought them to kind of because of thatI've never really been a creeper justkind of girl and not because I thinkbadly of them it's just like and Ialways feel like it was like a block onyour foot and they would be kind of hardto walk and like I know people done itfor yearsyou know when creepers were made in thetraditional sort of more traditionalpurpose and then later on towards a morekind of a subculture fashion statementbut it's never really I was alwaysworried about that like and I've seencute wants to wear I considered gettingthem but I just never never did butthese are the first time I got and I'mwearing creepers now anime meyou know I creates to get in creepers soI'm gonna show them both off and justtalk about what it's like to wear themthe first pair I got which I am gonnaget rid of they're not my size are theseblack with the white Puma suedewhatnot and white and um yeah and I sawhim in person I was like oh they'reactually really really cute and I Ithink for such a simple detail as wereadding a platform to the classic Pumaswave was really smart and cool like allthey deal with this league has made thisfar bigger but it adds so much andoh yeah it's an Italian person I reallylike them and I asked for a size 10 theydidn't have it they had a nine so Ibusiness week one and I get had him onand they did fit but you know once Iactually wore them like for a day myfeet did work more in pain like kind ofan unbearable yeah I'm unbearableexplain I want to take scruciating butit was pretty it was pretty bad it alsohappens when you're thirsty so don't belike me and be thirsty if you arelooking for the keepers and they're notin your sizejust wait or keep looking you knowespecially without used to wear towearing cream first because I did alsouse this thingy that's fun that's whatsaying thingie it has a name but it'sawful it is the shoes and it was reallyhelpful actually because I didn'tnecessarily need for it to be wider Ineed it for it to be longer this is thebroken one the other one is not it's notbroken but it right it did help um itdid how I felt the difference I think itwas on my right foot yeah so that wasvery very helpful but food for me Ineeded a size 10 I'm a size 10 and anyshoe high heel flat sneakers I'm a size10 very rarely do you see me wear a nineand a half or and an 11 sometimes tieand a half but that's when it's like aEuropean brand they just you just cutthe so cut but yeah but I did I didlike that my first said I got these atBodega a sneaker store in Boston and Ididn't know they were selling themselvesactually was it was a lot of things whyI was thirstyRihanna Puma I like the style but they Ihad them there was no size 10 it was asize 9 I bought it on the spot but thereI needed a size 10 but these I am gonnaresell and I was fortunate enough thatwhile I was in Soho in New York in theSoho neighborhoodaye-aye-aye someone made a mistake ofgoing into kids but at the same time Iwant to see what they had and they didhave the creepers as well and they hadmy my size there's always a fighta lot of a lot of stuff it's a verypopular spot for street wear andsneakers so cuz I said size 10 the guyjust went like straight to the bag therewas no hesitation this is one of thenewer color ways in which the platformand odor bites kind of blocking you fromseeing it correctly but it's a lightblue I got super cute I liked it Iwanted I loved dad tried it on and itwas a good solid fit so I got them nowwhat's it like wearing them which wassomeone like me who isn't a creeperwhere they are comfortable but Iwouldn't wear them back to back that Idid that recently while I was in NewYork and my feet even in my size whichis a size 10 they were hurting like I Idon't know about necessarily was limpingbut that's was walking very slowly Iwore them definitely for like eighthours I don't know for some you that areregular people wears might be like wellyou don't wear creepers or eight hoursor whatnot or if you're gonna be walkinga lot but I also wanted to just you knowfeel them out because you know they'rebrand new wear them this winter has beenvery odd and that the weather has beenwarmer than usualthey're definitely wanted in thepassword they'll be snow on the groundand all that I wouldn't even think ofwarranties or $120 no so I wanted totake advantage of the nice weather butyeah like these they are comfortable butthey will hurt after a few hours aroundmy definitely the ankle was in pain bythe end of the day like what time I goton my bus to head back home I was justlike my feet weren't burning the way waswith the size 9 naturally because theseare not my size but they definitely wereready to rest even in my size which is asize 10 so I'll take the reality of thecreepers so she don't wear them oftenit's just that they are heavy on yourfeetthey are heavy they're quite flat likeyou know how people use go in onconverse this means super flat wellthese I think are even flatter cuz I'vealways described creepers of being asbeing like a block on your foot likethere's no kind of it's only a slightit's so subtle that's almost I justwanted been there like curvature as faras the shape of your foot the averageshape of a foot you know with the theball of the foot and the heel andwhatnot so that's just the reality ofthat your feet may hurt a bitso don't you're gonna do a lot of walkin if you do want to wear them I get itthey cost money they're there in rightnow you know they're fashionable youknow you were used when your hard earnedmoney on them you want to wear them youknow I say go for itbut maybe pack a pair of flats or justan alternative pair of shoes because I'mtelling you by the time it was the endof the day and I was readyhot a day my my feet were hurting andyou don't be can't running these likeyou know trying to speed walk was looklike a like a dog like a waddle waddleand duck like little duckling okay theylook cute doing that so that's kind ofthe reality of it definitely I want todissuade anybody from getting thembecause they are really really nice likeI do love them I really doit's just yeah give me a heads up yourfeet will hurt a little bit but ifyou're used to wearing creepers maybethey won't there are people that wearthem everyday you know so it could be acase of just getting used to it as wellbut I love that I'm happy I got itRihanna got me my first pair notliterally but I'm got me to wear myfirst pair of creepers so here's the boxwhen you do get them it's simple butit's nice by Rihanna Fenty is her lastname and I have to say about it tipsreally yeah get your size it'll bethirsty like me and not get it cuz therealready are a very unique this thingkind of sneaker and shoe so you don'tneed to add any more pain and you mayalready havein your normal size so get your size getthe color way that you do want or thatyou're okay with and yeah justdefinitely have fun with them you couldjust them up or down and if you haveenough room in your bag and it's gonnabe a while to get back home packalternative shoes to

hi Jacob unisport webtv and today I'mbringing you the first review in 2014 ofthis guy the puma evopower now thisbrand new silo kind of breaks with theconventional thinking when it comes topower in a football game because it isbuilt to enhance the natural kickingmotion of your bare foot but how doesthe able power deliver as a footballboot and does it give you more powerwhen you strike the ball well I thinkit's time that we find out so join menow first of all the evil power is madeto maximize the power of your naturalstrike and through a lot and lot ofresearchPuma found out that you actually get themost power in your stride when your footis allowed to pin naturally and theyalso found out that conventionalfootball boots won't allow your foot todo that simply because the upper and thesole plates are too stiff and restrictedto allow your foot to move naturally andthis is what they want to change withthe able power and one of the majorchanges comes to the upper and on theevopower they are introducing this uppermaterial which is a Japanese syntheticcalled a de blight which is really thinsoft and actually pretty stretchy atleast it stretches lengthwise stretchesquite a lot actually but it doesn'tstretch that much sideways and this isbasically to allow the boot to followthe shape of your foot as you bend itwhen you strike the ball and as Imentioned this upper material isridiculously soft it really wraps yourfoot nicely to give you a personal snugand comfortable fit without overstretching and getting to lose which youmight feel and this might sound a bitdeaf but I actually think that you haveto feel the material in your hands or onyour feet to understand how awesome itactually is it just feels rightnow speaking of the comfort and the fitin able power it does give you aninteresting combination of a really widelag and I'm talking really really quietlast it is one of the widest boots I'veever played in and I have to say thatit's perhaps a bit too roomy for myliking because in this area on theinstep there is a bit too much facebetween the upper and my foot now one ofthe other things preventing your footfrom moving naturally when you'restriking the ball with a football booton is the soleplate and thus Pumaintroduced their GSF system theirgradual stability frame system with areally dense and stiff torsion barlocated under the mid foot thatgradually gets more and more flexiblewhen we move towards the forefoot andthus the forefoot is really flexible andit actually flexes both ways in order toallow the boot to actually move with thenatural movement of the foot and givingus less restrictions and actually whenyou combine the torsion bar with the GSFsystem it gives you a really nice secureand stable base for your movements andif we look at the forefoot it reallyfeels natural bending your footno matter the direction and it actuallymade me feel more free when I wore theable power which is a great feeling whenyou're taking on your direct opponentnow when it comes to the touch on theball the evil part is pretty interestingbecause on one hand we have the superthin out of light material that sitscloser to your foot to give you a reallyprecise touch on the ball and then onthe other hand we have the actual phoneputts that are made to give you a largercleaner striking surface but they arealso slightly thicker which will giveyou a slightly more padded touch on theball and this gives you a prettyinteresting combination with bothprecision and the more padded feelingand it's a nice mixture between the twoso when it comes to shooting the Accufoam actually delivers a clean adaptivestriking surface but let's be honest youdon't become mark Royce all of a suddenjust by putting on a pair of evil powerseven though it is great but still theAccu foam actually feels a bit moreforgiving simply because you have aslightly larger surface to hit the ballwith but it's still mostly up to youeven though the boot is really good butlet's get down to it the big question doyou get a more powerful strike in thepuma evopower and i have to becompletely honest with you here Ihaven't been able to feel that much of achange what I have been able to feelthough is that when you strike the ballwith a lot of power I feel a lot less ofthe sting you get in the Puma a youapart and basically it feels like thefoot is indeed moving just a little bitto ease some of the pressure itself andstriking the ball with a lot of venomactually feels better in the pumaevopower than in most other piece outthere which is honestly not what Iexpected initially but what do you knowbut a definite increase in my strikingpower I haven't been able to feel it tobe honestso did Puma solve the job they set outto do with the able power and yeah I'dsay that they actually did and eventhough I didn't feel an increase in mystriking power it still feels prettygood putting your foot through the ballin the evopower the comfort is prettygood the upper is sensationally soft andstretchy and have to prove been just atad bit slimmer I wouldn't hesitatecalling this the best home movie evermade it probably still is though anddefinitely worth a tryespecially if you have quite feet butthese were my thoughts on the brand-newable power from Puma what do you thinkabout the new boot and is it somethingfor you well please leave a comment inthe box below don't

hi Jacob unisport webtv here today toreview something navy white and purpleit's the evopower 1.2 of course whichstill continues the evopower concept ofdelivering power and accuracy to yourgame but the nuevo power 1.2 lines withup bucketload of changes so the questionis will the able power one point todeliver well stay right here with me andfind outnow now most of the changes or actuallyall of them on the evopower 1.2 are madeto the upper well Puma have introduced anew generation of the synthetic a deblack material that's quite a bitthinner than the one on the evopower onebut it still has this stretch ability toallow your foot to bend naturally whichin the end should give you more powerwhen you shoot and you definitely feelthe changes when you get your feet inthe evopower 1.2 it still really reallysoft it's less padded and airy than thelast generation and therefore it mightfeel a bit more rigid at first but onceit's on it's incredibly soft around yourfeet and because the adeb light is sosoft the fit in the evopower 1.2 isamazing there ok I said it is reallyreally good even straight out of the boxsimply because the adeb light reallywraps your foot spa closely but withoutbeing overly tight and I had no pressurepoints on the upper whatsoeveragain even straight out of the box nowone of the main reasons behind this fitbeing so adaptive is the Accu foamtechnology and actually it representsthe biggest change on the evil power inmy opinion because who might have takenthe Accu foam parts from the evil powerone on the instep and scrapped them andturn the Accu foam into an inner liningwhere it really sits like this honeycomblike mesh to really wrap your foot ineven out all the little bumps and unevensurfaces you have on your foot aroundyour toes and not only is it reallybeneficial for your accuracy but it alsoreally aids the upper in wrapping yourfoot very precisely following every leadshape there might be it was absolutelybrilliant now another new feature on theevopower 1.2 are these kind of skeletonlike protrusions on the outside of theboot and here they've actually just madethe upper ever so slightly thickersimply to give you a bit more supportand stability to keep your foot on theplate when you make sharp cuts or hotmovements and it actually works prettywell because you really feel that thefoot gets the support it needs to avoidit sliding around when you changedirection now another change has beenmade on the hill where Puma have made ita bit higher compared to the evopowerone but it's also still really soft andcollapsible like the evil power onesingle to allow your foot to flex whenyou bend it on the other hand thissoftness also means that I'm missing abit of lockdown to keep my heel securelyfastened in the heel cup it's not a lotbut again it is a trade-off with thesoftness and the flexibility talkingabout the last it is the very same evilapp to last that we saw on the evopowerone similar because Puma got a lot ofgreat feedback on the last so theythought hey why change it so theyhaven't but that also means that we getthis anatomical toe box and of coursethe super super wide fit and whilethat's good for a lot of people with myrelatively slim feet I do have someextra space under the mid foot andadmittedly it's not a big problem for mebut in order to get the tightest fitpossible which I like I could have donewith a slightly slimmer last but it alsoleads me over to the sizing where I'mpretty much true to size I'm normally aUK size 6 and that's also the case inthe evopower 1.2 where the length isabsolutely perfect you can go up half asize if you want or you have humongouslywide feet but both coulter and i aretrue to size in this back pocket now oneminor complaint I have about theevopower 1.2 though is the tongue don'tget me wrong it's super nice and paddedand avoids giving me lace bite and allthat stuff but it tends to move quite alot when I play and while it's notspoiling the fun of the evil part for meit is still a bit of an annoying factorhave to constantly reposition the tonguewhen you are playing when we look at theoutsole and the stuck configurationthere is nothing new Under the Sunbecause again why change a winning teamnow that also means that again we havethis relatively flexible P Beck'soutsole under the forefoot with thegradual stability frame under the midfoot and actually the soleplate workspretty well because you get thiscombination of stability under the midfoot and flexibility under the full footto really make your foot feel free likeyou can move in any direction now thestar configuration itself also workspretty well it does its job without toomuch fuss especially because these fourconical studs under the forefoot allowsyou to move rather smoothly through theground without being too clinging andalso we have these blades that allowsyou to get some stability while alsogiving you a bit more aggressive gripwhen you cut now the biggest complimentI can give to the stock configuration isthe fact that I actually haven't reallynoticed it while I've been playingbecause I got no stop pressure it wasn'treally sticking too much to the groundand it just did its job now when itcomes to the touch and a ball things getinteresting because the evopower 1.2feels really really precise on the ballsimply because you have this thin out ofline up and it's it's relatively closeto your foot also there is this ever soslightly padded rather elegant feel toit so it is also a little bit soft onthe ball while being incredibly precisenow the most significant change on theevopower 1.2 is the addition of ribtanks as well as this rather mat afinish on the out of light and youdefinitely feel that there is a lot morefriction between the boot and the ballthen in the evil power one now eventhough you do get some grip from thegrip takes while tripling don't expecttoo much it comes to putting swirl onthe ball because I really haven't feltanything in that department but ingeneral when it comes to striking theball the evil power is really reallygood and actually one of my favoriteLucianthe market simply because you get areally solid connection with the pole inthis plane striking surface with arelatively low tool box that allows youto get under the ball no questions askedand it really just feels good to strikethe ball whether you're shooting orpassing and if you have teammates thatthink you shoot too much yourself don'tbuy the evil part because you're gonnawant a shoe so all in all the pumaevopower is a really really great bootand it's a big improvement over the evilpower one simply because it's muchbetter on the ball it's more comfortableit's more stable in the active forminterlining as opposed to shooting andthe fit and is a great great improvementmore of that pleasepuma but what do you guys actually thinkabout the new evil power 1.2 and this issomething for you you should let me knowin the comment section below becausethis is all i have for you for today butwe're back again later with more newsbut when to me signing offcheerio now summing up the comfort andthe fit this has to be one of the mostcomfortable boots on the market rightnow even despite the fact that it onlyweighs 205 wraps because Puma reallynailed the fit it's very comfortable andthe upper is so supersoft and eventhough the evopower one was alreadyincredibly comfortable this is just animprovement because the upper feels abit more premium less for me andplasticky and just a bit more stablearound your foot in other words it'sreally really good if only Puma made aslim

youhey this is Anthony with RevZilla TV andwelcome to our detailed breakdown of thePuma race leather suit available in 2011now if we look at this the first thingyou're going to notice is that it's Pumabranding throughout it has that greatPuma style this is a suit that is veryunique in a way that it's put togetherin the way that it's cut the beauty ofit is that Puma has teamed up with DianeAZ to give you all of the high-endfeatures functionality construction andreally even that Diane is a style Flairis married here with the Puma suit sowhat you're gonna notice it's a fullgrain leather exterior safety stitchedYKK zippers very high-end quality thatyou'd expect from Diane AZ and then whatyou're going to have is some othersubtle elements from Puma that maketheir way in so starting up here at thezipper cover so you have the Puma logohere you're gonna notice here down atthe bottom of the sleeves you're gonnahave the Puma swoosh to our logo thatthat's that you're used to seeing on onPuma branded apparel now if we get intothe main construction you have fullgrain leather across the impact areasyou can have s1 stretch panels they comedown on the inside of the arms at theabdomen along the inside of the legs andon the backs of legs what that allowsfor is some room for expansion comfortand breathability these will flow airand they'll also depending if you're athin build you're an athletic build orif you're a muscular build it could giveyou some stretch here moving down herealong the front move down towards thelegs you can see elasticated stretchpanels across the front of the legs Iwill note that it's dimpled leather it'snot perforated there's no perversion asa suit and the really cool thing aboutthis it stands out for me is you'restarting to see the inside of the kneesliders from Dainese all race suits havea slider they have a replaceable kneepuck these actually have Co injectedtitanium and carbon fiber knee slidersthat also have polished titanium whichyou only really see on Valentino Rossisuit and you have these on the tops ofthe knees really from Dainese you'reonly seeing this type of functionalityin the mission suitnotice also c c/e rated knee armor belowthat as well as shin armor that goes allthe way down turn to face that way forme Chris as we do a side profile againCo injected shoulders which you see alot from Diane AZ but the beauty here isthat you have a titanium slider within acarbon fiber seat that's built into theco injected piece here on the undersideof that inside is going to be removableGP style Cee rated Armour from Diane AZbut externally you have that really neatcarbon fiber style with the titaniumupgraded sliders moving down the side ofthe arm soft inserts here for additionalprotection and comfort elasticatedpanels across the back of the elbow morecarbon fiber seated titanium slidersthat go that have also are backed by CTrated GP style Dionysia proprietaryarmor that's in the elbow that goes thefull length of the cuff if we look atthe cuffs here it's a single YKK zipperwith a Velcro snap obviously meant for afull gauntlet to be worn over top if welook at the elastication panels you cansee Chris isn't even in the raceposition now but you can see it'sstarting to pull see elasticated panelacross the shoulder blade comes downalong the underneath underside of thearm and goes across completely acrossthe lower back Chris hit the raceposition for me lightly there put yourarms forward you can see how that beginsthe stretch in those key areas go aheadand stand up for me now face the backwall GP style speed hump here with thebig puma logo as well as the swooshes oneither side s1 stretch panel across theback of the neck which is going to giveyou breathability airflow and comfortand again two reasons to have a speedhump on a suit one for aerodynamics asit creates a clean line from your helmetthe second is to aid you in a slidesituation if you have a get off on thetrack as we move down the back of thesuit here you're going to see doublereinforced areas along the seat alongyour coccyx or your tailbone with softinserts moving past this largeelasticated panel area and then as weget back down here into the backs of thelegs more s1 stretch panels for comfortstretch and durability and then we alsohave a double zipper system we have azipper across the back of the calf and azipper across the inside of the leg oneis to adjust the size for different guyswith different calf diameters the otherone is to make it easy to get in and outof the pants Chris is also wearing apair of matching Puma boots there aswell turn back around for mealso note temper foam hip armor in thisguy as well the inside is going to be afully removable washable mesh liner thatzips out just like you'd see in Dianna'sa it's going to come with the dianese asome other Dinah's a accoutrement thatare going to be included with this guyreally it's a lot of bang for the buckthe price point in this guy is veryreasonable for the amount of suit you'regetting it's it's really going to standtoe-to-toe with something like thedionysia mission or some other Dainesesuits and again it offers the myone of the big standout features is thetitanium shoulder mounts with the carbonfiber seating in the co injectedshoulder external armor here which yousee shoulder elbow as well as the topinside of the knee which is really a GPstyle function that you only see in thesuper super high-end and to me that'sthat's really just a ton of bang for thebuck for the price point of this suitfor colors this is the all-black thiswill be no doubt the most popular colorthere's also a white which was reallylike a cream there's a red and there'salso a really really cool burnt olivewhich has art orange accents which youonly see from Puma frame of referenceChris is six foot three and a half he is195 pounds he's about a forty three inchchest Chris is wearing a size 54 suit 56would be too big when this guy breaks init would fit him perfect with a backprotector on him we've had him on thebike on this for a frame of referencethis would be a size I'm a fifty two inthis so I'm I'm a lot shorter than Chrisat five nine and a half but I'm a

hey this Anthea throws let's see whatyou can watch decide and ride welcome toour detailed breakdown of the new puma500 boots available at revzilla.com thisis the new puma 500 we're placing thedesmo and it comes in two flavors theone I have in my hand is the GTX versioncoming in over that three hundred dollarmark and some I left you can see theregular version non GTX the GTX isgore-tex so again if you're reallylooking at it you can look at it threeto four season full range waterproofboot if you want to go that directionand the way it's designed and styled tome really scream sport and sport touringnow remember you're investing ingore-tex waterproof breathableguaranteed for life it's going to keepMother Nature out if you go thisdirection but also allow your foot tobreathe and allow the sweat to perspirefrom your foot move through the membranekeeping you comfortable while keepingyou dry now if you get the non GTXversion than normal 500 I will tell youthat in a rainstorm you're gonna get wetbut at the end of the day it's still atwo to three to four season boot for amyriad of climates and a lot ofdifferent riding Styles notice it isfull height it's going to be syntheticleather throughout and it carries agreat deal of style and protection fromPuma now when I call it the replacementfor the desmo that is because it is avery very similar boot 90% of the samefunctionality 90% of the same design butthe one key change that they made whenthey went to the 500 vs. the desmo onboth the GTX and non GTX models isreally the entry and exit point it's nowa rear entry and exit you can see I havemy gore-tex version see how high thatGator comes up all the way to the top myregular version is exactly the same andon the previous model you entered andexited through the medial side so on theinside this would be a zipper that wouldgo all the way down you can see thatgore-tex stops that gator on the insideas well I will say we should dive intofit here and the fit is going to be keyand you need to listen upbecause these run differently sizedremember we're gonna ship for free overthirty nine bucks but you got to get itclose to being right use this size chartand whatever your size comes back at goa full size down your Puma 500 fits onefull size large you're gonna feel it inthefoot bed and I will tell you that nowthey've gone to a rear entry and exitthere's actually a lot of extra roomhere as well so one of my grapes mightbe that there's a little bit of extraroom around the ankle and then if welook at the top of this boot it isabsolutely massive and there's a lot ofadjustability around the calf so if youhave huge ankles if you have huge calf'sthis is actually a phenomenal option butit does run large and even if you'rebuying the right size you're still gonnahave a little bit of room to move we'llcall it that but remember you use a sizestart go back a full size or go down afull size it's gonna have a lot of roomfor expanse on the calf but the keything that homed in on is use a sizechart and go a full size down it fitsone size large remember as I said we'regonna ship for free over 13 bucks and asI always click our logo subscribe to usat RevZilla TV I love to hear commentsyour questions and your feedback on thenew Poobah 500 and 500 GTX now divinginto some of the nuance of the boot youalready heard me talk about the factthat synthetic leather throughout andyou can see here I have my 500 GTX in myhand this is the only color availableit's black it has orange accents and theorange and it's going to have a titaniumor reflective Puma stripe along theoutside so again you're getting a littlebit of extra functionality if you gowith the regular 500 it actually doesn'thave the orange and the black and thePuma stripe is just gonna be blacked outyou look at some of the other featureshere notice it does have a zinc back toeslider and actually comes with twotoasts sliders this is the short versionthere's also a longer version it isreplaceable it has zinc on the outsideand I'm gonna call this out it gave methat longer slider thinking that youmight stretch it into the track you'renot taking this boot to the track thisboot is a sport and sport touring bootit is not a track boot regardless of theheight keep that in mind that is myrecommendation take it to the track atyour peril and the reason is because itneeds additional support up the lateraland medial side that is absolutely whereI come down on this great for sporttouring riding but again not gonna holdup in two types of scenarios you'regonna put it through from a supportstandpoint or protection standpoint atthe track now if we look at some of theother pieces that are baked in here Iactually like the toe reinforcement alot and I like how they've designed thisreinforced area of TPU that comes allthe way up the front toe counterreinforces the front of the toe and thengives you that big shift panel the othernice part of you have a reallyhi arch is the bellows are immense inthis boot so there's a lot offlexibility remember we talked about alot of room in the ankle but there's alot of height if you have one of thosehigher arched feet this is gonna doreally well for you moving around to theback what you can't see is they're aboutthe size of the quarter but you do havemalleolus protectors on the lateral sideand on the medial side you can see thisis the gore-tex version so it saysgore-tex on the outside and one of thethings I really like is they steel theheel right off the v4 and if you workyour way in here you see dual durometerheel so we see our TPR we see our TPUthere's a zinc heel counter along theback that's going to be that area forslide massive and protective this is oneof the features that they get the mostright here on the 500 and the 500 GTX ishow they've baked in the protectionaspect into the heel if you move alongthe inside you're gonna see similarmaterials again synthetic leather amixture of textile as you work your wayback there's also at the top of the shinhere going to be another little pop ofTPR which is going to be just anotherinterface point with your bike dependingon how you ride also give you a littlebit more protection and the shin is kindof in this mid-range for me where I wishit had a reinforced hard part baked onthe inside or I really wish that thisTPU went up a little bit higher theycould do a little bit bigger of a jobhere but I'm not really complaining inthat 300 dollar range for gore-tex andthis amount of functionality I actuallythink there's a ton of bang for the buckhere now the other thing to keep in mindis the durometer factor of the soleremember it's going to be a dual densitydurometer you have it spaced out alittle bit further for walking around inthe parts of your bike that are a littlebit less tactile or responsive whenyou're riding and if you move up hereinto the ball of the foot what's gonnainterface with your peg depending on howspiritedly you ride you're gonna get alittle bit of a tighter configurationand a little bit of a different diameterfor a little bit of a different feedbackso all in you're looking at the GTXversion at the 500 coming in over 300bucks you have the regular versioncoming in the high twos sports fortouring carrying the Puma style out ofGermany and it's nice to see themredefine and redesign a little bitmoving forward next iteration I'd liketo see them make some of the sweepingchanges that address some of the fitissues but it's nothing you can't getover if you heed my advice and just usethe size chart and take a step back downto a lower size go one full size lowerand it should fit your spot on the nextstep of your journey is that click righthere read other rider reviews of theyou Puma 500 and 500 GTX you don't haveto take my

nike wants to just do it adi does tocreate the best productbut what does puma stand forpuma recently signed some excitingsponsorship dealsmanchester city lamela ball and nowneymarthe brand seems committed to attack itsrivals adidas and nike by aggressivelyinvesting into high-profile athletes andteamsand it looks like the strategy isworkingbefore covet 19 puma was the world'sfastest growing sportswear brandthe company almost doubled its revenuewithin five yearsincreasing its sales twice as fast asmarket leader nikeit's been a dream always to be able towork with a brand like pumawe'll explain the strategy behind thatgrowth and why it's all about findingthe right balance between sportswearand fashionto understand puma as a company it'sworth looking at its rootsthe story of the dasla brothers whostarted a shoe factory in their smallgerman hometown of herzoger is famous bynowwithin the first few years teslafootwear became renowned worldwidemany medal winners at the olympics woredustler shoes almost 30 years afterfounding the companythe tesla brothers fell out and wentseparate waysadolf created adidas but only after hisbrother rudolf had founded puma[Music][Applause]the following years puma was shaped bylegendary athletesthat helped to grow the business in 1958the brazilian team took home thefootball world cupwearing puma boots it was also the yearthat the second brand logo was patentedthe form strip originally created tostabilize the footinside the shoe the logo quickly came toprominencethanks to the rise of mass media and thebroadcasting of major sports eventsfor example when the world's fastest manarmin hari won gold at the olympics inromeyou guessed it in puma spikesbut the most important puma ambassadorthroughout the years was probably piliafter the victory in 58 he went on towin two more world cups with brazil andestablished puma as one of the leadingsports performance brandsthe first athlete that pushed the brandmore into a lifestyle direction waswalt clyde frasier he made a name forhimself off the court with his colorfulstylewhen he approached puma and asked for acustom-made pair of sneakerspuma took the chance and launched thepuma clyde the model became a success inthe hip-hop subculturenew york city breakers and a rock steadycrewall original pioneers of music and dancebroke new groundand set a craze of battles across theworld to this dayit was the first proof for puma thatthere was a lifestyle market for theirproductsbut it would take decades before thisinsight would become a key part of theirstrategythey first kept their focus on being acore sports brandand their athletes gave puma the neededcredibilityboris becker the youngest player everwinning wimbledon in 85 or diegomaradona one year later at the fifaworld cuphelped to put puma in the limelight butdespite the athletic successpuma struggled by the early 90s thecompany had been operating in the redsince it went public in 86.it was more and more regarded as anunattractive and cheap brand that wasfound at rummage salesformerly second behind adidas puma hadfallen back to fourth place in terms ofsalesin came a new ceo who turned thingsaroundhe took aim at puma's brand image fromthen onpuma consistently focused on fashion andlifestyle productsin addition to pure sporting goods ithad long been overlooked that mostcustomers bought sport shoes as fashionitemsthe company would form collaborationswith international designerscut its clothing into old couture andpresented it on the paris catwalksas one of the first sports brands pumamerged sports and fashion bycollaborating with star designer janesanderlifestyle versions of football andrunning shoes were launched and suddenlypuma was the market leader in thatsegment the strategy workedin 94 puma made the highest profit inthe company's history to that datethe focus on lifestyle climax whenfrench luxury goods corporation currybought into pumaand became the majority shareholder nowpuma was under the same roof asluxury fashion brands gucci or san lorenunfortunatelythe hype around puma as a lifestylebrand didn't last very longthe strong focus on fashion had damagedpuma's credibility as a sporting goodsmanufactureralthough puma managed to leave theirmark by signing usain bolt and scuderiaferrarithe company failed to commercialize thesuccess and revenue stagnated orfell until 2013. with its roots insports but years of focusing rather onfashionthe brand was missing a consistentpurposeagain a new ceo had to find the answerbjern golden presented a new brandpositioning for the company in 2013.under the mission statement foreverfaster puma aims to become the fastestsports brand in the worldfocusing strongly on the sportscategories of footballrunning and training golf andmotorsportsthe most important words of thestatement are sports brandpuma is hoping the strategic shiftbrings a more performance-based edge toits lifestyle productsand changes the perception of the brandgolden wants puma to return to being asports companyrather than a fashion led lifestylebusiness how does that look in practicepuma unified its sportswear andlifestyle divisionsthose divisions were run separatelybefore which confused bothcustomers and suppliers so instead ofworking next to or even against eachotherthe sportswear and lifestyle teamsunified their forces and work togetherand the forever faster strategy alsoexplains puma's selection of athletesand teamsusain bolt the jamaican national teamformula 1and lately of course neymar not to saythat they only sign fast athletes nowbut at least that's the overarchingstrategy and purpose of the brand pumaquickly had to realize how difficult itcan beto gain back their credibility as asports brandwhen they announced plans to get backinto basketball in 2018they failed to sign a high-profileplayer it isthe week of the nba draft and whois dominating the headlines but pumathey joined forces with the jay-z as acreative director and leveraged theirformer athlete walt frazierthe fact that they were able to sign oneof the biggest names in the musicbusiness but not a single significantbasketball player shows how much thebrand got off trackbut the signing of lamellar ball in 2020shows that they are on the way back tosportsbut despite these obstacles puma isquite successful with the strategywith 5.5 billion euros the companyachieved its highest sales ever in 2019.the struggle for the right balancebetween sports and fashion brandruns through puma's history the twopolls have been the reason for puma'sbiggest successesas well as its biggest challenges itseems that puma just hasn't found theright balance yetbut if they do they might gain furtherground against adidas and nikehaving manchester city lewis

appearanceis pretty cool differentiates the car ireally like this part in particularthe ford performance letters on top ofittwo things i want to point out at therear of the car we have a uniquedefuser for st and the exhaustpretty clean honest design your dualpipe stainless steel slash cutno fake features like some of thecompetitors haveand the exhaust features a valve so thevalve depending on drive mode and drivecondition opens up and itamplifies the raspy i3 sound and whenyou start revving this thing it actuallysounds pretty cool okay so let's talkaboutthe wheels the vehicle comes standardwith 19-inch alloyson two 25-40 tires the rim design thetwo different ring designs there is amagnetite matte painted rim and thenthere is a machinedversion of this rim and this particularcar has the machined rimon the tire it's a michelin pilot 4stirepart of the michelin high performancetire lineup and we developed this tiretogether with michelin specifically forpuma stand there's actually a ford performanceimprinton the tire on the sidewall fp whichindicates that this specification isparticular for puma st and that's a tirethat you can also getvia the michelin aftermarket channelsso let's talk about some of theessential ingredients that actuallymake it an stthe engine it's a 1.5 liter ecoboostwith a manual transmissionit's based on a fiesta sd so it's an i3engine boostedwhich provides a pretty good balancebetweenperformance and efficiencywe upped the torque from 290 newtonmeter in fiesta stto 320 newton meter in puma stand we also shortened the final driveratio slightly to compensate for thelargerwheels so as a result we're gettingpretty good acceleration performancezero to 100 is at 6.7 seconds and vmaxis at 220 kphwe also offer an optional quive limitedslip differentialfor improved front end tractionthe quive in combination with torquevectoring also depending on the drivemodesactually provides really good roadholding and avoids understeer behaviorthere's another key ingredient i need tomention to you which is the brake systemwe actually upsized the brake systemsignificantly versus base pumait has a 325 millimeter disc in thefrontso these brakes really provide sustainedbraking performance also when you'retaking it on the trackwe did take this car to the nurburgringquite a bit during its developmentand the brake system actually behavedquite well out therenow on driving dynamics so obviouslythis car is an suv with a higher centerof gravityso we had to be innovative and clever todeliver thest type driving dynamics so startingwithanti-roll bar in the front a twist beamin the rear which is about 50stiffer versus base pumaand we achieve this by a thickeru-profile and also an addedtorsion bar into the new profile of thetwist beamthen we have unique stiffer bushes allaround on the suspensionwe have a unique knuckleon the car to get us to the road centerwhere we want it to beand also improves the steering ratio andwe haveunique springs and shocks shocks arefrom itachi twin tube in the frontmonotube in the rearthe shocks feature an frd systemfrequency responsive dampeningwhich helps to improve rolling plushnesswhen you're going over smallinputs or rough road surfaces but at thesame timethe shocks have the control that withthe dampening and the control that wewant for an st when you go over biggereventsand then steering steering key for anysti mentioned the knuckle unique geometrybut we also have a uniquesteering rack with a quicker ratio soknuckle in combination with the uniquerack overall delivers a 25 percentquicker steering ratio so the steeringresponseturn in response is actually exceptionalof this carit's key for any st and this carprovides great connected feel so estinasis one thingbut this car remains to offer the suvpracticalityflexible load department withbest-in-class trunk spaceand of course the innovative megaboxwhich features another 80 liters ofadditional storage volumewhich easily fits your most importantgearlet's take a look at the interiorfirst thing that greets you are the fordperformance cuff bladesinside the car the recaro seats areanother key ingredient for stnice side bolstering to provide optimumsight support and also the micro dynamicfabric provides good grip and actuallyalso feelsquite nice and we have metal graystitchingall around a unique gear shift knob ondstwith a red lettering and then thesteering wheel flat button steeringwheel with the sd logo on the bottomand drive mode switches directly on thesteering wheelwe have four drive modes in st echonormal sport and crack now they can beselected by amode button on the steering wheel whereyou basically togglethrough the drive modes and then selectthe oneyou want or there is also an sbutton on the steering wheel it's adirect sport select button so wheneveryou press that buttonyou directly and instantly go into sporti like to call it the fun buttonand typically where you would use thisis when you drive on the road and yousee some somecorners coming and you say okay i wantto do these corners in sport mode maybeand you just simply push it and theninstantly you're in that modeso quite a lot of stuff comes standardon sd it's things like heated seatssteering wheel heated front windshieldparking sensors front and rear 19-inchalloysand then on the interior we have recaroseats standardthere are three optional packs on pumast there's a performance pack whichcontains the quivelsd and launch control and then there isa driver assistancepack and then last but not least thereis a special x packagewhich contains the machined rims and ledheadlampsso this concludes my walk around ofpumasd first europeanford performance suv i hope you enjoyedand learned a bit more about the carwe think it nicely combines the utilityand style of an suv with a stinus andfun to driveorders can be placed from septemberonwards and deliveries will actuallystart right

this is the Puma 365 net fit lighterit's new it has net fit and it's on asworn mission to be the best freestyleshoe ever made because Puma have set outto resurrect one of the best and mostpopular freestyle shoes ever the Pumaarchive light by combining the oldelements with their newest innovationNets it now the thing is that I'm a firmbeliever in the genius of the archivelight so this really has to kick ass toconvince me it can take over the throneto keep the og archives intact the netfit light offer is made of thinbreathable mesh and a rubber outsolebut then drags it into 2018 with a highcollar and the net fit system on theside there's no denying that the net fitlight is pretty comfortable the fit isslightly wide and the upper is extremelysoft and pliable so you don't have anypressure points then there's theaddition of the heel counter which is agood idea because adds a lot ofstability but at the same time itrestricts the mobility of the foot andto be honest I rather be without fitwise the archive lights are really wideand run a full size longso people with narrow feet tend to trythe laces really tight which resulted ina crumble upper the net fit light on theother hand runs only half a size longbut with the introduction of the net fittechnology makes it easier to adjust formore personalized fit no matter whatfoot shape you have but the inclusion ofthe net fake technology also means thatthe rubber linings will restrict themobility of your foot to some extentwhich really is a shame because the netfake technology itself is really amazingsince there is somewhat of a trend toslap a collar on all of the shoes litfit lights are not an exception wellit's a good idea and it's not really inthe way when freestyling I just thinkit's unnecessary and if Puma insists tohave a collar just give us the Evo netcollar from the futuresto freestylers the touch is alpha-omegaand since nothing beats mesh I naturallygot excited when Puma brought it backwe've seen a lot of different uppermaterials ranging from canvas ripstopnylon and four generations of mesh thenet fit light introduces a newbreathable mesh type it sits nice andclose to your foot and offers a goodclean touch on the toe box doesn't feelclumsy either but it does tend to be alittle bit slippery when doing speedytricks like for example 3 evolutiontricks the 365 net fit light has theexact same soul as the old archivelights which is the best soleplate forfreestyle on the market it's made up ofa soft white foam base with two patchesof black rubber for added grip andflexibility which is also why it's lovedby panel flares and freestylers all overthe worldsimply put it's the best outsole thereis and it's a perfect example of why thesaying if it ain't broken don't fix itis absolutely spot-on but one thing ismy opinion as a freestyler I also wantedto hear from a guy licked what one ofthe world's finest panel players thinksof the net fit light the very mostimportant part of the shoe is the soleso let's talk about the solar breakfirstthe sole is asbestos these type ofplayers would like to be close to theground because it's actually not verythick so if you like more think solarmore like this some players like toclean air max and more bigger shoes thisis not going to be the shoe for you thebest part of this off the street socceris the width when you're playing speedsuckers you're moving the ball withwe're all part of the show via so thewider the sole is the more possibilitiesyou have for tricks so this is greatthis is definitely one of the best soulsStreet sucker out there 100% while thesoul is almost at the very best it canbeI think the ankle is absolutely perfectit's very very stiff during the ankle sothe probability of you coming out andtwisting your ankle is actually lowerthe old arc of lights have no stiffnessin the ankle and it was very very bigproblem for street soccer players withtheir with loose ankles so big off thePuma for making mistakeankle three soccer players very happyabout life when you open the box there'sactually three ways and they'reexplained to you how do you can laceyour shoes for example I've laced allthe way out because I like to keep myankle tight in the shoe so this is thegreat Greg Pro for the shoe because youcan get the exact fit that you wantaround the shoe so it would seem likethe net fit light it's a pretty goodfreestyle shoe and it is in fact it'sit's very good but it has one majorproblem and that problem is calledarchived light the thing is Puma set thebar extremely high without even knowingit with the best freestyle shoe to dateand even though there are a handful ofsimilarities between the net fit and theart catch it's the differences thatbreaks it for the net fit the hardenedheel cap the high collar and the way thenet fit was slapped onto the upper arethe things that stand in a way for thisbeing the best freestyle shoe on themarket and it's a shame because it'sreally among the best one out therein other words if I hadn't known of thearchive lights and the spin off forfreestyle explorador - this would havebeen really high off my listit's a great freestyle shoe and Iwouldn't have a problem using this butthere's still room for improvement andcan't quite keep up with Big Brotherarchived light and for a fresh start -hopefully one day improve on thearchived lights is the solid go but asI've always said once you go archivedyou never go backso Puma please prove me wrong in thenext generation for guys if you want tosee some more freestyle content makesure to subscribe by clicking the greenbubble and if you want
