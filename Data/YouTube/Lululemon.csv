[Music][Music][Music]hello everybodyand welcome back to the channel my nameis blair or the illuminati and todaywe're going to take a look at a companythat reportedly has somereally strange off-putting culturebehind it lululemoni actually first found out about thiscompany because a friend of mine saw avideo about the infamous lululemonmurder case and the youtuber they werewatching briefly mentioned lululemonstrange company cultureand that caught her ear and after iwatched the video it most certainlycaught mine tooso today we're going to be mostlyfocusing on the company itself and whatis wrong with lululemon supposed cultureand their multiple controversiesyou guys know it's pretty much the usualhere so let's get right into itto start let's briefly go over thecompany historyin 2009 a new york times article calledmarketing pose readslululemon was founded in 1998 invancouver british columbia by a veteranof the surfer snowboard business namedchipt wilsonhe found a niche in yoga explains ericpeterson the company's head of marketingthat means there was an opportunity tooffer functionality to the seriouspractitionervia stretchy pants and sweat absorbingtops and the likeits promotional strategy revolvesheavily around working with yogainstructors and offering free classes todraw in newbiesaccording to the article in 2009 thebrand was a bit more runneror athlete focused but strangely enoughlululemon also sells rain jacketspeterson says it's due to customerdemand and that is because they're alifestyle brandjust as you don't have to skateboard towear skater pants you don't have to beable to nail a sun salutation pose towear yoga pants they sayand i'm not gonna argue that hell i knowplenty of people that own or wear yogapants all the time but have never done ayoga classthat's fine wear what you want go aroundin a soccer uniform all day if you[ __ ] feel like itmy issue isn't necessarily with theclothes themselves even though some ofthem are a bitcash grabby my issue instead is more inline with what elaine lipson a writerand former editor in boulder coloradothinks of the whole brandaccording to her lululemon is at leastin partresponsible for transforming somethingthat is basically free into somethingvaguely upper classfemale and all about the lifestyle andthe clothes to herlululemon is peddling props that mayoffer a sense of community to some butalienate others who might benefit fromyoga but don't fit what she calls thechain's yoga chick image and attitudenow as irritating as that marketingstrategy is and asmuch as i agree with elaine here thatalone isn't something i'd make into avideocompanies do that type of [ __ ] all thetime and these lifestyle attitudes arenothing newbut what is it about lululemonspecifically that makes the lifestyletheir marketing more dangerous thanothers plain and simpleit stems from their founder chip wilsonand it's the values the company wasfounded on to begin with thatreally causes this whole mess in 2012business insider reported thatfinancially lululemon atletico has gonefrom strength to strength in the lastyearit reported 2011 revenues of 1 billiondollarsup from 712 million the year before forits trendy 98yoga pants but that success came at apricein january founder chip wilson steppedaside and his duties were taken over byceo christine dayafter he generated a string ofunfortunate headlines about his weirdbeliefsthose beliefs included favoring childlabor his disdain for the ability of thejapanese to speakenglish and a love of anne rand and hisopinion that the pillcreated a generation of divorceshattered women now seeking empowermentthrough yoganow where do i even start with all ofthati would love to say that this is just acase of someone with way too much moneybelieving in some weird [ __ ] after yearsof being surrounded by yes men butthat isn't the case chip wilson redatlas shrugged when he was 18 years oldandloved the book which argues that thenaked pursuit of self-interest should besociety's highest ambitionthe book is set in a dystopian world soi mean maybe don't take your life valuesfroman objectivist novel but go off i guesspersonally i'm more of the mindset thatchanging the world for the better inyour own way and finding happiness inthatas well as for yourself is a great moralgoalchip and i don't have to agree on thateveryone has their own difference ofopinion really on these types of thingsandhey at least if a ceo is going to saytheir naked pursuit of self-interest ismost important then at least they'rebeing honest about their stancelike i said in the past if you're gonnabe an [ __ ] be an honest oneso i guess i can't really fault him onthat one but my god are those views real[ __ ]but look i wouldn't call chip an [ __ ]if his moral beliefs were the onlyproblem i had with himhe said some other extremely worryingthings even about the women he marketstofor example women's life changedentirely after the pillmen did not know how to relate to thenew female thus came the era of divorceswith divorce and publicity aroundequality women in the 1970s and 80sfound themselves operating as powerwomen the media convinced women thatthey could winat home and be a man's equal in thebusiness world womenput in 12 hour work days attempted tokeep a clean and orderly house and givetheir childrenall the love they had pre-divorce whatthey gave up however was their sociallifeexercise balance and sleep and the 1980sgave way to power women dressing likemen in boardroom attire with bigshoulder padsthey went to three martini lunches andsmoked because this is what theirsuccessful fathers did in the businessworldbreast cancer also came into prominencein the 1990si suggest this was due to a number ofcigarette smoking power women who wereon the pillinitial concentrations of hormones inthe pills were very highand taking on the stress previously leftto men in the working worldultimately lululemon was formed becausefemale education levelsbreast cancer yoga athletics and thedesire to dressfeminine came together all at one timei okay hmm how do i begin to unpack thisbecausei wow what a piece of [ __ ] i thinkthat's where i need to start butokay let's give me a minute and let mejust get my thoughts together on this soi can unpack iti think the main point here is chip hasactually blamed birth control andsmoking on divorce rates and he treatslululemon as a solution to those thingsi i am 90 sure that's what i just readthe only correlation between divorce andbirth controlif you're straining to find one is thatthe nation's firstno-fault divorce bill made divorceseasier in 1969and the supreme court ruled in 1965 thatmarried couples have a constitutionalright to privacyincluding the right to use birth controlso surei guess an argument could be made thatthough divorces can still be complicateddivorces rose when birth control did butit's not as if one caused the otherplus a rise in divorces is not always ahorrible tragic thingit could mean that spouses found iteasier to escape abusive relationshipsor they were able to leave someone theywere no longer in love withnot being forced to stay in an unhappyunion forever buthere's where it gets worse chip statedthat he gave lululemon its name becauseaccording to chip he believes thatjapanese peoplecan't say the letter l and i'm not[ __ ] kidding youthis is real this is real [ __ ] right nowit was thought that a japanese marketingfirm would not try to create a northamerican sounding brand with the letterl because the sound does not exist injapanese phoneticsby including l in the name it wasthought that japanese consumers wouldfind the name innately north americanand authentic in essence the namelululemon has no roots and meansnothing other than it has three l's init nothing morenothing less he even told canada'snational post business magazineit's funny to watch them try to say itwhat a massive [ __ ] [ __ ]naming it for phonetics and how the wordsounds is finebut that comment really has my bloodboiling heliterally named it to be discriminatoryby naturechips also said that third worldchildren should be allowed to work infactories because it provides them withmuch needed wageshence why he apparently favors childlabor hellhe even took this a step further andeven told the teafrom canada that even in canada there isa place for 12 and 13 year old streetyouths to find work in local factoriesas an alternative to collecting handoutsi look at it the same way wto does itand that isthe single easiest way to spread wealtharound the world is to have poorcountries pull themselves out of povertywilson told the tbalbc executive director penny scott wasat the speech in januaryhe was really raising a gray area anddidn't address the other issueslike where the kids are living whatthey're being paid if they're going toschool if they're being taken care of inthoseother ways scott said vancouver-basedlululemon built its reputation as anethical brand by using local labor tomanufacture its clothinguntil recently lulumin produced most ofits clothingin a non-union shop in east vancouverwith a little more than 100 workersand here's where [ __ ] gets really really[ __ ] despicable okay because luluminwasable to build up a brand in vancouver bybeing ethicalthey used local labor not child laboreven though sweatshops in vancouverare common yet rather than point out howamazing that isand advocate for more companies doingthis [ __ ] chip here has the nerf totell a canadian newsletterthat there's a place for their childrenin factories what absolute[ __ ] and of course their companymantra according to business insider isthatstress is related to 99 of all illnessesand chip argues that if you get sickit's probably your own faultcan stress make an illness worseabso-fucking-lutelycan it even cause someone to be severelysick yesbut show me your sources on that 99number chipor start visiting hospitals and tellingpatients to not be stressed if that'sapparently the source of all [ __ ]illnesses herei'd love to see how that goes for youbut of course he won'tthe most notable comments chip made orat least the most viral comments thatsupposedly led to his resignationwere the fat shaming ones so like wedidn't even get into apparently theworst ones yet these are just the onesthat didn't even make for some reasonhuge headlines whichto me these are horrific enough butlet's keep goingtime reported that lululemon had torecall a line of its pants in junebecause of complaints that the womenbent over to do downward dog and thefabric became see-throughand in the past month customers havebeen grumbling that the new pantmaterial pills which is particularlyenraging giving that they cost 98dollarsin a bloomberg interview on november 8thwilson said in response to questionsabout the pilling and see-through pantsquite frankly some women's bodies justdon't work for the pantsit's really about the rubbing throughthe thighs how much pressure is thereover a period of timeand here's the thing if you're going tocharge pretty much 100or more for a pair of yoga pants youcan't blame a woman's thighs for beingthe reason the material wears outi'm sorry but you just [ __ ] can't ifsomeone buys yoga pants at the dollarstorewalmart whatever you get what you payfor which by the way some of walmart'sdog [ __ ] slaps but anyway that's atotal side notebut if lululemon can't cater to plussizes then they shouldn't sell them inthe first place and most certainlyshouldn't be charging those prices andmost certainly should not be placingblame on them for that eitherafter a week an online petition askinghim to say he's sorrywilson responded by releasing a tearyvideo on the company's facebook pagehe apologized to his employees for therepercussions of his actions sayingseveral times how sad he was abouteverything he'd put them through becauseof all the bad presshe didn't however apologize to theconsumersand personally i think that's not reallyrude but really stupid of lulumen to notcater to plus-sized women or men as amatter of fact with their productsif plus-sized individuals want to gethealthy or lose weight they need thesupport and products to do soand that includes support bras athleticpants lightweight workout shirts youname itand this might sound obvious or reallycheesy but i'm far more motivated towork out and be active if i have a greatsports bra comfy pants and i'm just likei'm looking greati'm feeling great i'm ready to sweat mybrains out like i'm into thatand i feel like that is the case for alot of people at any shape and any sizeso for lululemon to say that theirproducts just don't work for plus sizepeopleis they're only really nasty and trashyand alienatingbut it's extremely stupid and it's aterrible marketing move considering plussize women that demographic like thatmarket shareis huge now especially in the us andyou're just excluding those salesentirelyand chip's apology to his employees butnot the consumersit's pathetic hell even some formerlululemon employees have said thatdiscouraging plus size customers hasactually been part of the brand strategya size 10 or 12 which are the largestsizes they makecan be hard to find in an urbanlululemon store and no customer wants toendure the embarrassment of asking aclerk to go find a bigger sizeso sure chip i bet you're real sorrythat sounds like you'revery sorry if that's been built intoyour sales culture oh yeah so sorrynow look i've given chip a ton of craphere and deservedly so i might addbut apparently he already stepped downin 2014 and as of 2016made a website to criticize his owncompany and say how it had fallendownhill without himlike can you imagine founding a companyhaving to step down because ofcontroversial or rude and garbagestatementsand then going to make a website to thencriticize that companythis guy's like bananas i i don't evenknow what to make of himbut enough about chip for now we'regoing to get into lululemon itselfbecausethey have more problems than a horriblefounder on their handsso first we're going to get into thefalse advertising issues herein 2007 lululemon began selling a newline calledvitus c that the company said was madewith seaweedprobably as a way of jumping on thatall-natural trend even further sincethey already had clothes made withbamboosilver charcoal coconut and soybeans iget wanting your food to bemade healthy but i've never heard ofclothes being made out of soy beanscool concept but i've literally neverheard of it before maybe i'm justa little more out of the loop with thefashion trends than i thought but anywaythe fabric according to the product tagsreleasesmarine amino acids minerals and vitaminsinto the skinupon contact with moisture lululemonwhich has received positive mediacoverage for its fabrics also says thevita c clothingmade from seaweed fiber supplied by acompany called c-cellreduces stress and providesanti-inflammatory antibacterialhydrating and detoxifying benefitsthere is one problem with its vitacyclaims howeversome of them may not be true the newyork times commissioned a laboratorytest of a lululemon shirt made of vitacyand reviewed a similar test performed atanother laband both came to the same conclusionthere was no significant difference inmineral levels between the vitacy fabricand cotton t-shirtsin other words the labs found noevidence of seaweed in the lululemonclothingand there's notif available actually put it on and wearit it is different from cottonthat's my only test of it he said idon't know whether to laugh or bang myhead against a wall over such astatementput it on and it felt different thancotton that doesn't make itseaweed like what the [ __ ]that doesn't mean you can run aroundtelling people it's seaweed when it justisn't i just can't tell people that mymerch is made from 100rare sheep wool from icelandic mountainsor some [ __ ] because i want to orbecause it feels different than regularshirts like that'snot how it works now canada was actuallyon the ball for this one and got them toremove these products but as of writingthisthey still have vitacy fabrics listed ontheir website andit's described like it's some cuttingedge technology sohere's the realty about it so sorry toruin that for anyone listeningplus for being so high in price theymay not always be high quality in march2013l.a times article says it seems thatlululemon a vancouver-based company hadto recall some of its yoga pants becausethey were toosheer this is not it turns out a minorproblemwhen i heard about the scandal atlululemon the canadian company thatmakes expensive yoga clothes iimmediately called my dear friend juliea yoga fanatic in santa barbarajulie is one of these dual americancanadian citizens who cannot discussanything that is remotely canadianwithout telling you soit's a canadian company she repliedthey're the rolls-royce of yoga clothessuper expensive as julie pointed outhoweverit's not just the adorably namedlululemon that has a problem withsee-through yoga pantsmany brands when stretched just so aresheerone time julie said i was in class andthe woman in front of me bent down and iwas kind of thinkingyou should be wearing somethingunderneath that it's not super offensiveand you won't see it when they'rewalking down the street it's only whenthey bend over and their butt's in yourfaceis this a gigantic issue again thisalone would not be worth making anentire video onplenty of clothing companies haveoverpriced products and that theproducts underperform in certain areasit's my opinion you pay for the brandname sometimes butcombined with everything else that we'vegone over so far it's kind of startingto add up that there's a little morethan just the surface level of theseleggings are a little sheernow we've touched on this briefly beforebut when talking about how lululemonemployees discourage plus size consumersbut now we're actually going to dig in alittle deeper into the disturbingculture behind lululemonone huffpost article written byelizabeth licorice goes into howincredibly weird and cultish the wholeplace can behere's what she said the lululemonculture consistson the surface of catchy manifestoslululemon wants you to know it'selevating the world from mediocrity togreatness andcreating components for people to livelong healthy and fun livesbut dig deeper and you'll learn aboutlandmark forum the ultra secretiveeerily cultish educational series whichlululemon employees are stronglyencouraged to attendbefore you're in line for landmarkyou're bombarded with brian tracymotivational cds and a book club thatculminates with atlas shruggedsuccessful lululemon employees canrecite brian tracy better than thepledge of allegiancemention chip wilson lou lemon's founderand former ceoand their eyes will light up and quicklyglaze over they'll tell you quiteseriously that he saved their lives byelevating them to greatnessall of this sort of made walking intowork feel like time traveling to salembecause with the lululemon creed andcatechism comes a collective mentalitythat thrives on scapegoats and leavesyou feelingworthless if you subsist on anything butspring water and kaleonce another employee sneered at me fromacross the floor and said the soda ihappened to be enjoying would rot mefrom the inside outeventually we were all issued reusableacrylic cups and forbidden to drinkanything but h2o we'd be encouraged togive feedback a terrible calculatedmisnomer for ruthless criticism thatcould veer from professional to personalin 60 seconds flatif a customer dismissed your sales pitchbecause let's say he was in a bad moodone of your fellow teammates would pullyou aside and say your conversationalstyle lacked genuine authenticityshe'd insinuate that you lackauthenticity that you aren't equippedenough as a human to sell yoga pantselizabeth even speculates that it wasthis creepy environment that may havesent an already psychologicallyemotional vulnerable person over theedgewhen brittany norwood murdered janetmurray a fellow employee at the storeand norwood didn't simply attack murrayshe actually tried to stage it as acrime scene after stabbing murray andusing a hammerwrench and mannequin peg to inflict over300 wounds on murray before she diednorwood was sentenced to life in prisonwithout the possibility of parolethankfully andi really can't speculate as to what itwas that made her do thismost sources i've seen cite norwoodstealing from the company as the causeor at least a very large reason as towhy she snapped and did thisthat article from huffpost saying it'spart of the culture surethat's a possibility but i can't blamelululemon without evidence orimply that they should take someresponsibility without proofi don't know how many people have hadelizabeth's experience at lululemonif you did feel free to let me know inthe comments section because if it'strueit's definitely worrying and as for aside note about the wholetrue crime stuff about the murder i havebeen watching so many of thosedocumentariesand every single time they say like thatthere's an excessive amountof like stabbing gunshots whatever likein excessive amounts of likelike damage i guess i don't that'sprobably not the right way to phrase itbut like when you excessively murder the[ __ ] out of someoneit's usually motivated by like anger orsexual stuff or whateverand this definitely sounds like that wasmotivated by a lot of [ __ ] anger soto think it's just stealing from thecompanylike to me that doesn't make sense buti'm not a crime scene investigator oranything sotake that with a pinch of salt inaddition to this huffpost articleother sources have come out witharticles about lululemon's strangebehind-the-scenes activitiesone article from cnbc in 2018 statedthat the ceolaurent potdevon had a multi-yearrelationship with a female designerthey continued to say the sportswearretailer on mondayannounced pot devon's resignation sayinghe fell short of standards of conductto respect employees and show integritysources previously told cnbcit was not one particular action thatled to the resignationlululemon's board has started searchingfor a new global ceopot devon's relationship with thedesigner is one of severalinstances in which he demonstrated alack of leadership at lululemon sourcestell cnbcformer employees say he had a negativeimpact on the company culturewhich they described as toxic anytimeviolations of company policy orstandards of conduct are brought to ourattention we takeappropriate action a spokesperson forlululemon saidthis may not go into extreme detailabout that toxic culture butconsidering that lululemon is creditedas being the first to kick off the crazeof the athleisure trendit's not hard to believe that the powerinfluence and moneygot to their heads the wall streetjournal also published an articleonline video attached where they saythat as opposed to data analytics theywould spy on customersnow at first it sounds like they justwant to ask customers questions whatthey likewhat you don't like you name it there'snothing wrong with that gatheringfeedbackis a good thing but this is literallyeavesdropping they position theirfolding tables by the dressing roomconsciously writing what customers aresaying and reporting back to the ceothey even have chalkboards in thefitting rooms where customers can writedown what they like and don't likebut supposedly the ceo literally stoppedproduction on a sweater when a customercomplained about the fit of the sleevesso one person's feedback was soimpactful that it just erased a productfrom existencei think it's really just the listeningin that bothers me hereif an employee came up to me and askedme what i thought of their products tohelp them improvei'm all for that but to feel like i'mbeing watched or spied on in their storein their dressing roomsnot so much plus getting rid of the dataanalyticsand the reasons behind this doesn't seemlike a great answer either but rathermaybe they should use it in combinationwith listening to the customersthat could be just me but personally idon't know anyone that would be thrilledabout a clothing company store employeelistening to them through a fitting roomdoor or curtainnow all of this being said i personallybelieve there's justbetter places for yoga pants i don'tthink chip deserves anyone's money givenhis blatant racist fat shaming andsexist remarksthe environment has been called toxic anumber of times their products areoverpriced i can't find anythingworth buying from like this place like98very good pants like y'all have got tobe [ __ ] kidding me i am not doingthatif you really love lululemon as a brandobviously i can't stop you from buyingfrom them and nor would i really want

known asthe ABC pant do you know what a B Cstands for know what anyone else like totell you he said always be comfortableno anyone else want to hazard a guessproblem anti ball crushing that is whatthese pants are chip I didn't know thatyou were gonna solve a problem that Ididn't even know I had where did thiscome fromwell I that branding well then you knowthat's what interesting because in theanti ball crusher what I named it thatABC the I just wanted to call it the NEball crusher pant but the company wasgetting big and it was scared aboutsocial media and what people would thinkand so they're laughing they're afraidof what people with me know know and soso they wouldn't call it that so theycall it the ABC pant and I noticed justthis last week after seven years thatfinally decided to call it the any ballcrusher pantyeah and so you know it's just part andparcel of like a come to getting bigwell chip it works okay yeah yeah I knowyeahthat's TMI right that's too much Bagoninformation let's talk about yourbusiness history and and you like a lotof entrepreneurs you can't get theentrepreneurial bug out of your systemyou keep going and going and goingyou've had multiple careers Lululemonthe one that is most famous now kittenace you could have sat back and donenothing what is it about entrepreneursthat makes them want to do it over andover I think there's a there's a passionof course but there's an idea that comesto mind so an idea that's not out therein the world and you're right I don'thave to go to work another day in mylife but I go is my idea right is doesthe world actually want what I think itwants and I can't stop from fromcreating it to find out if what I'mthinking is true you want validation ohyeah yeah exactly yeah is it anaddictionsure sure it's an addiction but absentthat what is there in life other thanfamily right let's talk about theorigins of Lululemon going way back tellus when tell us what and and what I meanthere is what was the opportunity thatyou saw or the problem you wanted tosolve and why did you think you were theguy to do itwell I because I came out of the surfskate snowboard business in thesnowboard business that was when girlscuz they were about 14s first startedcoming into athletics and I started tomaking first layer clothing for them andI recognized that men didn't know how toset up a store they didn't know how tobuy from and they knew nothing aboutathletics so I that was all's in my mindand I made these first layer of pantswhich because it went through the wholesale system were too expensive and so Ionly sold 57 worldwide so when when Isold West Beach and I and I had a bunchof things that would make me want to doLululemon I'd had all these women aroundthe world that we're asking me for thesepants and I said no no I can't do it butthen I remembered oh at West Beach Imade a million dollars a year on thesetwo small vertical retail stores and Ilost a million dollars on thisthan this global wholesale business so Imean if I can deliver through thevertical business then I can deliverthose pants at a price that women willbuy in volume so it was really the themove from trying to sell through a lotof channels to having your own storeswhere you could focus on your productsdo the stores your way your productswould stand outyeah and control the brand but todaythey this is the really the key and thekey is is that it's a technical productand going through the wholesale channelsI couldn't get that I couldn't get thepeople that are working in like Dick'sSporting Goods or somebody to actuallydescribe what the customer couldn't seebecause so much of it was in the fabricor the construction but going direct tothe customer then and training people inthe correct way in our stores I couldbridge that gap and you'll notice thatquickly after that Apple and Teslafollowed into that same pattern theirown stores vertical focused on theirproduct and their product alongtechnical product made beautiful directto the customer technical is is yourcompany today kid an ace or the companyyou you run with your wife and son andand and would you describe Lululemon asa technology company as much as it is aretailer or a fabric company well Iwould first call Lou lemon and kit nicepeople development companies leadershipdevelopment companies that was thatthat's the number one goal followed upby being a technical apparel company yeswhat's the best advice you ever got asyou were moving through at Lululemon andand and now what's the best businessadvice you ever got it can be advice youtook or you didn't take well cash flowso never grow beyond cash flow I mean Ihave tons of experiences which took methrough that being in an oil company inCanada went top and to the bottom out ofcash flow and when I was at West Beach II could see where it was the wholesalebusiness that was actually impeding mycash flow whereas in vertical retailingI knew I was getting cash every how doyou know you've got a cash flow problemwhat about what are the numbers what doyou look at or do you just know wellhere's how it works is that is that if II know that I pay all my suppliers inseven days and I do that because I getthe best technology and I get the bestsewers I get the best delivery if if Idon't have the money to do that then Iget none of those things and I get poorqualityso I usually shows up first off in poorquality so you see that first and that'syour tip-off that there may be a cashflow cash flow issue so the best adviceyou ever got was to focus on cash flowright what was the best advice or apiece of advice that you wish you hadtaken but didn't - I'm a very trustingperson I think that's the basis of mypersonality and I the advice that I Igot which didn't take was you know getan aggressive good lawyer in your pocketbecause if if as a leader I know that ifI have good at one thing and that's partof my trustworthiness attracts a certainamount of people then I've got to havesomebody on the other side of me thatisn't trustworthy that can actuallyfilter through people that that beat thesystem by not producing a good productbut actually are working a Machiavelliansystem I would think I don't know thisand I don't mean to put words in yourmouth but I would think that a lot offounders of businesses or CEOs ofcompanies feel that they need to knoweverything and be the expert oneverything under their Thunder is thatis that a temptation do you think for alot of business owners and/or should theCEO know everything that's going on noabsolutely not i when I had West Beachwhich was my surf skate snowboardcompany I wanted to know everything Ihad to be in every decision and soconsequently it got it got to 15 billionmillion dollars or so and you know I wasyoung and that was a lot of money at thetime but it had hit the ceiling becauseI had to be there all the time when Istarted before I started Lululemon Iread a book called the e-mythwhich was about the the entrepreneurialthat entrepreneur has all the time inthe world of themselves that can controltheir own lives and everyone knowsthat's a complete lie but basically itwas said he said to set up the businessas though it's a franchisable so put allthe systems in place and processes andso that you can you know go out withyour family on the weekend or you can goon holiday and that's really how Loulambi came the ability to become highlyreplicable once I found out it was a aworld-class business so you need to youneed to know what you need to know butother things you need to let go and letother people handle how hard is thatwell once what's very doing it I guessyes exactly exactly once you start doingit and you see that instead of being inevery decision but by changing to beinga mentor and a trainer of quality peopleand seeing what it's like to releasepeople and let them let them go it's Imean for me it's it's actually the mostexciting part of the business as youlook back on your career and you thinkof when I asked you to think of threeimportant things that you learned thatbusiness builders like the people inthis room could benefit from knowing andI'd like to ask it in a sort of stagedway and maybe you answered it when youtalked about cash flow but what is themost important thing a start-up businessbuilder needs to know what is the mostimportant thing as you move from thatstartup phase into the scale-up phasewhat do you need to know and then whatdo you need to know once a business isat scale and mature so that you can keepbuilding it keep it growing so fromearly to middle to late what are thewhat are the things that you need toconcentrate on because I'm not thatsharp I'll probably lose track as I kindof go wrong but I as you talk to me allthree of them are combined because Igoing back to the e-myth again when Iwhen I I set up the training the how tohire peoplethe quality systems and so within thatthen was also what is what is thetraining and what is the culture withinwithin West Beach blue lemon kitten aceand I based it on five things and onewas the landmark course which teachesabout integrity responsibility and andand then that book good to great by JimCollins about about being great sevenHabits of Highly Effective People whichI imagine everyone knows the goal byRosenblatt about lean production and andthen the psychology of achievement byBrian Tracy it's about eight hours ofCDs now what this did because I onlywanted one store and I actually didn'twant to work that hard I I set this inplace had all the employees listened toit and then I found I could do it in twoweeks and I found I had the mostphenomenal employees like unbelievableespecially for twenty and thirty yearolds that who are confused about theirlife and and it sets them in place butthe big picture what I'm trying to sayhere going through the three stages isit sets up something called a linguisticabstraction so it's a common set ofterms definitions that the company hasand I'd say I have about twenty five ofthem or so that no matter if you're inTokyo Munich Vancouver Denver everyemployee understands what the meaningsof those are so the ability tocommunicate back and forth with trustand integrity is exponential and that isimportant at any of the stages of growthcorrect I don't think once you breakthat bridge then you end up withdisparate companies let's I want to Iwant to talk about the importance of theof the landmark training which was oneof the hallmarks of of Lululemon get youto spend a second on that but but I wasin one of your stores where I boughtthese anti ball crushing pants and andthe the young woman who was there whowas the manager of the store mm-hmm Iasked I I had just spoken to you on CNBCthe day before and I said you know I youI don't mean the name drop but I wasjust talking toto to chip the other chip Wilson who Ididn't I didn't call you Flip Wilsongive me credit for that okay and and andshe said how long you worked with thecompany said six years she'd beenassumed that manager the store her namewas Zoe and I said so you must love itand she said I love this company I saidwhat do you love about I said I love theculture of the company and and a lot ofbusiness leaders talk about creating aculture and to some people from theoutside that feels like a an abstractionokay it feels like something that's alittle bit up there in the clouds and soforth how does culture translate to thebottom line well I had this statementabout giving without expectation ofreturn and there's something about beinga person like that that I think the lawof attraction kicks in and people wantto be around people that are willing togive without expectation of return sowhen people came to Lou Lemon andkidneys instead of waiting for them toshow up as good employees and thentraining them to be great we wouldassume that they're great right off ofthat but they just need the tools so asI was saying the twenty and thirty yearolds are showing up to work but reallyforty percent of their brain is beingtaken up by will I ever get to travelwill I ever be able to buy a house whathappens when my parents get old will Iever be able to retire all these things40% of the brain power so to be able tocalm that brain down and hand give thesepeople direction is like is one theysucceed in life because we we set it upso there's a plan for them to get towhat they want to get in life and thenthey succeed it how do you pick theright people how do you hire what do youlook for and someone who's gonna work inone of your stores what do you want wellfor for me that I have to draw a linesomewhere people always thought that LouLemon was in the wellness business butI'm not not even a little bit likethat's to mehere in the wellness business and you'retrying to make people healthy and thatmeans they're sick so Lou lemons reallyin the Jim Collins book again we're inthe good people are good and we're outto make them great you're out to makethem great tell me about a mistake youmade as you went on your entrepreneurialJurek journey one that that you learnedfrom something that would help thepeople in this room yeah let's let's saythey the big the big mistake I made wasI had recognized this new market thathad never existed before and it was atwenty five to thirty five-year-oldeducated professional stylish travelingathletic woman and because I learnedthat 60% of women graduating at auniversity were women in 1980 1998 and Iknew it was going to transform the worldand so in retail women had never beengiven a good job because it was really adumping ground for a woman that wereworking for a minimum wage that we'regonna go and have babies and I knew thatthat was going to change so not only didwe hire these highly educated woman whowould who would be direct conduits towho our direct market was but I was outto train them to be the best leaders inthe world and in fact that did happenand we made many of themmultimillionaires but they came in at 22and by the age of 32 or so we had we hadmatured and so we had because we hadmatured we needed people with experienceso people that were 4550 started cominginto the company and and we hired womenat that era now the woman the woman thatthat were in Lululemon I called them thesuper girls and I call these women thatcame into the company soup power womanand they had really had to fight throughthe whole man issue like because thenthey really had to fight tooth and nailand they they learned all the corporatebackstabbing the Machiavellianprinciples and and so when they gothired one of their principles was not toTrain anyone under them to take overtheir job I think it was justself-preservation these were the thepower wind power woman they had alreadyhad experience yeah they'd had beenburned the exact knifed whatever rightand they had they had a way of operatingI don't even think they knew how theywere operating but what they didn't dois they didn't train and develop thesesuper girls that were now 32 to be thenext level and so at some point when thecompany started failing about three orthree years ago and got rid of the CEOand maybe the six woman under them thenthese woman that should have beendeveloped and should have been the nextthe next stage of great executivesdidn't get promoted to that position andLululemon hired all men and it's one ofthe things I'm very sad about I want toget to the audience if we could bring upthe lights I'm sure you guys have somequestions for chip in the 10 minutes orso that we have left that was a veryinteresting that was a very interestingthing there and it goes to the questionof you know you've obviously departedthe company you now are remain itslargest shareholderdo you regret taking Lululemon publicwell obviously that's something that'sprobably way over the horizon for mostof the people in this room but maybesome already or thinking about it buttalk to me about that yes and no in thisin the moment I had I I it was my choiceto do that I had two older boyswho I never really saw because I wasworking so hard at my first company andwhen I had one I in 2005 to seven-nightmy my wife and I had three boys underthe age of two and I was determined thatI wanted to spend you think you wereworking hardshe continues to tell me she wasn'tready right and she's right but I wantedto be the father that I always wanted tobe with the white picket fence and bethe football coach and all that type ofthing so you know I chose that well if Iwas going to do the Lululemonwas on this rocket ship that it wasgoing to be I was not going to be afamily man so I chose them to go publicyou know and of course everything thatkind of came with being public isexactly what happened but probably mybiggest mistake in it was I I didn'tunderstand that I needed a bigger boardof directors in my private board ofdirectors no one really told me that andwithin three months we had to get allthese new directors and they weren't theculture of Lululemon and when my when mytwo private equity guys who were theculture exited I ended up with a boardthat didn't understand how the culturerelated to profits and so that was thedoubt that was then the downfall of whatcould have been the greatest company inthe world all right let's go to us somequestions from the audience there's oneright there please company culture issomething that's talked about so oftenand I feel that not a lot of peopleunderstand how to create it you continueto talk about company culture and youthink that it was your effectiveness andunderstanding how to lead Millennialsthat results in the success of Lululemonyou know I'm sorry I didn't you're wellenough sorry I'll repeat the questionand it's a little broad but companyculture is something that's discussed somuch and I feel that not a lot of peopletruly understand how to create a companyculture that's going to attract theMillennials those twenty thirty yearolds that are trying to figure out whatthey want to do with their life like youdiscussed in the talk do you feel thatit was your effectiveness of being ableto relate understand and readMillennials that led to the success ofLululemon well let's be clear likeMillennials are now and I think in in in1998 to 2010 it was a differentgeneration I think it was at the timewhen pre Millennials so I'm not I'm notpretending to be an expert atMillennials and in fact I'm in businesswith my 27 year old son and I leave himto be the expert at that night and Ithink I would be out of my realm to beto talk about that but definitely in inthe 2000s there was a there was a needfor what they call balance of life andand so people went looking for you knowhow much timespend on health family business what Ido know starting at around 2008 2009 isthe amount of digital information comingacross our boards was was exponentialand and very few people were fish thatcould see the water so to speak andthere had to be a different context in adifferent way of defining balance and sobalance for me started then come out ofmindfulness and powering down poweringup like you would have done an old howhard drive and understanding thatbalance is really choosing every momentof your life about what's the mostpowerful thing I want to do right nowyou are the question go ahead I'llrepeat it if you just stand up and standup you would like here we go so I have acomment followed by a question so I'vebeen near stores multiple cities over along period of time and I think it'ssafe to say that the traditional retailexperience when you walk into a storesome employees are engaged some aren'tyou can tell who wants to be there andwho doesn't the consistent trend I'veseen at your stores as I would say ahundred percent of employees I'veinteracted with are completely engagedwhether it be late at night early in themorning on a holiday because your storesdon't shut down and I guess my questionis as you grew because initially whenyou were smaller I understand by youcreating the culture you can teachtrained develop people but how did youprevent it from eroding over timebecause again I've been - I've been 5060 cities your stores are everywhereit's very consistent well - there's twovery key people that one is SuzanneConrad who has a company called I callyou and she she coaches Lululemonmanagers especially where they'reblocked or they're not getting they'renot getting what they want they don'tunderstand what it is about theirpersonality that they can change orchoose in order to get through thatblock and go forward and the otherperson is tooSwitzer who was the EVP of retailoperations e-commerce for right frombeginning of Lululemon up until she quitabout six months ago and these peoplewere they they lived for giving withoutexpectation of return and setting upthat culture so this so part of it thennow that I meant kit anis the firstperson I hired was somebody who I wasmaking sure that the culture stayed atthe head office as well as the retailstores because these two things can't beseparated and I think this is an issueat Lululemon right now you are known aspart of the culture you created you areknown to be a stickler for punctualityyeah you are you are on lombardi timefive minutes early is late right why ispunctuality so important and and and ifyou're not punctual what does it whatwhat breaks down derivatively well let'sbe clear I'm kind of like a born-againsmoker born-again Jesus Freak I I wasprobably the worst person in the worldaround integrity so I talk about a lotto keep myself in check so I was acompetitive recovering after recoveringso I was competitive swimmer for 18years or so and so that's like eightworkouts a week at a week and you're ontime for like all my life and when I gotin a competitive swimming I I decided Iam never showing up anywhere on time forthe rest of my life I was so done withit and what I found three years later isI had no friends because I wouldn't showup for parties I wouldn't show up for adate I wouldn't didn't care and sonobody called me up again so it took meabout three more years to to fix that upbut what I what integrity is reallydoing what you say you're going to dowhen you say you will do it and if Ican't get it done then that's okay youknow I can't always get it done becausemaybe my mum goes in the hospital and Ican't make a meeting so but it's myresponsibility to clean the mess up thatI that I that has encouraged from me notbeing integrity so if I had to be atthat meeting I couldn't make it and I'mgo call those people go okay I'm reset anew date and then what do I have to doto to recover my integrity with thesepeople and actually by by recovering theintegrity and doing what needs to getdone to clean up my mess I actually showup up as a person with more integrity wetalk about just ask you a little bitabout money I think I can anticipateyour answer here is the desire is thedesire is the desire to maybe I can't isthe desire to make money a good reasonto go into business that's question oneand question two as having money changedyou i I think some people love the gameof making money and I think that thenthey look for a business that will makethe money and that's exciting I saw Ithink that's one type of person I mean Idefinitely fall into the other type ofperson where I would have done what Idid 18 hours a day for a hundred yearsand if I'll as long as I could feed myfamily and and get to work and keep foryou as we talked a moment ago was thenourishment of of having your ideavalidate exactly that said that was whatwas moment has money changed you know Idon't think you could probably talk toanybody that knows me and I have notchanged one bitbecause it's not what it's not whatmotivates me or drives me anotherquestion is there somebody else yes goahead over here over heregood afternoon my name is Gerren brewerreally glad to be here thank you forcoming out I wanted to ask you earlieryou mentioned that part of your successhas come from having trust in your teamand I was having trout in your tent andtrust in your team and I was reallyinterested to know is that why you madethe decision to leave the board ofdirectors of Lululemon no I made thedecision to me that make believe theBoard of Directors because to to do thisis really interesting to have a boardand a public company you have to havethree committees and you have to havethe type of people that want to be oncommittees and who are more Kuanviable driven okay so so then if youhave you don't want any more than eightor nine ten people the most in any kindof meeting but in order to fill thecommittees you basically have to haveeight people that are quantifiabledriven and they want to see numbers andthey cannot understand a vision or afuture or things that cannot bequantifiable so a public board does notallow for a visionary and I thinkthere's nothing more clear than when Isaw the Apple movie with Steve Jobs andyou could see that that the board isdriven to margins or what are costing orsomething that's totally irrelevant tothe big picture and so if I was to redoa board of directors a I'd make sure Ihad a and B class shares and I'd makesure I had at least four people on therethat were entrepreneur visionaries thatcould control the quantifiable board ofdirectors yes oh go ahead right here goahead pleaseyep that Lululemon would reach theyounger girls I have a daughter andshe's been in your store since she wasnine and so my question is when you hadyour strategy and you did your marketresearch for your demographic had youany awareness that these younger girlswe're going to populate your stores aswell it wasn't important to me and I saythat that my target market was a thirtyyear old professional athletic singlewoman who owned her own condo and travelI could care less about the 29 year oldor the 31 year old from a branding pointof view now what I did know is that the30 year old woman is iconic for a womanthat are 20 and women that are 40 and Ialso knew that looking at the landscapeof athletic wear there was no heartthere was no difference there was nosegmentation of market marketsegmentation between old young religionrace whatever athletics as athletics isathletics and it hits everybody let meconclude before we go to lunch I believeme will go a couple more more questionover here up front go aheadhello go so I work in branding anddesign I just had two quick questions wearen't in design branding and designokay great how did you decide onLululemon obviously it's a little bitlonger of a name and stuff so it's justinteresting to me that you went withthat and then also how did I start onLulu our name yeah okayand then obviously everybody knows whoyou are today is a brand in terms ofyour identity but in the early days whenyou were just one two three stores howdid you kind of control who you were asa brand and get that I didn't need crossto your customerI'll tell the this everyone loves thestory of why I named it Lululemon saltI'll start with that I when I had WestBeach my surf skate snowboard company Ihad a skateboard brand called homelessand I sold it for three or four yearsand I was doing quite well in Japan withitEurope and but snowboarding was takingoff and and that's where the marginswere and I went you know skateboardingis on its way down I'm gonna I'm notgonna do it anymore and what what madeit even more special is I couldn'ttrademark homeless cuz hom is French formale and it was there was too many namesout there like that so I went to thedistributors around the world and I saidI'm not doing homeless anymore andthat's the way it is well the next yearshowing the Japanese the snowboard arethe snowboard brand and after they dothat they go mmm mr. chip said we'rehomeless I said I told you guys I'm notdoing it gave him the reason again nextyear same thing mr. chips then we'rehomeless and I said I'm not doing it youdon't that's that's that though theycalled me up a couple months later andthis is when again I'm in the wholesalebusiness so cash flow is like hurtingall over and any kind of money is goodand they go mr. chip said we want to buynamed homeless from you and I went wellI'm not using it it's I'm not making itit's complete air and the Japanese yenis its entire at a complete hi therebuying Pebble Beach and every buildingin New York they can and so I went so Igave them a price I thought wasridiculous and they went mmm ok and Iwent oh Jesus that's the easiest money Iever made in my life and so after thatand I sold West Beach and I started tothink in my mind well why did they lovethe name so much and it's because theletter L is not in the Japanese languageand Japanese wanted only American brandnames and so the the five big tradingcompany country companies in Japan werecoming up with all these American brandnames to sell to their Japanesecustomers but because homeless had theletter L in it I understood that thecore customer thought of homeless asbeing a more authentic American brandbecause it had an L in it because noJapanese firm would come up with a namewith an L in it so then I went to mycell phone and ah so now I'm going tostart I'd need to come up with a namewith three L's in it so if I ever if Iever sell that companyI can get three times as much but finalquestion you have been a critical of thecurrent 3l company its board itsmanagement do you want your company backand whether you do or you don'twhat's the one thing you think that thecurrent team there needs to do thatthey're not doing well it's grosslyunderperformed the market in the lastthree years you know Under Armour andIKEA 50 and 80 percent above the marketS&P has been 19 a bus percent aboveLululemon I mean Lululemon's actuallydropped maybe 14 or 15 percent to theS&P over the last three years sosomething's very very wrong in the midstof the largest change in the way peopleare dressing in the history of the worldso it's way underperforming so then yougo well if it's been underperforming forthree years it's really four and a halfbecause a lot of decisions get made youknow prior to that so if that's notworking then the then it's got to be theboard it's not the CEO it's the Board ofDirectors because the Board of Directorsnominates the CEO if it's the Board ofDirectors is underperforming why wellit's got to be because this we can't wecan't vote for the all the whole slatebecause only three members come up ayear staggered stagers word and they'reprotecting themselves and they'reprotecting themselves because they'redoing such a lousy job so then you kindof go well who's responsible for thatand you go can only land right on thenominating Governance Committee foragain not changing to not to beclassifying the board and not notchanging the board in order to assesswhat a good CEO is in order to takeadvantage of the biggest change in waypeople are dressing in the history ofthe world so the answer is you wouldchange the governance structure of thecompany if I went back right do you wantit backno I don't think I don't want I don'tthink they can afford me and but theymean I this is what I said if if they'repaying you know if they paid me ahundred million dollars a year maybe butyou know and I could make it billionsand billions but you know they'd preferto pay somebody tomillion dollars a year to lose money soyou know that's just the way a publicstructure works I'm gonna end it on thatnoteyes sure thank you very much pleasure[Applause],22,UCC69dxCZQB9VURlHQ8wesPA,Inc.,13,7,0,276,"['lululemon', 'Chip Wilson', 'Tyler Mathisen', 'chip wilson interview', 'live conference', 'chip wilson apology', 'business ted

happy to go onthe website and see a detailedcomprehensive reportof the changes they're going to makeover the next 10 yearsthat's promising none of us are perfectnot our corporationsand not as as us as individuals but ifwe'rehonest about where we are and we'retransparent about our flawsbut then make goals to be better to donew things to make new choiceswell that's all we can ask of anybodybecause none of us are perfect andthat's what i see lululemon doingso as i read this report here's just afew things that stuck out to me they'recommitted to havingfla fair labor association accreditationby 2025.they're here to be giving effortssupporting organizations that teach yogaand meditation to communities in needone of those being yoga behind bars thisisa program for teaching yoga in prisonsi practice yoga and meditation regularlyi get so much out of it things that ican discover about myselfmy decisions my thoughts and mybehaviors in the worldso what an incredible resource this isfor

Lululemon is still in a bit of troublebecause of their alleged shear yogapants remember they were in the newsmonths ago because many people wereconcerned about their hundred dollaryoga pants and how they were too sheerfor yoga classes well it turns out thatchip Wilson who was the founder of thecompany has released a statement aboutit and he admits that they made amistake however women are at fault aswell so I want to read you exactly whathe had to say yes now he spoke toBloomberg and he said there's no doubtthat we made a mistake women will wearseat belts that don't work or they'llwear a purse that doesn't work or quitefrankly some women's bodies justactually don't work for it referring tothe yoga pants they don't work for somewomen's bodies it's about the rubbingthrough the thighs and how much pressurethere is so he is basically implyingthat a woman's body type is the reasonfor the Sheerness of the yoga pants sohe's saying if you're fat and youstretch it out then it seems sheer butif you were the right size it would befun and I love the wording that he usesbecause he doesn't use like curvierwomen or if you have bigger thighs roughif you use the word rough right it'sabout the rubbing through the thighs andhow much pressure there is such a dickyour thighs are too rough don't you getit but you know look this is somethingwe talked about you know you make itmore exclusive and the bigger dick theirCEO is apparently yeah the more peoplethink like oh then I know I'm attractiveenough for your yeah so let me jump in Iagree with him to some extentcontroversy provost on The Young Turknow I I did a video on my own vlog aboutLululemon I don't agree with spending ahundred dollars on yoga pants I thinkit's stupidsorry I'm sorry and I it's a perfectexample of how paying more for somethingdoesn't necessarily mean you're gonnaget better quality I mean they're stillhaving issues with the Sheerness oftheir yoga pants and I believe thattheir yoga pants are gonna be sheerregardless of what your body size isokay so let me just get that out of theway with that said there are plenty ofpeople that wear yoga pants on a regularbasis that shouldn'twearing yoga pants they aren't the mostflattering thing on the planetoh well yeah that happens yeah that'snot particularly Lululemon and what adick this he oh no no I get that I getthat are you saying today if you stretchit out they are more sure of course yesokay so then you're backing him on thatokay if you're wearing yoga pants thatare too small for you and you stand ofcourse they're they're made out ofspandex so the more they stretch yeah Imean that's common sense but ironicallythe less you want to see through yeahI'm sure I didn't understand a word ofthis story I didn't know what I did I'venever heard of Lululemon and I like howthey refer to other stories as if theywere big stories that everyone got likeyou remember the controversy with the$98 yoga pants and I'm like no becauseyou're a man I know something aboutwomen's clothes but this I'd missed yeahI don't know chip Wilson I don't know alittle 11 I didn't know that I like youtell me the yoga pants cost $98 okay I'msure they're cheaper ones right yeah Igot your target is 20 bucks right yogapants but these ones probably you look alittle better yeah people have beenbrainwashed into thinking it makes theirasses look better right sorry I'm notreally outraged by what he said becausehe's justI mean he's either hurting his ownbusiness or double cycle fake outhelping his business by making it seemonly exclusive and that if you look ifyou if you're not overweight then youhave to have these pants even if youcan't afford them yeah like it might bea little bit genius he said somethingeight years ago that I thought wasreally questionable can I read you thatquote he says he was talking about thework ethic in China and he says 95% ofthe factories I've seen in the Orientare far better than far better than theones in North America in China manypeople come from the western provincesand their goal is to work seven days aweek 16 hours a day because in fiveyears they want to have a pile of moneyto go home with and start a businessyeah that's just that was way moreoffensive than what he had to say aboutwomen's Berkeley it's okay to say oryou just can't say oriental yeah theseare all goofy things I know it's just itsays it and yeah it's like the samething with the see-through yoga pantsright sheesh don't call people fat evenif it's true that if you're larger it'smore shared don't say it because youseems like you're being a douche andperhaps on purpose and on the Chinese alot of that is not super voluntary Iknow yeah seven days a week in 16 hoursthat's one of the barbwire points inwords in the factories right right andremember we're Mitt Romney the barbedwires so that people don't come into thefactories because they're dying to workat these great great places yes and bythe way in five years they don't have apile of cash to start their own businessyeah start their own business 16 hours aday seven days a week at $1 an hour youknow so this is just so blatantly it's aguy justifying the shitty conditions andthe

hi everyone i'm sarah moncriefa lou lemon ambassador in toronto canadai'm going to do some tips on beginningyogaand i taught a beginner's yoga workshopfor yearsand some of the things that i foundreally fundamental and foundationalabout the practice that we're going todo todayreally help with confidence and feelingcomfortable going into a level one classa beginner yoga workshop or any sort ofyoga class that you're looking forwardto enrolling inso what we're going to need today forthis practiceis a mat if you have one a pillow to siton for while we're in seated posturesand anything else that will make youfeel comfortable but honestly we don'treally need much it's very beginnerfriendlywe're going to start with the breath thebreath is something that we're doingevery single moment it's very automaticso bringing some consciousness tobreathing helps you to kind of go intoyourselfand calm yourself down relieve stress orjust bring out some overall happiness orjoy to your lifejust through the simple act of beingconscious with your breathso bringing your pillow to go underneathyour headyou can keep your knees bent or yourlegs straightyou're going to bring your hands to theoutsides of your ribsand as you inhale you're going to inhalethrough your nose but i want you tofocus on pushing away into your palm soyou're expanding your ribcage outinhalingand then exhaling nice and gentle likeyou're just blowing through a strawthrough your noseinhale expand your ribsexhale just release through your nosetaking three more of those with youreyes closed to just see how it feelsand then rolling over onto one sideand we're going to come back into aseated positionif you want to you can just use yourpillow back underneath youand the next breathing exercise we'regoing to do is a little more common tovinyasa yoga which is also the mostpopular style of yoga right nowso it's called jai breathing which isan ocean sounding breath so what'sreally helpful about this style ofbreathingis that not only are you actually doingthe movement of breathingyou can also hear the sound of it so ithelps you to cuebecause as you start getting a littlebit more familiar withyoga practices you'll notice thatthere's a whole set ofposes that go really well with inhalesand some that go along withexhales a little bit better so havingthat auditorycue is really amazing so you really wantthis breath to be loudyou want it to inspire the room aroundyou if you are practicing with otherpeople and you want it to inspireyourselfwhen you're doing it with yourself soi'm gonnagive you a little preview of what itsounds like and then we can break downdifferent ways that you can think aboutit to do it in your own bodyso inhaling firstexhalenice and loud inhaleexhaleso hopefully you can get a little bit ofwhat it sounds like and why it's calledthe ocean sounding wrathor my favorite is if you think aboutsucking like a triple thick milkshake upa thin strawyou're constricting at the throat to getas much as you canair through in a tight spaceand then exhale through that same thinstrawinhaleexhaleand the other cue that sometimes isreally helpful for people is if youthink of you have like a pocket hereright in front of youon the exhale you're trying to fog it upas much as possibleso inhalingexhale fog up the mirrorwe're just going to place that breathboth the breath that we were doinglaying on our backs and thebreathing to the side for a second andtalk aboutthe foundation of your body so we'regoing to practice thisin tabletop positionand pressing down through your hands andi want you to spread your fingers aswide as possible so you getas big of a surface area as possiblewhat this doesis it actually distributes the weightmore evenly throughoutall the fingers and takes pressure offof your wrist which is something forbeginner yogapeople who are doing beginner yoga ittends to be something where their wristsreally hurtso this helps spread your fingers niceand wide pressdown through your palms and with yourfeet this is also really importantyou want to press through the tops ofthe feet so it gives you a lift in yourbodyand also pressing down through yourknees anywhere that's touching the floorhelps with that too so my core is niceand engagedmy spine is nice and longand my legs are engaged my arms areengagedso that means that i can now practicesome movement herelinking my breath so we're going tostart with just that easy inhale andexhale through the nosenot the ujjai breathing so as you inhalei want you to drop your stomach downtowards the groundgaze comes up towards the ceiling andthenexhale nice and lightly through yournose roundforward looking towards your centernoticing if you're losing as you flowinhale look up where your feet arepressing downexhale around forward staying reallypresent with yourforearm and your foundationand then just coming up to a nice flatbackwe're going to practice this also indownward facing dogso you're going to press through thepalmscurl the toes under and start tostraighten the leg butuse your hands to push you back tostraighten your legs your hips are goingback in space up towards the ceilingand you're going to straighten throughyour legs keeping your feet hip distanceapartso for most of you or some of you youmay not be able to straighten your legsentirely that's okaykeep that up and in the knees the mostimportant thing here is that you relaxyour neckthe crown of the head gets nice and longand your entire spine justlengthens here so from the crown of theheadback towards the sacrum you're pushingthrough the palmsgetting as much length as possible andthenas you exhale you might be able tostraighten your legs a little bit morethan you would normallyso let's just practice that fujaibreathing hereinhaleexhaleinhaleexhaleinhaleexhaleand really slowly start walking yourfeettowards your hands and if you need toyou can walk your hands towards yourfeet we're just going to practice aslightforward fold here so bending andhinging at the hips almost like there'sdials on the hipshinging as much forward as possiblebringing again the crown of the headdown towards the flooryour feet are grounded hereholding on to opposite elbows juststretching yourself down towards thefloorchest comes towards your legsand again most important thing justrelax the neckand then slightly bending through yourkneesi want you to roll up to standing thinkaboutvertebrae stacking on top of vertebraestacking on top of vertebraereal slow coming all the way upto a standing position andeven though it may seem like we're juststanding this is calledmountain pose it's tadasana so it'sreally importantactually one of the most important foryour day-to-day life since we do do alot of standingso feet again hip distance aparti want you to lift your toes up off ofthe matgrounding down through the balls of yourfeet and your heelstrying to create equal pressure betweeneither sideand then just lowering your toes downhands come down by your sidesand just in each finger there's energythat comes out of those fingers and thatintentionalityof really reaching through the fingersis importantto having each part of your body beengagedand a part of the practice so spreadingyour fingersjust to get that to start to get yourbrain thinkingto stretch through spread your fingersroot down through your feet keep aslight bend in your knees this isactually really important becauseif you're like myself you'll have atendency tohyper extend the knees which meansthey're going back in space andlocking where now there's all thispressure on my kneerather than keeping a slight bend whichengages the rest of your body yourquads will naturally start to fire upand not like a deep back it's justa slight softness and your glutes willfire up as well your core will engageyour shoulders relaxed crown of the headreaches up towards the ceilingalmost like there's like a little strainjust reaching it up as much as you cangetting length feeling proud with yourchestand now we're going to do the ujjayibreathing moving the hands up towardsthe ceiling your gaze will come uptowards the thumband then exhale come back down now onething i wanted to mention about theujjayi breath is that it's a heatingbreathso for people who love saunas they loveexternal heat in a yoga practicethat you've tried before or a steam roomit's like this actually ujjai createsthis internal heat whichlengthens your muscles and opens yourconnective tissue and your layers offasciaso it's really important that youlink that breath with movement and thatit lengthens your bodyin the process so we're going to inhalereaching your arms upexhalehands come down to the sides inhalereach upexhale hands come back downinhale reach upexhale come downand you can continue to practice thatjust like you did in downward dogas much as you want to we're going tocome back into seated positionand i wanted to touch on one thingabout what you'll commonly find in theyoga practicewhich is most teachers and their yogapractice with the word namastejust to demystify the whole thingnamaste is a greetingit's like hello it's recognizing thelight within merecognizes the light within you anddon't feel uncomfortableto express that beautiful passage at theend of practiceso from my heart to yours namastethank you so much for doing thesebeginner yoga principles with me and ifyou have any questionsplease reach out and let me knowotherwisejust practice your breath practice thosepositiondownward facing dog and mountain posebecause they're so important andfoundational to any yoga practiceso again thank you so so much forjoining meand i hope to see you soonyou,22,UCY3_f-t8VBYh9rq8iHS-kdg,AbbyBReviewing,4,1,0,14,No

today we're going to have a look at thelululemon shorts how comfortable theyare how durable they areand are they worth the price coming uphi my name is sam and with me i haveseveral shorts from lululemon which i'vepurchased over the last few monthsso i'm the type of guy who has a greatappreciation for aesthetics and clothingbut i also gravitate towards pieces andbrands that are comfortable andfunctionalfor me fashion alone doesn't cut it iwant to wear something to look good butalso feel goodand lululemon in my opinion does itexceptionally wellthe shorts we will be having a look attoday are the surge six inch shortwith liner the surge short six inchliner specialas well as two pairs of the all terrainshorts also before we hop right infor your guys reference i stand at aboutfive foot eight uh 160 poundsand typically when i buy my bottoms iwear a size 30so in lululemon i decided to go with thesize small for all of these shortsso first up we have the search short sixinch linerin the variegated mesh camel black whatinitially drew me to these shorts wasthe pattern of the fabricas well as i'm a big fan of darker tonesespecially camouflagethe material on these is incredible andyou quickly realize as soon as you touchthemthey're buttery smooth and featurefour-way stretch meaning that they'reincredibly comfortable to wear all daylong[Music]the features on the short include astashable waistband loopa zipperless back pocket as well as atowel lube for those extra sweatyworkoutsbut not only that they also featurereflective detailing along with thelineras well as their famous logo embossedalso on the reflective materialnow these are the version with thebuilt-in liner which acts as acompression short built right into thefabricbut i'm a little bit conflicted on thispart on one hand they're made to be wornwithout underwear and trust me when isay that while i wear these to the gymi've never been any more comfortablehowever i'm also the type of guy whoenjoys wearing my little lemon gear asathleisure as wellmeaning i take my dog for walks in themgo to the grocery storeand also just hang out with friends thefact that they also have a built-inliner means no underwearand no underwear typically means meaninghaving to wash them after each and everyusei don't know about you guys but itypically wear my shorts at least ahandful of times before finding the needto watch themso for that reason unfortunately getabout only one use out of them before ihave to watch them again which is toobad because honestly these look reallygood and i just want to wear them overand over againdespite my struggles with the linermodel i still highly recommend theseshorts for not only the fit function andcomfort but also due to the pattern andthe design of the shorts i think they'rereally well thought out now i'm going toshow you a couple of ways i like to wearmine during my workoutsi typically pair these shorts with along sleeve or short sleeve sleevelessshirt in a monochromatic fashionor by adding a bit of color up top withmy go-to runnerswhile these shorts were made for runningand athletes in mind i also tend to wearthem out more casuallyand i typically do this by wearing themwith some sneakers a split hem t-shirtand an oversized hoodie[Music]are you enjoying this review of thelululemon's men's shorts so far makesure to like this video and leave acomment and let me know what otherlittle lemon items you would like me toreview in the futurenow up next we have the search short sixinch liner special while these soundalmost identical to the last choice wejust talked aboutthey do feature several uniquedifferences first off and most notablethe difference is the heavier reflectivepatternfound all along the shorts i honestlydon't mind these as these shorts aremore specifically for running and bikingandextra visibility factor does go a longway but the second most noticeabledifferenceis the feel of the material itself itunfortunately doesn't feel as soft tothe touchbut does feel quite sturdier to survivegetting caught on some bushes duringyour trail run other than thatthey feature the same stashablewaistband loops zipperless pockets inthe backbut in addition they also feature asmall zipper pocket which is perfect foryour gym cardsome coins or your keys just note thoughthat these pockets will not be able tohold any more than thatwhich is one of the unfortunate thingsabout all of these athletic shorts thatlululemon sells now the built-in linerfor these shorts are quite a bit longerso just note that if you do decide tobuy these that the liner will be aboutnine inches compared to the previousshorts we just talked about if i had achoice to buy these again i'd honestlyopt in for one of their other shorts anda linerless modelas i'm noticing that i prefer that typeof short just in general if you'reconsidering buying these i'd recommendhaving a look at the regular shortshorts insteadas they do feel a little bit morecomfortable and the liner feels a littlebit nicer as well when it comes tostylizing them i typically go about itthe same way as a sewage short sixinch regular pairing it with a workoutlong sleeve and the same runners[Music]in addition i do find myself runningerrands in them and you can find mewearing them with a more heavy cottontophigh rise socks and a sneaker and hat[Music]sobut not least we have my most recentshort pickup from lululemon which arethe all-terrain shorts in the seven inchlengthand i have to say these are my go-to'son a day-to-day basis unlike the searchmodel we just talked about earlierthese shorts feature no lining as wellas several additional storage pocketswhich we'll get into in a second nowthese shorts were also developed withrunners in mindbut i don't feel guilty for wearing themon a daily basis whether i'm walking mydogriding my bike in the city or justlounging around in my apartmentthe feel of the material is somewhere inbetween the surgeand the search special so they're notquite as soft as a surge but they'redefinitely a lot softer than the sergespecial they feature ventilation holesall around for additional breathingmeaning that if you're using them in thegym or for running or for biking thesewill be very breathablein terms of storage options we have onezipper pocket similar in size andlocation as a search specialas well as a mesh pocket on the sidewhich is technically meant for your gelsbut i definitely also use it to stash mykeys or loose chainthe back side also features a biggermesh pocket which is perfect for storingmy phoneother than that we have the samestashable waistband and reflectiveaccents all aroundbut i will say that the all-terrainshorts seem to be the most durable ofthe bunch as you can see from the doubleenforced seams the shorts also featurethe number 1818which is really cool because itrepresents lululemon's first head officeaddress in vancouver bc so as you cantelli actually have two pairs of these as ifound them on the sales section on theirwebsitewhen it comes to these shorts i'd saythey're totally worth the moneyespecially if you're a trailer runnerand you need some shorts which would bemore durable than the regular lineup iwill show you how i would typicallystyle these for the gymand for some more casual use as well[Music]so there you have it i've given you mythoughts and review on some of thelemon shorts for men so if you enjoyedthis video make sure to like andsubscribe and please leave a commentletting me know which one you would likeme to review nexti have quite a few other pieces fromlittle

i'm pretty impressed honestly thefabrics look basically identical thattheir softnessis on par with the lines i don't throwaround the term a line dupelightly from afar people would thinkyou're wearing lululemonso today we're going to be talking aboutwhat might be the most hyped lululemonalign legging dupes that i've ever heardi've heard claims these are exactly likethe lululemon linesor better which i am always skepticalabout because let's not makehasty claims here i'm gonna put up a fewlittle reviewsfrom my facebook group but people have alot of great things to say about theseso enough to make me realize that okay ihave to try theseso these are the hawthorne leggings fromamazon they're 25i got a size small and a medium this isthe small this is the mediumand i have not tried these on oranything yet so we're doing some firstimpressions today and to compare iactually have a real pair of lululemonalign leggingsand they just happen to be the exactsame colorthese are six i also have a four inlululemon lines which i think might fitme a little bit betterbut aligns are like kind of forgiving insizing in my opinion so i'll comparethese directly toreal lines so without further ado let'sstart talking about theseso these are the hawthorne athleticessential full-lengthworkout pants i don't know they alwayshave a lot of words and their titles onamazon likings pintobringing me the spring to play with meokayso these are 25.99 with amazon prime andi must say their logoand their tag looks very similar tolululemon here's their tag and thislittle redh logo very similar to lulu and even thebackthis is like exactly how lou lemon alsostructures their little tagsso they know what they're trying to dothese are trying to bealigned so before i do a side by sidewith the alliance i'm just going to talkabout the detailsso they do have a seamless waistband atthe top which you can't be in a linedupewith a seam at the top of your waistbandin my opinion they have that littlesilvery logo in the back that's meant tolook exactly like lululemon as wellthis waistband seems to be a doublethickness i forget if the lulus are thatway as wellbut they have one of those littleinternal pockets lulu's also have thatand these are 28 inch my lulu's are 25inch so they're not going to bethe exact same length so keep that inmind and they also have a gusset crotchso i will say when i took these out ofthe packaging the feel of theseexternallydoes feel like the closest thing i havefelt to the lululemon nulu fabricvery very soft and very brushed sohere's a close-up of the fabricit looks very similar to the lululemonit is very brushed almost kind of pillproneas a lines are but super super softso they're getting me there but i willsay these do feel slightly morestructured than the aligns i'm gonna seeif i can likeactually see a difference i don't knowif you can tell but i'm kind of likeholding them up in a similar wayin the hawthorns just have a little morelike structure to them like they'reforming a more like solid creaseand the actual lulus are just kind ofdraping these really have zero structureto them at allzero compression very very lightweight ifeel like these might have a little morestructure to them but i've never founda line dupe that is quite as thin aslululemonsso this might be the closest thing stillbut we'll try it so these are a mediumand normally i'm a size smallso i might do the try on of these or imight do a try on of the blue onesdepending on what fits betterso so first we'll do a side by sidecomparison with the alignsand then we'll do a little try on areyou serious i put down the leggings andlook who thinks it's for him hey go playwith your toysyou have so many toys get off theleggings oh my gosh oh pintooh my gosh those are expensive all rightso here are both of these sage graycolorsthese are the hawthorns and these arethe lululemon linesso let's get to comparison so i thinkone of the biggest things that i noticedeven while trying them on is that theseam color on the alignsmatches the color of the leggings a lotbetter the hawthorns just have this kindof likedark contrasting color which i thinklooks a little cheaper in my opinionjust because it doesn't really quiteblend in with actual leggings and i alsofeel like it kind of makes this frontseam stand out whichcan lead to consequences you know i'msaying but i think the waistbands lookvery similar they are both doublethickness but the hawthorne fabric isjust a lot thicker sothe double thickness feels like eventhicker but the waistbands aredefinitely comparable in heightand everything else looks prettycomparable okay so here's a fabricclose-upand honestly the fabrics look basicallyidentical like these have been washedquite a few times but my lulu's alwayshold up really welland these are the hawthorns and i don'tknow guys they're looking pretty similarthey both have a little extended crotchgusset not quite as obvious on the linesbecause they don't have this likecontrast stitchingand the lines are shorter because theseare 25 inch and these are 28 inchokay so here is the back in the logosare honestly very comparable like fromafar peoplewould think you're wearing lululemonsi'd say that the waistband stitchinghereis very similar it has a kind of aslight upward trendbut i would definitely not say it's likecurved but againmuch more noticeable on these becausethey're contrast stitching just anothernote this is a sixin a little lemon a line in the blue isa size small in the hawthornsand the six and the alliance issignificantly smaller soi do feel like the hawthorns could run atad bit bigsince you guys have been missing peachlately in my videos here she ishiding under the chair peachokay quickly hopping on to say that i'mgonna be trying on the small because themedium is just a little bit big in thewaist but actually it fits pretty wellelsewhere so loving the waist let's tryon the smallokay to be honest guys i'm prettyimpressed i will just say these are notexact lululemon align dupes but ifyou're new to this channel i don't throwaround the term a line dupelightly i'm very specific about it but iwould genuinely call thesea lululemon line dupe so let's talkabout them i'm pretty impressedso first of all these are incrediblybuttery soft like literallyso soft i would say that their softnessis on par with the linesbut i would give them more of a light tomedium compression rather than a lightcompression like a linesi do feel like i'm being held in alittle more which honestlycould be a benefit i feel like not everybody type really reaches for an alignedlegging becausethey aren't very forgiving so i do feellike these are offering a little moremore hold with this amount of softnessthough i do feel like you coulddefinitely get some pillingso definitely something you should becareful of they do also collect like catfurand lint and all that so don't sit downwith your cats with these so no tomyselfthis is the size small it definitelyfits me better but with the aligns ifeel like the waistbandalways just sits so comfortably on mywaistand they never slide down or anythingthey just fit perfectly with thesei don't know if you can tell this is asize small that's my normal sizeand they just have a little bit of extraroom in the waist it's actually notflush to my waisti'm not sure i could really size down inthis case becausei just feel like they might be a littletoo small but if you're in between iwould go with the size downthey are actually really stretchy soprobably could play with the sizing alittle bitthey also do just generally feel alittle bit heavier because the fabric isa little more thick a little morestructuredi feel like they're staying up prettywell to be honestbut i don't think they're as weightlessas the lines i'm not feeling the sameexact like naked feelother than the waistband i don't haveany extra fabric anywhereno extra fabric here no extra fabric inthe back so i do feel likeoverall the sizing is pretty good i'malso not feeling like it's overly tightanywhere they are solid high rise up tomy belly buttoni will say with these so i'm not gettingany camel pintobut with the lines usually you can pullthem up a lot and camel's really not anissuebut with these i did try to pull them upa little bit extra in the front seamwas a little invasive so the 28 inch isa full length on methis fabric is not going to be entirelysweat proof i do feel like you'll get alittle more cellulite coverage on thesethan the aligns so i would actually saythat these might be pretty cellulitefriendlyum the lines i don't think are cellulitefriendly but these aren't celluliteproofi do feel like these little glute seamscould be up a little bit higher like isaid i tried to pull them upand then we get some consequences in thefront so this is kind of where they needto bebut that being said i would still givethem a solid medium to highon the booty scale because i do feellike they're pretty enhanced i don'tknow i'm not being squished downit's really hugging every little area sohonestly these are really great they'realso super stretchy and don't restrictmy movements at alllike you can do any sort of stretchingand there's not an issue so there's notightness anywherethey're definitely a good yoga legginggood lugging for stretchingso are they exactly like lululemon nobut i do think they're really closeand probably the best dupe you can getfor 25 okay so these are the real alignsand even in the size 6 which is kind ofequivalent to a medium the waistband iscompletelyhugging my waist like there's no gapinglike the hawthorns didand these just feel totally weightlessvery light compressionbut they almost like never fall down onme because they're just so weightlessand hug me in every way so hawthorne'snot exact but very closeto these og alignsall right guys so that is it for thereview definitely solid dupebut not exact and i know i'm going toget questions about if i like thesebetter than colorful koalaand i still think i would have to say nobecause i really love how colorfulkoalas fabrics really last me a longtime i can't speak to the longevity ofthe hawthornsand the colorful koala stitching isn'tlike as contrast and i just don't reallylove the contrast stitchingi'd say the colorful koala like brushedleggings are very similar in feel tothesemaybe slightly less like a line butterysoft but definitely still very soft andcolorful koalas i would give a solidmedium compression the hawthorns i feltlike were more a light to medium soyou're going to get a little morecompression other colorful koalas andyeah i'd say it's up to personalpreferenceboth very good leggings if you enjoyedthis video please give it a thumbs upand

this is actually one of my favoriteproducts from Lululemon as much it isjust a t-shirt it's just not a t-shirtwhen you train in it so I'm gonna get tothis product and you let you guys know alittle more detail on how it fits andwhat it's all aboutlet's get into it what's going on guyswelcome back to our kwaini direction ofmodern man my name is mr. lu today ihave a new product for you guys it is byLululemon yet again this is wearing alemon rampage right now so when it comeson lemon I do have a five-year basic teathis is actually one of my favoriteproducts from Lululemon as much it isjust a t-shirt it's just not a t-shirtwhen you train in it this actually is astandalone top selling product from Glulemon for something just as a basict-shirt I'm surprised it's so popular atmass scale and so with this product thisactually is a large so for me I'm sixfoot I have let it build slim fit sowhen it comes on this product right herethis is in a large and this actuallyfits me quite well and this actually hasa nice drop on my waist so so you guyslooking for your right size to do toadvise you guys to go to the store andcheck it outso for me Alijah should seem best so oneof the big reasons why I bought thisshirt was because I never had a littlelemon shirt before and I always wantedto see what it was about see what thehike was about so when I bought thisshirt this was something that I wantedto have in a neutral tone so I got inthe light actually great so this isactually perfect for me because I do owna pair of black Lululemon pants this isa soft lightweight crew it's pretty forany condition of the day so you can wearthis under undershirt you can just wearthis as a chill Sunday look you can oryou can just wear it as a working outtype of Luckies wall and as it does fiton the body it does look really reallynice as a t-shirt but also not onlythinking that as a t-shirt but it'sactually a workout piece to workout inso what it does come down to the sweatprotection of this from me sweating fromit and haven't experienced this t-shirtnumerous occasions working now I'll saythe sweat protection on this is quitewell obviously wear deodorant but as yousweat through this you don't have a lotof odor build-up within this becauseit's actuallybreathable if you guys looking forsomething to step away from the typicalcotton t-shirt this is something whereit's actually smooth on the skin you'llbe very very pleased with the productand you guys would be very happy withnot only purchasing one but maybepurchasing another down the road a coolthing about this product is it's notjust a standard t-shirt or a standardworkout gear by Lululemon on thebackdrop of this t-shirt actually has alittle scoop at the back so it comes alittle lower at the back than the frontthat shows a little bit of an identityfeature within the product and when itcomes down to the sleeves they are slimfit and they are quite snug on theyaren't quite snug but also breathable onthe arms as well so which is why shecried nice so in terms of grabbing onthe backside of the t-shirt it does havethe embroidered Lululemon logo so it isvery faint but also minimalistic at thesame time so as main pro designed outfrom Vancouver which is my hometown so Ireally love supporting my own localcompanies out there but also this isactually a global company at this pointand seeing them blow up on a globalscale it says tremendous and I love thelifestyle and the lifestyle that isportrayed in Vancouver is more outdoorfriendly more relaxed vibes and that'sjust what that represents and that'sjust me as a person so supporting localsis always fun is always good to be thattype of ambassador for that so why aboutthis typically I bought this because Inever had a Lululemon shirt before so asa game to war my runs I want somethingthat will feel breathable butcomfortable and I feel stylish within itso I kind of leaned towards Lululemonfitted t-shirts I took a took a riskwith itI decided why not try what I have tolose and I was very pleased with theproduct so when it comes down to a pricepoint the price point of this shirt issix to eight dollars it's not this at-shirt it's a workout shirt so you canhave this for long term and can be usedon multiple occasions so trust me when Isay try the t-shirt out for first timeinvest in their product and you'll feelthe returns on investments long termyou'll be very pleased with the productor whatever representand how it will actually benefit yourlifestyle and your training but actuallyvery interesting when it comes down tothe psychology of clothes so when

hi everyone welcome back to my channeland welcometo the first true crime maker video of2021. expecta lot more true crime videos this yeari'm really going to throw myself intotrue crime in 2021 so if you're new herehi please subscribe for a lot more truecrime content in 2021 and if you don'tknow what these videos are i'm basicallygoing to be doing my makeupwhilst talking about a true crime caseand all the products that i will beusing today will belisted in the description box so ithought we'd start the year witha crazy case i mean they're all crazyaren't they uh but this casetakes a very unexpected turn like i wasnotexpecting what happensand today's case is the case of thelululemon murder also known as the yogastore murderbecause it takes place in a lululemonstore and if you don't know whatlululemon isum it's quite a high workout clothingstore and they are particularly wellknown for their leggingsthey're very very expensive i've neverpurchased anything from them myselfum and i just went onto the websitewhile i was doing my research for thiscase just out of curiosity i wanted tosee because i didn't know how expensivei just knew they were expensivei i couldn't believe the prices so i cankind of wrap my head aroundexpensive leggings because leggings areso difficult like to get a comfortablepairthat are really comfortable that aretight they're not too tight they kind ofsuck you in where you want to i can kindof wrap my head around expensiveleggingsbut they had a pair of basic greyjoggers for 110pounds there is nothing in the worldthat can convince methat joggers are worth 110 poundsso hopefully that gives you an idea oflululemonand this particular lululemon store waslocatedin bethesda maryland which is quite awealthy suburband is very popular with workers fromwashington dc because it's only like 10miles away so on saturday the 12th ofmarchrachel who is a manager lululemonarrives at workat the bethesda store she arrives around8amand when she arrives at the store thedoor is unlocked whichis obviously not normal so sheimmediately starts panicking i mean ithink we allwould and as she entered the store shewas shocked bythe chaos that was in front of her therewas clothes on the floormannequins had been knocked over therewas even a tv that had been likeripped off the wall and was smashed onthe floor so her mind immediately wenttooh my god we've had a breaking but thenshe saw bloodso she immediately rushes out of thestore and she comes acrossthis young man called ryan who wasoutside he was actually queueing outsidethe apple store which was locatednext door he was queuing because applehad released their ipad 2 when he was inline to get his ipad tooso ryan sees rachel rushing out of thisstoreand she's quite clearly distressed andhe goes over to her wants to know what'sgoing on ifanything's wrong and if he can help soafter rachel describes what she found inthe store to ryanhe offers to go into the store for herand check things out a little bitfurther even though i don't thinkpaul ryan at the time knew exactly whathe was going to come acrossso he enters the store veryapprehensively as you can imagineand he sees the chaos that rachel sawand he starts to make his way to theback of the storeand as he's moving towards the back ofthe store the situationis becoming more chaotic there is moreblood there is justmore things on the floor thrown aroundryan spotsa door right at the back of the storethat's kind of slightly ajarso he goes towards the door he wants tosee what's going on because it does looklike there's a lot of blood coming fromthis roomso he goes to push the door open and hecan't there is some resistance it's likesomething he's blocking the way so hepushes the door a little bit harder andthe door does openand he's absolutely horrified becausethe door was being blocked bya body and there was blood everywherethere was blood sprayedall of the walls there was blood allover the floorthe body was in a pool of blood therewas just somuch blood everywhere and the body hadsomany injuries ryan couldn't evenidentify whether the body was a male ora female at the time that's how extremethe injuries wereryan turns to leave the store however ashe does sohe kind of hears like a muffled groancoming fromone of the staff toilets he did go andcheck it out and i can't even imaginewhat he's going through his mind rightnow he must have been absolutelyterrified i mean he got up that saturdaymorningjust thought it was going to be a normalday i mean obviously they all did butryan just went to get his ipad toobut he went to the staff toilet and hecould seesome legs sticking out of the bathroomdoor and as he getscloser he finds a woman that is alsocovered in blood she has quite asubstantialinjury to her head her body is coveredwith like small cuts everywhere thecrotch area on her leggings had alsobeencompletely savagely removed and she wastied up with zip ties her hands and herfeet were like completely bound butthankfullyshe was still alive ryan could see thatshe was breathing so when the emergencyservices arrived the body that ryan cameacrossfirst the one that was just so badlyinjured he couldn't even identify themshe was identified as a woman whose namewas jaina murray and verytragically she was pronounced dead atthe scene now jaina murray was 30 yearsoldor should i say 30 years young she wassoincredibly young and she was justsomebody thateverybody loved she always had this hugesmile on her face she was always happyto haveshe just really lived life to the fullshe was very adventurous she traveledthe worldshe was definitely like an adrenalinejunkie she loves skydivingand rock climbing and bungee jumpingand at the time of her murder she wasactually studying for hermaster's degree at john hopkinsuniversity for business andcommunicationsand she actually studied lululemon as acompany as part of her degreebecause she just loved the ethos and thephilosophy behind the brand she lovedthat kind of way of lifeso one of her professors actuallyencouraged her to get a job at lululemonand that is how jaina ended up workingat the lululemon store she was alsoin a happy and loving relationship shehad known her boyfriendsince the seventh grade and what was soincredibly tragic is that he wasplanning on proposingso the other woman that was found at thescene the one that was in the bathroomwas also a lululemon employeeand she was identified as brittanynorwood and she was 28 years old andluckily like i saidshe was still alive she did survive thisbrutal attack and shewas rushed straight to hospital and shedid have onemajor injury to her head but veryluckilya lot of her other injuries were verysuperficial like the cuts all over herbody hadn't actually gone that deep sobecause herinjuries weren't that bad the policewere able to talk to herrelatively quickly and get an account ofwhat exactly happened in that store sobritney started by telling the policethat both her and jainawere on the late shift on friday the11th of march the night beforeand they closed up the store around 10p.mand jaina made her way home she got inher car to drive homeand brittany made her way home bywalking to the metro stationhowever when she was nearly at the metrostation she realized that shecould not find her metrocard anywhere soshe just assumed that she'd left itat work so she did phone jaina becausejaina was also a manager at the storeand she was the only one with keys soshe phoned jaina to see if she could lether in the lululemon store so she couldget her metro cards so she could go homewhich of course jaina did so when jainaarrived at the store she just left hercarparked outside of the store both her andbrittany went into the store they leftthe doorunlocked and they started looking forthe metro card but they couldn't find itand after 10 minutes or sojaina was just like britney have mymetro card we'll look for yours tomorrowit'sit's not a big deal however when theywent to leave the storetwo men appeared out of nowhere theywere dressed head to toe in black andthey were both wearing ski masksthe first man struck jaina which knockedher out and then the second manalso struck britney and grabbed her byher hairand dragged her to the back of the storebrittany tried toresist the man but he was veryaggressive he was usingvery aggressive violent language he wasusing a lot of racial slurs so the mandragged britney to the bathroom whereryan found her the next dayand he threw her on the ground and begancutting her all over her body and thenhecut open the crotch of her leggings andstarted to rape her and after hecontinued to sexually assault her witha wooden coat hanger whilst this attackwas happening on brittanybrittany could kind of hear what wasgoing on with jaina she could hear lotsof shouting and screaming and like thudsand as time went onbritney said that jaina's screams werejust getting quieter and quieteruntil they eventually just faded away atthis point britney did manage to getaway from herattacker and she tried to make her wayto jaina and while she was telling thepolice thisshe was crying uncontrollably whichobviously you can understandand she just kept repeating to thepolice there was so much bloodthere was so much blood that's what shejust kept repeating over and over topolice however she didn't really getto jaina she saw jaina but she didn'treally get to do anything she didn't getto help her in any way before herattackerknocked her down again dragged her backto the bathroomand this is when he tied her up with thezip ties britneywas quite clearly suffering withsurvivor's guiltshe was blaming herself for what hadhappened to jainashe just kept saying if i hadn't lost mymetro card if i hadn't asked jaina to goback to the storethis wouldn't have happened jaina was soinnocent it was at this point thatbritney asked how jaina was doing shedidn't even realize that jaina had diedan autopsy was carried out onjaina and it was discovered that jainahad sustained a totalof 303injuries there actually could have beenmore but that was just the amount thatthey could identify because some of theinjuries could have been layered andthey could only class that as one ifthat makes sense and based on theevidencefrom the crime scene and the injuriessustainedthese 331 injuries were made with atleastseven weapons which included a hammera wrench two box cutters a rope a littlemetal pig that was a part of a mannequinand what is extremelyjust absolutely horrific to hearis that jaina was alive for this entireattack she was fighting for her lifefor this whole attack and then the verylast injury was a stab wound to the backof her neck whichsevered her spinal cord which was thelastfatal blow and the way that they couldtell that jaina was alive throughoutthis whole attack is that all of theinjurieshad bruised in some kind of way or therewas bleedingand that could only have happened ifjaina's heart was still beating britneycouldn't give a very accuratedescription of the attackers becausethey were wearing ski masks the onlything she could really tell the policewas that one was very short and one wasvery tall there was onlyone clue really at the crime scene toeven giveany indication of who these attackerswere and that wasbloody footprints walked through thestore and they were a size 14.unfortunately lululemondidn't have any cctv whichi didn't realize was a thing like idon't know if it's just mebut i thought all stores had cctv insideand outsideum but i don't know if that's just methat thought that um butlululemon didn't have cctv inside oroutsideof the store however luckily they werenext door to an apple storewhich did have cctv so the police wentto apple to recover the tapes and on thefootagethey saw none other than two men dressedhead to toe in blackone tall one short walking past thelululemon storeat approximately the time of the attackhowever they couldn't seetheir faces from this footage so theycouldn't identify them so one detectivejust decided to do an old-fashionedstakeout to stake out the lululemonstore to see if the attackers wouldreturn to the sceneand miraculously right on schedule twomendressed in head to toe black one tallone short walked past the lululemonstorehowever after questioning these two menturned out to be completely innocentthey were actually waiters at a nearbylocal restaurant and they dressed in allblack because that was their uniformand they walked in that direction pastthe lululemon store because that wastheir way homeso with no leads the police returned tothe apple store because they also hadcctvcameras inside the store on the night ofthe murder from10 past 10 to 19 minutes past 10. it wasclear that the apple employees couldheara commotion coming from the lululemonstore i mean you can visibly see them onthe cctv footagewalking over to the wall so the policequestioned the employees working thatevening because they wanted to knowexactly what they could hear and if thatcould give them any leads as to whothese attackers were and the appleemployees just said that they could heara combination ofscreams strange thuds and hystericalvoices could make out twofemale voices one angrily shouted quotetalk to metell me what's going on why won't youtell me and then the other female voicesaying hysterically quote stop oh godplease help me god and then the policewere like okaytwo female voices what about themale voices which were the attackers buttheapple employees said there weren't anymale voices there was definitelyjust the two female voices and thepolice were so shockedand i am so shocked atwhy the apple employees didn'treport this commotion why didn't theytell anybodywhy didn't they phone the police whydidn't they tell the securitythat was at the apple store because theapple store always has securitywhy didn't they tell anybody and theapple employees just said that theythought it was just a little bit ofdramajust a little bit of drama so still withnoleads the police return to the crimescenethey look through everything again theywant to see if there is anything thatthey missedanything that could lead them to asuspect in any wayand this is when they start to look alittle bit more closelyat those set of bloody footprints thatwas walked through the store and theywere starting to get a little bitconfused aboutthese footprints and there was anotherset of footsteps as well and this wasfrom a smaller shoe sizeand the size 14 footsteps were alwayson top of the smaller set of footstepsthere wasno overlapping whatsoever which is whatyou would expectfrom a violent attack from the attackerand the victim going back and forth youwould expectsome overlapping but there wasn'twhich is very very strange and thena shocking discovery was made there wasa size14 pair of shoes inthe lululemon store and the print on thebottom of the shoematched identically to the bloodyfootstepson the floor the police returned tobrittany and they asked her aboutthese shoes they're like what's the dealwith these shoes because they were juston a shelf they were like why is thisrandom pair of shoes just on the shelfand britney said that they belong to thestore and they just keptsome pairs of shoes so customers couldtry on the leggings the workout gear andif they didn't have their own trainersthey could try on the store trainersso that is why those size 14 trainerswere justthere so now the police were getting alittle bit suspiciousthe crime scene was just not adding upit was not as it first seemedfirstly they realized that all of theweapons thatwere used in the attack all camefrom a toolbox that belonged tothe lululemon store the zip ties thatwere used on brittanywere also zip ties thatbelonged to the store it just seems verystrange that these twoattackers came to the lululemon storecompletely unprepared they didn't bringtheir own weaponsthey didn't bring anything like wouldn'tthey at least like have somethingon them the bloody footsteps as wellnever left the store another thing thatwas justextremely bizarre to the police was thedifferences between the injuries thatjaina had sustainedand britney brittany in comparison tojainahad come off relatively lightly as wellthe investigators were just a little bitconfused aboutthese attackers i mean they just seemedtooevil to be true i know it's notimpossible to get people that evil weall know those really infamousmurderers serial killers yes you can getpeople that evilbut it's rare and what's even more rareyes i know this happens as well but it'srare to gettwo people so evil that are just on theloose together so one detectivekind of had a little revelation that wasvery shockinghard to believe he didn't even want tobelieve it himself he said quote i don'tthink there were evertwo masked men in that store i thinkbritneykilled jaina remember when jana droveback to the store to help brittany lookfor her metrocard remember that she hadher car and she parked outside of thestorewell where was this car because the carwas not outside the storewell the car was actually found threeblocks away from the store and there wasblood foundall on the inside of the car and whenthe dnaresults came back it showed that theblood belonged to both jaina andbrittanyand it also indicated that only oneperson had beenin the car following the attack and thatperson was britney so the policequestioned brittany about the carand brittany claimed to not know whathad happened to the carand she also said that she had neverbeen in the carand obviously the police know that she'slying at this point but they don't haveany concrete evidence that britneykilled jaina at this point so they can'tarrest her howeverthey were amazed that britney actuallyoffered to come backinto the station and she said that shejust had a little bit more informationthat she wanted to get off her chestthere was something else that sheremembered so nowin another completely shocking twistbritney tells the police she wasin the car of the night of the murderand she wasn't justin the car she drove it she said thather attackers forced her to move the carbecause they didn't want the car outsidethe store because it might grabsome attention so they forced britney tomove the carand threatened to kill her if she didn'treturn back to the store so let's justget this straightfirstly britney doesn't remember beingin the carand now all of a sudden she was in thecarand she wasn't just in the car she drovethe car she drove the carthree blocks away and thenshe walked back to the storebritney could have at any point gottenaway she could have kept driving shecould have alerted anyone she evenpasseda police car when she was driving thiscar three blocks awayshe passed a police car yet she didn'tthink to tell them she didn't think tostopshe didn't think to keep driving shedidn't think to get help vaginai'm just like at this point i'm justlike what was going on in britney's headdid she truly believe that the policewere gonna believethis story that she was telling so atthis point the police just decided tocome clean to brittany and saylook we think you killed jaina and whenthe police say thisshe instantly clams up and justrepeatedly keeps sayingi want to go home i want to go home thepolice decided to bringbritney's brother into the room thinkingthat maybe he could helpmaybe he could help her confess so thepolice tell her brothereverything that they have afterinforming britney's brother ofeverything that the police have theyleave the roomthey say we'll give you a minute letbritney calm downlet her brother and brittany justprocess everything digest theinformation what they were secretlydoingwas leaving the room hoping that britneywould come clean to just her brotherthe first thing that britney asks herbrother are there any cameras in thisroom and her brother replies noi've checked so britney's brotherstraight away just comes out with itdid you do this with britney respondingquotei don't want to talk about it here tellme right nowdid you join i just want to talk aboutit here i meanif you were innocent your response wouldbe nomy brother was still pleading with herto tell him the truth tell him whathappenedwith brittany replying i don't wanteveryone to be disappointed in meit doesn't really sound like an innocentperson so i think at this point herbrother just assumes thatshe's guilty so he starts to say okay weneed to get you a good lawyer we need tosort out this messbrittany then breaks down and startscrying and says quote i'm sorry i don'tknow what to sayi didn't know what to do i honestly ithappenedi don't know what to do which yes shedidn'tactually say she did it i mean she kindof did she said i honestlypaused for a brief second and then saidit happenedwhich is basicallya confession you wouldn't say that ifyou hadn't done it they're in a policestationeven though britney and her brotherdidn't realize they were being recordedthey were and the police were actuallywatching all of thison a live stream so at this pointbecause that was basically a confessionthe police have enough evidence now toarrestbrittany norwood for the murder of jainamurray and what is sohorrendous is that jaina's family foundout about britney's arreston the way to jaina's funeral whattiming thatis the worst timing in the world andthey werenumb with shock because they had thoughtbritney had gone throughthis absolutely horrific attackwith their daughter they had so muchsympathy for brittany for goingthrough this for witnessing this andthen to find outthat she has been arrested for themurderwhen you thought that she was also avictim i can't even imaginewhat that would have done to jaina'sfamily there was a plea dealon the table and it was up to jaina'sfamily whether to push for this dealor to go to trial and try and get thefull sentenceof life without parole so remember thatjaina had sustained331separate injuries at least well theaverageviolent attack would consist normally ofaround50 separate injuries so there's a bit ofa difference here and alsothe attack on jaina would have lastedapproximately15 minutes which is actually a very verylong time when it comes to a violentattackso this wasn't a crime of passion thiswas a coldblooded murder and jaina's family didn'twant to riskhaving someone like this one day bereleasedand just be able to roam the streets sothey did go to trial which was a veryhard decision for the family becausethey would have to sit throughall of the evidence and all of thedetails and basically have to relivethe murder of their daughter but theywanted to do it because they didn't wantbritney to one day be released and atthe trial it came out that brittany hadquite a detailed criminal past she had alongand i mean a very long history ofstealingshe would steal from even her familyand her friends and shockingly britneyhadworked at a different lululemon storeand was caught stealing from that storewhich is why she lost her job therei don't know how she got another job tobe honest but she did she also had ahistory ofviolence she was quite abusive to herex-boyfriendwhen they were in a relationship and herex-boyfriend had to get a restrainingorder on her because she was stalkinghimand his new girlfriend and she brokethis restraining order within two weeksshe actually broke into herex-boyfriend's homeand stole some of his and his newgirlfriend's possessionsso again with the stealing so theprosecutors finally laid out the motiveof why they thought britney killed jainain the weeks leading up tojaina's murder the employees at thebethesdalululemon store were starting to noticethat their possessions were goingmissing and this had only startedhappening sincebritney had started to work at lululemonthere's a few other things as well thathappened at the lululemon storethat the employees were a little bitsuspicious of but they didn't have anyconcrete evidence that it was britneystealing their possessions so they allkind of agreedto just keep a lookout just to see justkeep an eye on brittany lululemon have apolicythat every staff member's bag must bechecked at the end of the dayi think that's quite common in retailjaina checked britney's bagon friday the 11th of march and shefound a pair of leggings that weren'tpaid foreven though britney said that she hadpaid for them jaina didn't trust britneybecause of the past behavior so she saidthat she would have to speak to themanager rachelthe next day it was at this point thatbritney started to panicshe knew that she was going to getcaught for stealing because she actuallydid steal those leggingsshe thought she was going to lose herjob again and she couldn't afford tolose another job so after leaving thestorethis is when she started to plan outwhat she was going to do how she wasgoing to lure jaina back to the storeand that whole i've lost my metro cardlittle storywas completely fake so as we knowbritney did manage to lure jaina back tothe storeand this is where brittany confrontsjaina do you remember the appleemployees that reported on what theycould hearfrom the commotion in lululemon do youremember that they said that one of thefemale voices was sayingtell me what's going on well i thinkfrom this we can assume that that wasbritney and she was confronting jainaabout what she was going to dowhat she was going to say to rachel andi think at this point she probably foundout that all of the employees were kindof on to her stealing and thisis very sadly when the brutal attack onjaina started so after she murderedjaina this is where britney started tocome up with the planon how she was exactly going to cover upthis murder she moved jana's carthree blocks away because she wasworried that the manager rachel wouldsee it because rachel lived across theroad from the store and if she had seenjana's carshe would have alerted the police ormaybe come over andinterrupted britney's little plan hethen returned to the storecreated the fake chaos throwing theclothes aroundtipping over the mannequins ripping idon't know how ripping the tv from thewall and then obviouslyher bloody footprints were all over thestoreand this is when she needed to make itlook like there was two male attackersin this storeso she put on the size 14 shoes thatwere in the storeand she walked over her bloodyfootprints with new fresh bloodyfootprints and that is why there was nooverlappingbecause brittany did them both that isalso why the footprintsnever left the store because britneynever left the store obviously otherthanmoving janna's car but she didn't leavethe store she then realizes that shealso needed to look like a victim ofthis attack so she takes out a knife andstarts cutting herselfall over her body as well as cuttingopen the crotch area of her leggingsremember she had a really serious headinjury that was the onlygenuine injury that she had and shesustained thatduring the attack on jaina she wasrepeatedly hitting jainaand with the force and the momentum andwhen she was pulling back fromrepeatedly hitting jaina she actuallyhitherself in the head she also got somepaper towelssoaked up some of jana's blood putjana's blood on herown body and put jana's blood all overthe floor in the bathroom to make itlook like it washer own blood she then got some zip tiestied up her feet tied up her hands thatshe did with her teethand then raised her hands above her headand stayed in that positionuntil somebody found her which of courseryan didafter hearing all of this it only tookthe jury minutesto decide that britney was guiltybritney was found guilty of premeditatedfirst degree murder and was sentenced tolife imprisonment without parole andthat is the case of the lululemon murderwhich issuch a horrific horribletragic twisted it's horrible there was areally good book that i read when i

in a review an overview of Lululemon andI wanted to talk to you guys about mycollection and some of the items that Ihave got off with pants and these are ahuge thing of pants errors of ourpurchase from Lululemon so this is whatstarted this whole tragedy of my bankaccount so this is the groove pant and Iactually wore this on my how to loseweight video which went viral this istheir most famous pant that they have itis just I think it's the most famous itis what they're known for they'rebasically like a yoga pant that has alittle bit of a flare on the bottom theyhave a larger flare than the astralpants and I'm just gonna say that thesepants just make anybody look amazingthey give your butt an instant but leftI don't know what it is I think it'sbecause the way that the waistband iscut it kind of cuts here and so it cutslike the button half so it makes thebutt look a little bit tighter and thenthey high like these little seams whereit just kind of emphasizes like thewhole butt like where you have seamsright where your tightest part of yourbutt is it just kind of pusheseverything up and then the seams go allthe way down to the bottom of the legthe pants usually have this Lululemonsymbol on the sides of them and theLululemon symbol was actually came fromthe letter A from one of the names thatthey were going to name the companythere were named Lulu Lemon athleticclay hip or something so this was kindof a stylized a for it which i think isso funny because it's so iconic thisLululemon symbol I've had these pantsfor four years and I've probably haveworn this this article clothing more inmy clothing collection that I have anyother clothing item that I ever have Ithink I think I can safely say thatpeople think Lululemon is expensive butif you divide the number of times thethe price of the clothing divided by thenumber of times you wear I find thatthat number is smaller and then anythingelse on my knee collection my clothingitem collection like you can get a dressat forever 21 but sometimes you'll wearit oncenever gonna wear it and then you get youknow yoga pants from Lululemon andyou'll wear like 300 times 400 times 500times whatever now I will say that thisquality is not very like again thepilling there's like pilling city on thepant it's just pilling so much butwhat's also great about like theirgroove pants is that they are reverselined of vertically a stretchedwaistband and you can just see how muchpilling there is around the crotch areaI mean this just goes to show you howoften I wear these and I still wear themit's like the perfect pant - we're goinggrocery shopping or even like you knowlike on a flight or whatever because itjust it's just so comfy and I also weara lot of my Lululemon to sleep so I havethese grooves and then I haven't alsoanother pair of groove pants where Icannot find where the heck they are butthey have like a pink waistband and yeahthese are the grooves and then I haveanother pair of grooves which I don'treally wear that often because they'rekind of short so the inseam of Lululemonis 31 I think and I'm not that tall I'mlike about five five so I find that someof Lululemon's items are a little bit onthe shorter side so if you're not surejust go with the tall if you're likeabove five five or five six go with thetall and just get them hemmed at thestore because they do offer freealterations I got these this is likevery very generic Lululemon it's justthe groove pant they are kind of shortwhich is why I don't wear them thatoften but again they have a lot ofpilling in the back because they're kindof old and they have the Lululemon logoright here and then they reverse to ablock black side and then they also andevery single in their pants they have acoin pocket here with a pair of Lulu's Ihave is this pant it is called the barpulse pant I liked it I liked it becauseit just I just really liked the patternof it it's kind of fun I like pants thatare really have a lot of stuff going onso it's heather blue and this brightblue here the waistband is nice it'sreally comfortable it's a pretty longand the logo is a really really heart tosee black Lululemon insignia so I wishthey had like more apparent one I don'tknow just because if you're paying forpants that are so expensive you wantthem to be shown but whatever itsfavorite pants at the moment they arethe Lululemon estill pants and they havethem on sale so you might still be ableto grab a pair on the we made too muchsection this is so so so comfy these arelike the clothing items that you wearwhen you need to go grocery shopping andget some milk and eggs you know so therethis one is made out of luan full-onluan which is like what their fat whatthey're known for it's this kind offabric that's very very it's almost likeSpanx see fabric like like pantyhosefabric like really thick pantyhosefabric that kind of sucks everything inthat's kind of what Lululemon it andthey're so so comfortable you know I'mgonna be wearing these as much as thosegroove ones that I have here these cropsthese are I don't really like to wearcops because I don't like to shave mylegs but these are the gather and growcrop these are pretty famous forLululemon they're kind of like a littlebit of a flare to them this one has areversible waistband so it is striped onone side and then purple on the other Ilove how the waistband is super superthick and the waistband is just tightall over so if you buy Lululemon on eBayyou have to be really careful becausethere's a lot of fake Lululemon and onetime I did buy a fake Lululemon andtheir waistband had like like a rubberband across the top but it wasn't tightit was like fabric and then rubber bandsthere so you know that that's fake butLululemon is just kind of tight all overand then on the bottom I mean I've beenwearing these forever and they have lotsof pilling along the crotch area butthey have like little cutout flares herewhich is niceand also what I do like about Lululemonis that a lot of their bottoms arereversible so they usually have a tagthere they here that you can just cutoutis a pair of crops that I actuallyrecently got on Poshmark and they arelike scrunched crops these are okaythey're actually not that amazing to behonest you know they have the Lululemona Signia but they don't really have likethe the stripes or the seams that gobetween your butt so I think this is anolder style and here is probably myfavorite one of my favorite crops theseare I don't know what these are calledthey have them on the website right nowso they are still selling them butthey're the most like tight-ass likethey're like basically like pantyhoselike really tight Spanx pantyhose thewaistband is so so tight and stretchy soit'll cover up everything smootheverything out no muffin top and theback is amazing because the back almostsounds like the Lululemon insignia hereI don't know if you can tell but it haslike the little a shape here and theyhave like little seems like scrunchedseams I really like these I highlyrecommend people getting these like thethings that I recommend is the groovepant that's still pant and these cropsreally nice and they come in like babyblue and gray and this is a navy colorso these are really great workout pantspairs of the wonder under that I got butI think I might bring them back becausethey're a little bit I don't knowthey're not as flattering as I wouldhave thought the wonder unders is reallywhat put Lululemon on the map that and Ithink the groove pant so this is thewonder under roll down pant and theyhave these online currently so you mightbe able to catch them here it is it isjust a legging just basically a leggingthat's about $100 I know and you canfold these over which is nice but thisis really great because it syncseverything and you know like this islike Spanx but it's really comfortablelike this is super soft and then thereis a tiny Lululemon a Signia here but Idon't can't find it so that's also righthere there's like a black one right herebutI don't know I didn't find feel likethese were Holy Grail ones so I boughtthem for full price online so I think Imight bring them back I got a size twoand four to kind of test which one Iliked better and I like the four betterbut I don't know I'm not a huge fan ofthe wonder unders I know everybody lovestheir Wonder unders but they're not veryflattering on me I personally prefer alittle bit of a flare going out of theleg I feel like a little stumpy when Ijust wear really tight like paint likeleggings that are reallyyou,27,UC-ePURNUTvYu2dKvW0-tHqg,Central

I already almost cried when you'reasking me the silly questions fYI it's atotally charged thing see like oh I'mnot gonna can you just give me like sortof an overview of who you are as aperson person yeah okay I grew up herein Los Angeles raised by a single momwho had recently immigrated from Mexicoand in the 90s as a teenager there was alot of unrest around the immigrantcommunity proposition 187 seeingeverything was happening around the LAriots and all of that really awakenedfor me the idea of working in publicservice or finding a way to give back Ijoined the Obama campaign in Oh 8 whenhe won I was offered a job in the WhiteHouse best moment of all introducing mymom and my sister to President Obama andthe Oval Office that immigrant woman whocame when she was 18 19 years old what abeautiful thing that in one generationshe could be having that experience andhugging the first black president mywhole experience my boo's gonna be a wayless like woohoo then probably like someof your people but my experience is verywhat kind of almost like spiritual I'venever known a time in my life wherebreast cancer hasn't been present in ourfamily home which was in the beginning abunch of us mission to a small apartmentit was a lived experience mygreat-grandmother grandmother mom andtwo aunts have all had breast cancer andas you can imagine I started thinkingmaybe there was something in my familyhistory that could lead to this so in2013 I tested for the bracha genemutation and found out that I testedpositive which basically means that myrisk of developing breast cancer is 85%over my lifetime I decided pretty earlyon that I wanted to do whatever I couldto lower that risk in this case doing apreventive double mastectomy so aboutsix months ago I decided to go forwardwith this was the first day in thehospital and I still I still had anoxygen tube in my nose and my nurse inthe hospital came in and actuallystarted lecturing me on the importanceof breastfeeding your kidsI had just removed my breasts so you canimagine also as a woman all thedifferent layers our breasts the way wesee what therefore the responsibilitiesand the responsibilities we have toourselvessix days after my surgery I received acompletely shocking call when you have amastectomy preventively they take thetissue that's removed and they test itjust routinely right the one thing I wasnot prepared for was to get a cancerdiagnosisI lost my words hearing that you hadcancer you know that is completelydevastating but then a hearing that youdon't anymore and that you don't have todo any treatment you've basically beatit it's something to rejoice over if youcan imagine these two completelyconflicting emotions on opposite ends ofthe spectrum at the same time it took mea while to process it now I continue onwithout my natural breast but these newbreasts are gonna be with me and I Ifeel affection towards them and I feellike I mean we're buzzed what sound whatthey make huhthat sound that was like a relief soundI think that's right one of the thingsthat I learned through this experiencewas the power of trusting your intuitioncoming out of this knowing that therewas a voice inside of me that told me totake the test they told me to have thesurgery to do it when I did even whenpeople might have questioned what I wasdoing I just felt it in my gut and sowhat a validation for that and alsolearning how to cultivate that voicethat is something that I'll take for therest of my life my great grandmotherdidn't have healthcare and because ofthat she was afraid to ask for amammogram and because of that by thetime she had one it was too late andthen I saw my experience you know havinggood health care and all thisinformation and how different I felt andso I started trying to think of waysthat I could share this knowledge butalso raise awareness of genetic testingso the well-woman coalition is aninitiative to empower women of color tohave agency over their own health andhealing you've chose the issues you careabout but a lot of times they choose youthis women's health piece of it thiscancer awareness piece of it has been adrumbeat that's that's been always theremy wish for the women of the world is tobe the CEO of your own body especiallynow when women's bodies are being usedas a political football and that that'salso my message to the men in the worldthat women are the CEO of their own bodyI'm Alejandra Campo Verdi I'm a women'shealth advocate and the founder of thewell woman coalition these are my boobsand this is their truth[Music]you[Music],23,UCGEU5Xa_5HKMb6gEFfGYdTw,wallstrip,3,5,0,15,"['lululemonathletica', 'fitsugar', 'bloggingstocks', 'wallstripipo', 'ipo', 'initialpublicoffering', 'cbs', 'webvideo', 'cbsnews', 'cbs.com']",Wallstrip IPO&#39;s: Lululemon athletica inc.

hey Internet so by popular demand todayI'm doing a Lululemon collection videowhere I show you all the pieces that Iown but I thought I might as well alsodo an outfit of the day for it you cansee hi where the pieces when I'm notexercising because you know put togetheras an exercising outfit I think itspeaks for itself I may do some outfitof the days when I go running in thefuture why not maybe during a vlog but Ialso wear my little lemon pieces a lotduring my everyday life when I'm notexercising and I think it is that youknow double purpose that really makesthe investment in aluminum and clothingworth it because I do wear them in twodifferent waysso I guess we should just get right intothe outfit on my feet I am wearing mywell-worn and well-loved Tory BurchRivas with the gold buckle he's got alot of wear when I was working in HongKong and I am still loving them and thenI'm wearing my leggings from Lululemonthey call these the wonder under as theyare reversible so they're great on oneside but I'm wearing them on the blackside today and these are great to gorunning it and I wear them a lot to gorunning and then as a top I have Ibelieve this called the power dance tankthis is last year's version I adore thisstyle of top because it's nice andsupportive for when you go running ithas a built in bra and it's just reallynicely shaped it goes into like at-shape at the back um and I just lovethe ballerina look to it I wear it a lotand of course it is like pink and Iadore pink so it's very mean and thenI'm just wearing my wrap this is themuder wrap and as all the recent piecesdo it has a thumb hole so that you canuse that if you want to I often justkind of wrap them back I like them butsometimes they bother me so I sort ofput them on and take them off repeatedlyand I'm not sure if this is a white or agrey it's basically like a heatheredwhite color and every year they come outwith some version of the mud wrap andsometimes it's shorter in the back andsometimes it's longerthis is last year's version and they didlong ones last year but the year beforethat they did a short version so when Ido the collection upstairs you will seeI have a blue one that is actuallyshorter in the back just because theyalways kind of switch things up a littlebit over time it is really fun justI've been collecting my little lemonpieces for something like five years sowhen you look at what I have you canalmost see like a progression of lulu asthey've sort of modified their designsand come out with new ones so like Isaid the theme of this outfit isballerina inspired so I wore my hair alittle bit curled with some pink lipgloss and then I have a little headbandon I don't know whether it's gettingburied in my hair and it has littlerosettes on them and then just some verysimple crystal studs and let's goupstairs so I can show you what I haveso here we are this is my wholecollection and I'm gonna go through andshow you everything and tell you mythoughts on them and keep in mind thatthis is five years worth of Lululemonaddiction so I definitely have a lot ofpieces it's crazy to see them alltogether but also kind of fun like Ifeel like I've turned my room into likea little store or something so righthere this is one of Lulu's more classicitems for sure and the first thing Iever got from them about five to sixyears ago is this jacket this is theoriginal hoodie that they had so it'snot the scuba I don't remember the namethat they used to call them but it has asignificantly shorter waist than the newones do so these are the scuba that theyhave in now and this is the way it usedto look and it has you can see the waistdifference here and then they also hadadded like thumb holes now and I adoredthis jacket and like seriously tell meyou guys like do you think that thislooks six years old because I think itreally really doesn't like it doesn'tshow anywhere at all and so in additionto that I've purchased a hot pink andgray one a light light like one which isprobably my favorite color right now Ijust think it's so pretty it's just areally nice almost iris color if youknow like iris flowers it's a reallynicepetal color between somewhere betweenpink and purple I suppose and thenturquoise one that I really like as wellwith the white zipper and it has a microstripe so if on the website you seeanything with micro stripe you can seein real life it looks almost heatheredbecause the stripe is so very very finethat it just injects a little bit ofwhite into what would otherwise be asolid color so those are my hoodie's Ilove these for like in-between season sothey're definitely like a really reallyfun thing and I still love them so yeahand then I guess we'll just go around sothese are the meditate pullovers I thinkthey call them but they're basicallyjust off-the-shoulder sweaters I supposethey're Lululemon's answer to wild foxsweaters they also have thumb holes thisone is in a knitted heather grey but itlooks almost white and it's so soft Ithink it's a cashmere bamboo blend orsomething like that I'm not sure whatthe exact make of the fabric is becauseevery one of Lululemon's tops that hasbeen made in the last few years has atear-off tag so there's no longer thefabric components on there and then thisis another one which i think is alsocalled the meditate but it's a differentfabric so this one is more of like aterry cloth hoodie material like anormal hoodie and it also has some holesand it's sort of a bit of a looser cutlike it's a bit longer at the back andshorter at the front so moving on topants I feel like maybe this is the partthat you guys are the most interested inbecause it is Lululemon's defining itemthis is the original pair of pants theseones are really old they're called thegroove which is a looser bootcut set ofpants and they fit really nicely sort ofa bit low waisted but not very and yeahthey're just great they have areversible waistband and at first Ithought I wouldn't wear the grey a lotbut you can see they've lasted years andI wear them a lot then of courserecently you guys have seen lemon havebeen designing pants that are a bitdifferent from their original designsand using different fabrics so these arethe Lulu 2 pants which are actuallyshaped like sweatpants butreally nicely fitted at the back if youknow what I mean and they have a nicethick waistband and they're just so sovery comfy I've worn them a couple oftimes but I think they need to beshortened for sure so I need to go anddo that but I wanted to show you guys mycollection before I bring them into thestore so yeah if you don't knowLululemon does free alterations on theirclothes which is awesome and I thinkmakes a price tag that much morejustifiable so this is the still pantand I know one of you guys had a lot ofquestions about this pair of pants and Ican't honestly recommend them this isprobably the only piece from Lululemonthat I've ever regretted buying justbecause on my small 5'4 frame theyreally look too loose they're extremelyloose around the leg they don't havethat much shape at all until you getmuch higher up on the pants and I justdon't find they fit as well as the restof Lululemon's items of course that isjust my personal opinion and it probablyhas a lot to do with my body shape if Iwas a lot taller they would look a lotbetter for sure but also like I don'ttend to go for pants that are very looseI prefer ones that are a little bit moreshaped to my body so these are myfavorite pants to go running in therenot wonder unders but they're verysimilar to them they're leggings butthey have seams going down them whichgives them a really interesting sort ofI don't know just tailored kind of lookto them and they are awesome to gorunning because they have an extra bitof stretch to them even stretchier thanthe Wonder unders they also have pocketsthat lay nice and flat and a nice longwaistband so they're a little bit higherwaisted than wonder unders as well andsometimes I wear these guys with like asweater dress or a simple sweater andthey look really cool and sort of designor II just because of those seams thatgo lower down and just look really neatso yes then you have my all-timefavorite lulu pants here if I had tojust pick one pair that isn't leggingsfrom Lululemonthese are the ones that I would pickthey're called the Astros they areamazing oh my goodness you guys thesewill conceal anybaby or muffin top that you were havingon any given day they're just lifesavers they have a medium-high rise andthis just definitely like suckseverything in but still feel socomfortable I adore the Astro pants andthey have a little bit of a bootcut butit's a cut a lot slimmer than theoriginal groove so you can definitelycompare the two by saying that the Astrois just a slimmer cut of the groove ifthat makes senseand then one of this year's designswhich is really really cool and Ibelieve these are called the city pantsand they are cut to have a trouser likefit with pockets they're very slimfitting they're almost actually they'repretty much exactly a straight cut andthey look really really nice they'realmost a bit easier to wear the leggingswith a regular top they really do looklike black pants from far away youhonestly couldn't tell the differencethen I have some crops over here there'sthe astro crop there with the pinkwaistband and then there those are someclam diggers which are a lot of a looserstraight cut but I really like them toofor the summer they're awesomeI wear them they like go hiking and thatkind of thing if I don't want to wearshorts they're awesome and then probablymy favorite pair of shorts on our ownare these from Lululemon which is crazythey're just so simple little blackshorts but they have the perfect fit onmy body they're just long enough to looknice and I have my vApps so I have apurple wine and a blue one and then ofcourse a grey one that I just showed youthat is the mudra now these guys have alittle bit more of a stretchy fabric tothem and I believe they're actuallycalled the universals but I'm not 100%sure because they don't have themavailable right now the wraps are kindof yearly items and every year they comeout in different colors and kind of haveto jump on these I think they're theitems that sell out the quickest becausethey are just so incredibly versatileand comfy they also have the thumb holesthey look so flowy almost like acardigan version of a pashmina andthey're extremely long lasting as wellI've had this blue one for several yearsand it hasn't peeled on me at all and itwashes really really nicely and I justlove the drape you lookbut I don't want to talk too much aboutthem because you guys have already seenwhen on me these are just the othercolors that I have now if you are intoexercising outdoor at all then you mustpurchase a defying jacket from Lululemonseriously you guys not that I'm tellingyou what to buy or anything but everytime I wear the news I'm just likeamazed at how awesome they are becausethey don't ride up on me at all thatreally annoys me when I go running theyalso have some holes which becomesalmost a necessary feature for me when Igo running I just like everything toreally stay in place and they look sonice and feminine and fitted if I unfoldone I'll show you the shape of it incase you haven't seen it before like canyou guys see how it just makes yourwaist look so tiny and oh they're justso pretty the detail of it and theseaming on it it's like you'd had acustom-made running jacket so I havethem in three colors black gray andheathered gray or not hazard sorry it'sa micro stripe gray and then I also havethis kind of blue berry color it'spretty much the exact color ofblueberries so then I have some moredance tops you guys saw the pink onethat I have which is the color from lastyear the year before then I have a blackand gray one and this is this year'scolor so this is a really prettylavender color and I just love thesethey're so soft and comfy I adore themthen I have some t-shirts and this isthe original crew neck I think it'scalled and then recently you guys saw inmy haul I got a black one that's calledthe every yogi tea and it fits prettymuch exactly the same as the crew neckbut a little bit more loose if thatmakes sense but otherwise to all intentsand purposes they're the same and theseare great to get go on sale I find a lotof people I don't know might not buythese as much so if you wait it out fort-shirts and you're flexible with thecolor you can usually nab these andthough we made too much section of thewebsite which I door because spending alot of money on it t-shirt does seemsilly but these are awesome because theylast for so long I mean I've had thesetwo for years and they haven't peeled onme at all and they just last likeoutlast all of my gap t-shirts anddefinitely foreverwhen tops for sure for the most partthis is another empire-waist top I'm notreally sure what it's called becausethey don't have it anymore but it's verysimilar to the dance one except thatthis part of it is actually like arunning thin material that doesn't haveany stretch to it and I don't wear thisone as much actually I like to stretchydance one better but I like it too inthe color is pretty and then I have a CRB so these are the cool racer backsthey're just long stretchy tank topsthat are also awesome for running orexercising and they just fit reallynicely they have that tee back that isawesome to cover up a sports bra andthen I have a black tank top with nicethick straps that has a built-in bralike and all of the empire waist tops dobut it's more close fitting like it fitspretty close to my body and I think thiswas called the heart because it has aheart-shaped neckline and I thought thatwas so pretty about it it came out atChristmas time a few years ago and I'vedefinitely seen it in again and again sothey kind of reap remote on this shapeand I'm not surprised to thing becauseit's really nice and flattering and thenthere's my scarf doesn't it look nice onmy teddyI thought that was quite funny I adorethat scarf it was definitely one of mysillier splurges from Lululemon thoughbecause spending like over $50 on ascarf is not something I would reallyever do but I just fell in love with thesort of mint candy apple color of it andI think it's such a pretty aqua colorfor spring and summer so I had to get itand then I just wanted to show you guysthe sports bras that I have for Lulu Imean I know a lot of people reallydisagree with putting this kind of stuffon YouTube but that said you know it'ssuch an important part of exercising fora girl so I thought I would show you theones that I have I have two black onesfrom Lululemon and I love them both umthey just are really nice and supportivethis is the second most level of supportand this is the greatest level ofsupport that they have and this one iscalled a taut taut tamer and this onedoesn't exist anymore but they'vereplaced it with one called theadjustable and I actually asked in astore andgirl said that they're virtuallyidentical except that in how they haveadjustable straps so this one is awesomeit's just you're pretty much standardsports bra with a tee strap back and itis awesomely supportive for somethingthat is just really comfortable to wearit doesn't feel restrictive at all andit doesn't flap them too much eitherwhich is awesome because of course youknow like a big part of buying all ofthese things from Lululemon is so that Ican feel really good about myself when Igo exercise and I know that's notequally important to everyone but it'simportant to me and some days it's justwhat makes a difference between goingout for a run and not going out for arun is having like some fun pieces towear so the tattoo tamer how have thefunniest names ever it's kind of silly Imean it looks a bit scary I find like inthe store it took me a while before Ibought one of these but now that I havethem I do really like them because helooks so good on it doesn't look likeyou have a sports bra on at all becauseit has padding and shaping to it andthey have nice thick address adjustablestraps and I promise once you put themon they don't look scary at all they dohave quite a high rise so sometimes likethey won't work with every top if youhave a really low-cut top but even ifthey do peak out a little bit itactually looks quite nice it's just abit like an inch of mesh basically andit just looks really nice I promise andthey don't look scary at all and I havejust really enjoyed having these so Ithought I would share them with you I'mhopefully you guys don't mind so yesthat is pretty much it for all of myLululemon pieces and yeah thank you somuch for watching this and to those ofyou who requested this video thank youfor the requests if you want to see anymore Lululemon videos like outfits ofthe day let me know I think it would befun to do those for sure,25,UCF4LEacx9sDvAbEJnlaJfKQ,KPIX CBS SF

all right what's up you guys so Ithought today I would sneak into mybedroom because it's the only semidecorated semi put together room in thehouse I thought I'd take a corner andshow you guys some of my favorite recentgarage sale finds um and these arethings that I scout out the night beforeI look for garage cells that look likethey might be selling fancy itemsdesigner item there was a yard salewhere they were advertising Lululemon soof course like alarm bells are going offand I put that right on my lap they didsay that they were not charging likecheap prices they were gonna they theywarned customers $20 or more per itemsso I knew I'd have to be selective aboutwhat I picked because things like tanktops for Lululemon it's not worth paying$20 for it unless it's like a reallyrare print so I was looking at primarilylong leggings special patterns forskirts and even like capri leggings andeven then like they still had beyond theLululemon they had really cute like FreePeople and Tory Burch and cute thingslike that so but I'm gonna go over myfavorite finder that day and it's thesethese are the Lululemon Beach scapewonder under leggings I knew when I sawthem that it was an interesting andunique print anytime you see aninteresting unique print remove I'm inlike you should hone in on it like ahoming pigeon so I definitely zeroed inand tractor-beam straight to the weirdprayer to Peru them andand I brought these home looked them upand comps are crazy people have theselisted for 300 plus dollars now I don'tthink the sold listings reflect actuallygetting $300 so I have priced mine at250 and we'll see what I get butsuper-crazy fine and then in addition Ifound some Lululemon skirts and like forthose of you who are brand brand newLululemon is this little symbol herethere you goLululemon so always look for that eventrained my husband I'm like you knowwhat Lululemon looks like write the logohe's like yeah yeahI have quizzed him many times um theseruffle skirts like again unique printsunique patterns camo print anythingthat's like camo print this is like it'skind of like the oil slick camo printfor these speed shorts those will dogreat and I learned also that this ifthe Lululemon symbol has if the symbolhas anything special around the logothat's unique it's a sea wees printwhich are even more rare and unique sosea wees SCA wh e ze and they'll be fromcertain years and it's just easier tolook up that way so if you see that tagthat is a Seabees print um yeah and thenagain I picked up probably I want to say20 pieces of Lululemon at that garagesale and again I had to be pretty selectselective I told them if you haveleftover and you want to lower the priceI will come back so I always kind ofthrow that out there I let people knowwhat I do and they know exactly what Ido and they're really sweet but yeah I'mhonest I just st. if you wanna get ridof itgirl I'll give you a fair price um okayand then a couple more for eBay I'm sureyou've seen these I always think ofParks and Rec when I see these vibramore Vibram Five toe shoes because likeChris introduces them to Andy rightanyway so these always always sellanywhere from thirty five to fiftydollars depending on condition and styleso yeah I always grab these things for adollar and then um I pick a fossilpretty regularly that focuses andanything fossil that's like a largecrossbody right don't know why I justtried that on um anything that's like acrossbody or a messenger style bag fromfossil so it's really fast for me so Ialways kind of pick those up in fact Ihad one that I purchased for two dollarsit was a little bit larger had the flapover was a leather fossil messenger bagand it sold within a day for $55 sosomething to keep in mind not all fossilis great but the messenger bags and thecross bodies do really well and thenanother thing you might not be lookingfor breast pumps this one was literallybrand new um never been open never beenused breast pumps so great for me oneBay I have sold and that guy prefer tosell brand new breast pumps um forobvious reasons so I found this brandnew I will sell it on eBay Amazon itjust always seems to be restricted inthose little trickier eBay is wherethose kinds of items go and this shouldsell for this brand is hygeia high jayait should sell for anywhere from onehundred two hundred and fifty dollarsnow moving on to Amazon framesI found this remote and you may thinkit's a remote who cares this universalremote sells for like over a hundreddollars new so in fact I think it sellsfor $100 use and go back and what goodcops again but I will be sending this toAmazon remotes are great especially ifthey look big fat and fancy and ouruniversal remotes because people losermows all the time and people want oneremote for like their whole movie systemor their TV systems so these universalremotes really sell well because peoplewant to buy them they don't want to haveten remotes out on their console anotherthing I always pick up our game gameconsoles and even if the controller isjust by itself I will always pick it upespecially actually only if it's an OEMcontroller meaning if it's the originalmanufacturer controller like there's alot of knockoffs that like are offbrands I never get those I always pickup it says there that logo yeah thesecontrollers do great and it sellsconsistently first one you to $30depending on Commission and depending onstylethis was another fun find these this isa flight system controller okay and itcomes with this thing and you would lookat it and go I don't know what is thatthing and I would think the same thingexcept I've picked them up several timesand this particular one sells for 130 to150 dollars like I guess I don't knowlike the logic behind it I think there'sa lot of flight simulation games thatrequire fancy controls or I don't knowif it's for flight school practice orwhat but these sell great and the rankis crazy good so I would always like ifyou just start randomly seeing thingsthat look interesting and unique go lookit up I just find the like name thebrand name right and then I just willlook that up on Amazon and there itpulls up it's so easy so um that wasanother fun find and then this booktextbooks I love selling textbooks now Ican remember what this one specificallysold sells for I think between 40 and 60dollars these textbooks sell great Iwill always stop and look at textbookswhen I am at yard sales now when you goto yard sales you're gonna see a millionbooks and it can be overwhelming tothink I have to scan all of them so isto just go through to the text books bigbooks large books hardbacks fat booksEnglish type books like like any kind ofuniversity style book fiction Passovercookbooks Passover I would look athistory books religion books butbiographies Passover there's just a lotof random books set you can guaranteelike yeah maybe there's a biography outthere or a fiction book out there thatsells for a lot but odds are you're notgoing to find it at a garage sale so ifyou're in a hurry like go straight forthe textbooks history books English bigfat college looking but stuff likeum yeah that's it I want to make

athleticandyoga wear store they sell leggings thatare like 100 bucks there's no other wayto put itpoint blank expensive leggings i hearthey feel like butter on your skinthat's all i'm going to say about itthis lululemon store is located in amoderate communityit's in bethesda maryland and it's justa middle class areashopping center located right next to anapple storeyou get the vibe it's a whole vibe rightso on march 12ththe store manager rachel goes to openthe store just before 8 am and shenotices that the doors are not lockedthat's an immediate red flagbecause a high-end store like this hasroutine security and precautions thatthe closing shift employees are trainedto handleso she just assumes that maybe theyforgot these tasks the night before andshe opens the door anywaysbut it didn't take long for her torealize that something wasn't rightthings were out of place and knockedover and her rachel's alarm bells arestarting to ringso she runs out of the store in a panicbeing that this location is right nextto that apple store there are peoplewaiting outside for the release of theipad 2.a man named ryan is waiting in line andhe notices rachel's panic and heapproaches hershe tells him what she found in thestore and she asks how longhe had been standing outside if he hadnoticed any suspicious activityor if he had seen anyone come in and outof the store ryan lets her know that hehad been outside waiting for about anhour and at this pointnothing had happened he didn't noticeanything but he did offer to gointo the store and take a look aroundwith rachelso the two of them enter the store andas they're walking towards the cashregistersthey start to see more things out ofplace there's mannequinsstraight about there's clothing all overthe floorit just didn't look right um theycontinue walking through the buildingandum notice that the registers and thesafes are open and empty there'sreceipts thrown aboutit looks like a robbery took place anduh rachel's like i'm gonna hold it rightherei'm not going any farther and ryan'slike listen i'm a hero and i'm gonna gocheck okayso he walks to the back of the buildingthere'sglass everywhere things are knocked overandhe immediately realizes there's a trailof blood with what looks likefootprints there's also blood on thewalls guyslots of blood okay ryan continueswalking to the back roomfollowing the blood trail until he findsa woman's dead body on the floorshe's laying face down in a pool of herown blood with a rope around her neckand ryan immediately begins to panicbecause this is like a horror movie andhe's likenope i'm out of here but as soon as heturns around to go tell rachel what'shappening he hears a noiseand of course he's like i have to go seewhat that noise isso he opens the employee bathroom and hefinds another womancovered in blood on the floor her handsand her feet are zip tied togetherhe does notice that she's stillbreathing and she's still alivebut she has what looks like a lot ofcuts all over her body and there's bloodall around her and he just can't tellhow bad it isso he runs the front of the store andryan and rachel call 9-1-1when the paramedics arrive rachelimmediately realizes who the two womenarethey are the closing shift employees thewomanwho is still alive and breathing is 28year old brittany norwood andthe woman who was dead was 30 year oldjayna murraywhen the police arrived they immediatelygo over to brittany and findthat her hands were zip tied above herhead her shirt was pulled up above herstomach but not exposing anythingand she had a shirt tied around her neckbut it wasn't strangling her it was justlike tighther leggings had been cut away at thecrotch and the police devised that thismust have been a horrible sexual attackon the womanand a robbery police also find a rockcovered in blood on the floorin the back room and they they concludedthat this must have been the main weaponused in the attack paramedics pronouncedjaina dead on the scenein the room there was an open tool boxthat was property of lululemon and mostof the tools that were scattered aroundthe room were bloodyin fact there was just blood everywhereso crime scene investigatorsstart to do their digging they quicklyrealized that there are two sets offootprints in the bloodone was a smaller woman's shoe size sixand the other pair was a large men'sshoe size 14.the men's shoe print led all the way tothe back of the storewhere there's a fire exit there's bloodall over the exit door but nothingoutside of the door no blood no shoeprints nothinghow creepy does that sound i see youstop for a second think about that youget there and then all of a sudden yougot to open the door and there's nothinglike almost like a person trying toescape that gets pulled back in i swearit's like a horror movie setting rightjust creepy anyways they assumed one ofthe women was trying to flee the scenebut becausethe attacker must have caught her rightat the door they just brought her backin there was a key in the back doorlike they were opening the door withoutenabling the alarmbut they saw nothing outside of thebuilding sojaina's body was removed and taken foran autopsyshe had sustained at least get this 331separate wounds do you guys can youunderstandhow long that would take to do 331separate wounds on a person just thinkabout that for a second okaymost of these wounds were layered on topof each other some were self-defensesome were stab wounds some were frombeing beaten over200 of those wounds were just in herface and head alone200 there were 13 skull fracturesand there were five wound patterns whichmeans that there were at leastfive weapons used on jayna's body i meanit's just it's vicious it's violent it'sawful it's grossbrittany on the other hand was taken tothe hospital to have her wounds treatedmost of her wounds were very superficialshe was cleaned up given some lightbandagesand the police decided they were goingto question her that same daybecause the sooner you start questioningthe more likely the victim is going tobe to remember little detailsso i'm going to go into a little bit ofa backstory about each of the victimsinvolved in this casejaina murray was a positive person shehad an infectious personalityshe was pursuing two degrees whileworking at lululemonshe had a long time boyfriend who wasactually in the process ofproposing to her and she loved to travelthe worldshe was considered a shift manager sothe night of the murder jaina was inchargebrittany on the other hand she was bornin seattle washingtonone of nine siblings she had a happy andloving childhoodand was very athletic she absolutelyloved soccerand she was part of her university teamhowever that was pretty short-lived forherum she would actually get in troublewith her teammates because they quicklynoticed that whenever britney was aroundthings from their lockers and bags weregoing missing just small things like lipglossand earrings and they decided toconfront britney about it and she fessedup to itshe said that she was sorry and that itwould never happen again but she wasslowly shunned from the teamshe started playing less and less gamesand getting invited toevents less often so she decided shejust needed to move on with her life andmake new friendsthat kleptomaniac side of herunfortunately never left though and shecontinued to steal from other jobsand other people but it is no surprisewhy britney chose lululemon because withher athletic background it just kind ofseemed likethe perfect fit for her however this wasnother first rodeo when it came to workingfor lululemon she was actuallytransferred from another store and we'regonna get back to that later okayso right now we're gonna go back to thesituation at handbritney's talking with the police andshe informs them that she wassexually assaulted so a rape kit is doneand it seems apparent that the assailantwas not trying to kill herum so brittany kind of goes into detailabout the night of the attackthe two locked up the store like anyother night jaina left in her car andbrittany heads for the subwayby the time that brittany got to thestation she realized she didn't have hermetro card she had left it at the storeand so she calls another co-worker toget jane's number because she didn'thave her number umso jaina agrees to go back to the storebecause she had actually left her laptopthereso they decided they're going to meetback at the store when jana pulls up tothe store she just kind of parks infront of the store you know like whenyou quicklyrun into the store and then quickly runout she didn't actually pull into aparking lotand both of the women enter the storeand they start looking for britney'scardbut they can't find it so jaina offersto let brittany use her card for thenight and they'll find it you know thenext day when the store is openso they head back to the front of thestore when they notice that the door iswide openand out of nowhere two men dressed inall black run up on the women and startattacking thema tall whim a tall woman a tall manstarts attacking jainaand drags her to the back room wherebritney has no idea what's happeningbrittany's attacker takes her to theregister has her empty all the moneyinto a baghe takes her to a different room andties her up and starts assaulting herbritney says the man then spared herlife threw her into theemployee's bathroom and then took off sothe cops now have kind of like asemblance of what went down that nightandthey decide they're gonna check thecamera footage around the arealo and behold the apple store next doorhas cctv footageand there on the camera are two mendifferent heightsand all black walking past the storethis looks exactly like britney'saccount of the storyso between the accounts of the camerafootagebritney's recount phone call recordsand the apple security team hearingnoisesthey can narrow down the time of theincident to around 10 15 pmand as police are starting to to kind ofpiece things together they realizewait a second where's jayna's carbrittany said it was parked out frontbut it's no longer thereum so they start looking around forjaina's cara separate police officer had actuallynoticed jaina's car because it had texasplates and it was located just a fewblocks from the crime scenehe had just been fortunately driving byhe acknowledged that he saw itand he was able to take the cops back tothe locationand the car was then taken in forforensics and police decided to lookmore into the camera footage while theywaited for the results of the vehiclethe police planned a stakeout mission tosee if the men in black clothing wouldreturn to the sceneand guess what they do two men twodifferent heightsand all black walk past the store thesemen are taken in for questioning andquickly eliminatedas suspects when it comes back thatthey're just servers at a nearbyrestaurant they just so happen to bewalking home at the time of the murderit's an utter coincidence right so nowthe police are back toreviewing all the evidence at this pointthey're still waiting on the vehicletheir camera footage is leading nowhereand they realizethere's little details that just are notadding upeverything used in the attack was foundinside of the storeincluding the weapons and even the zipties so let's think about thatsomeone is assuming that a high-endathletic store would have zip tiesand all these weapons and it's just astrange assumptionfor any assailant to do if you're goinginto a murder you're gonna take your ownweapons it'sit's not smart to just assume thatthey're all gonna be there right it'ssuspiciousso they're starting to realize they needto piece this attacktogether from a different angletypically when a robbery happens theperson involved spends as little time aspossible at the scene rightyou want to get in and out get yourstuff boom i'm gonebut it's weird because there was anextensive amount of wounds on jaina'sbody and it wasn't adding upthat that could be an mo for robbery theattack would have lasted over 15 minutesand it would have beenfull of rage not to mentionthere were only two sets of footprintsin the store if there were two separatemen and then two women who were there asvictims there would obviously be foursets of footprintsso while we're on the topic of thatpolicestarted kind of talking around toeverybody people next door working atthe apple storerachel and rachel tells them somethingthat's really suspiciousthere was actually a pair of size 14shoes located in the store and this pairof shoes was there for customers to wearwhile trying on clothingum that's why it was a large size it'smeant to fit everybody's feetso at this point the police are likewhoa these men camein they changed shoes they assumed allof this gear was going to be there forthem to usethey would have all the tools that theyneed to rob these women without bringinganything into the store that justdoesn't make senseand then they think okay why werebritney's wounds next to nothing andjaina's wounds were lethallike jaina really got the brunt end ofthe dealso now police are wondering if maybe thewhole thing was set up by britney likemaybe she knew these men maybe she letthem inand they start to do some digging intobritney's pastit does not take long to see her truecolors okay britney would steal fromfriendsshe scammed businesses she even liedabout graduating college she told herparents that she couldn't walk becauseshe had student loan debtno that's a lie okay that's a lieum so red flags are starting to pop upin their brainsand they realize that this wasn't thefirstlululemon location that brittany hadworked at brittany had been accused ofstealing from the last location that shewas at and then transferred to thisstoreand brittany was already on watchaccording to rachel becauseof some incidents that had already gonedown that just were kind of againstcompany moraleso annually like one time a yearemployees are allowed to receive a 70off discount with a capand this discount is to buy clothingthat way you can wear it around thestore and kind ofessentially show off what you're sellingwhich totally makes sense i get that70 off that's pretty crazy for lululemonsoit makes sense that they would put a capon it well britney had asked her managerif she could go overjust a little bit because there was somestuff that she wanted and her manageragreed a little bit is fineno britney went double over that limitwhich is crazy because howon earth could you ever need that manypairs of leggings i mean i have a lot ofleggings and i could not imagineever needing that many pair of lululemonleggingsso she has that strike on her she hadalso been caught stealing beforeand there was actually a company policywhereum employees were required to check eachother's bagsat the end of the night to account forany merchandise that was soldwell jaina found a pair of leggings inbrittany's bagand brittany told jana that anotheremployee had actually rang her up forthemso jaina calls this other employee andguess what she didn't ring brittany upso this incident happened the day beforethe murder takes place are you startingto piece it together a little bitokay so we're going to go back to theinvestigation soforensics from the car have come in andthey show brittany and jana's blood areboth in the carthey bring brittany in for questioningand this time they're careful on howthey bring up informationthey ask britney where the men found thezip ties and she lets them know that oneof the men pulled them from his backpackthen they asked brittany if she had everseen jana's car or been inside of it andshe saysno so they now realize britney is lyingbecause there was actually a baseballcap found in jaina's car withbritney's blood on it and the exact sameplace that matched a head wound that shehad sustained from that eveningso why would they take the hat from herhead and then place it in the car thatjust doesn't make senseand the zip ties those were found to beproperty of lululemon according torachelso brittany leaves the station afterbeing questioned and she becomes thenumber one suspectin the eyes of the police at this pointthen the rape kit comes back and it'snegativeso the forensic scientists go back tothe crime scene they're reevaluatingthe scene as if two mysterious men hadnever entered the storeso whole new a fresh pair of eyes rightfirst they look at the zip ties and theynotice something tellinguh there's teeth marks on these zip tiesas if someone used their mouth to pullthe ties tight together around britney'swristwhich that would be extremely awkward ifit was anybody other than britney doingthatso that's a red flag boom like i'm sorrybut there's like 50 red flags by thispoint you know what i meanlike watch out okayso they notice also that most of theblood in the bathroom with brittany hadbeensmeared rather than pulled along withthe fact that there were blood-soakedpaper towels all over the roomalmost like britney or someone had comein wiped up jane's blood and smeared iton herself to look like she bled morethan she actually didso out of nowhere they'repiecing all this together and brittanydecides to show back up at the policestation and she says she has some newinformationshe says that the robbers had actuallytaken her to jaina's car and told herthat she hadto drive and hide it britney tells thepolice that the men told her to comestraight back and they would find herand kill herif she didn't do it so instead ofstopping to tell someone what's going onand that your your co-worker is beingmurdered in the back of the room you'retelling me you're going to get in a cargo hide the car because these murdererstold you to and then you're not going tostop and tellanyone you're just going to go rightback to these two murderers who knowwhat you look likelike you wouldn't drive to a policestation i know that people act differentwhen a crime is being committed icompletely understand that but thishas never made sense to me that thatjust wouldn't make sense it's bizarrethat she's bringing this information upnow like all of a sudden you're justremembering thisreally small but actually very importantdetail that's not really smallthat doesn't make sense it's not addingup again that's weirdthat's suspicious cardi b would have myback on this rightokay so at this point police are lookingat each other likenone of this makes sense they confrontbritneyabout everything they tell her itdoesn'tit's not adding up you know the zip tiesituation's not adding upyour background's not really adding upwhat's going on hereso they decide they're gonna bring herfamily in with the hopes that maybeher brother or her sister can get her toconfess and let them know what'sactually going onand her brother tells her you know youneed to tell me what's going on hereshe tells him to look around the roommake sure there's no equipment nocameras nothing but this is a policestation like guys seriously if you'reever in an interrogation room i'mletting you know right nowthere are cameras okay you cannot escapethe camerasum and britney conconfesses she tells her brother shetells her brother in a very very lightwayokay but it was enough for police to belike we've got you we've got you withthe evidence we understand what happenedherethis was an act of vengeance theyassumed thatmaybe jaina was going to tell rachelabout the incidentand some sort of repercussion was goingto happen and britney could not allowthat to happen she couldn't lose her jobso on march 18th brittany norwood wasarrestedshe goes to trial with the defense thatshe snapped and she had a lapse injudgmentit was just a mental break it was reallythe only defense that she could havewith all the evidence that was againsther which is understandable with herbackground likei mean she was a kleptomaniac she hadstalked boyfriendsshe had lied about graduating college umshe didn't have any other defense[Music]but it didn't take long for thedeliberation of the jury that lastedless than anhour uh she had guilty written all overher forehead and she was found guilty offirst-degree murderand she was sentenced to life in prisonwithout the possibility of paroleso you know if you start lying aboutthings guysi think the moral of this story is itjust keeps getting worse it's just goingto keep piling up and piling up andpiling upalso another lesson is there's always umrecordings in an interrogation room okayso if you think they're not recordingyou they probably arebut um yeah so that's the case of thelululemon murdersand i really hope that you guys enjoyedit i hope you enjoyed this setupi'm really excited with the way that itturned out i really enjoy the colorpalettesand i had a lot of fun creating it andi hope to see you guys next time my nextvideo is hopefully going to bemy may plan with me and i will haveanother story for you guysif this goes well uh we'll see about theresponse but yeah let me know in thecomments um if you have any otherrecommendations for cases thatyou want me to talk about because iwould absolutelylove to hear your guys's thoughts onwhat you want me to tellum if there's anything specific i willnot do anything that has to do withchildren that is where i draw the lineokay so any other case is up for grabsand you guys just let me knowagain i hope you enjoyed this thanks forhanging out with me umstay safe out there bye,17,UCCzODDnIM4xdZxOLUGF7KSg,lululemon,356,3986,0,6096,"['lululemon', 'yoga',

Lululemon they givethese awesome bags and what I'm going todo is I'm going to kind of I think I'mgonna start with sports bras where Imight work my way through tops and pantsand jackets and everything so the firstthing I'm going to show you is thissports bra so these these are the onesand this is very old they actually don'twe make this anymore which I'm reallysad about because this was a reallyawesome style and you can see it'sreally faded but I've had this bra forover five years so this is a bra thatclips together at the front and then ithas this racer back and this was calledlike the deep V or something along thoselines but once again they don't havethis anymore and also have it in thisgreat turquoise color yeah sadly theyjust continue this it's a littledisappointing because this was a funwe're also again it Clips up the frontand then it has the mesh backing whichis awesome this bra is just veryflattering looks really good on but likeI said they don't make it anymore sosadly you know it's not something youcan buy the the other bra I have fromthe collection and I don't know all ofthe names of these so I'm just going toshow them to you I don't think have newstyles some styles are there to stay andother styles arein and out so I'm not sure what thenames are cuz I remove this tags so thisis one of the bras it's reallylightweight the straps aren't adjustablebut they kind of self adjust and theycross at the back and I just really lovethe color and style of this I love thedark sort of charcoal grade with thepurple it's a nice pop of colorthis one's really comfortable and reallydurable I've washed this tons of timesstill doing great it has a little logoon the back and then the next one is mynewest one from the collection and thisI do know the name of it is the tautomerand these come in actual bra sizes whichI love so some of them come in sizeslike two four six eight and then otherones come in actual bra sizes so this isthe choctaw tamer I was wearing it inone of my past videos so it's nice toget to see it sort of you know not on aperson and then the back has theadjustable and you know Clips just likea normal bra and this one is reallysturdy it also comes with liners thatyou can add it and I took mine out towash it but yeah really nice really lovethis broth super supportive if you needa lot of support that's the one togethermy next one is this one I want to saythis is called the cross my heart braand it has this crisscross back and thenthe front is just sort of plain I lovethis color because it's the Paris pinkcolor that they had a while ago and Iabsolutely love this color so reallyhappy with this one I think that's allthe bras I have and so I guess I'll gointo top snacks and what I love about alot of little lemon tops is nothing gotbuilt in bras so just this being anexample this one's inside out myapologies this talk has the same top asthe brand purple bra I showed you butit's a top so you know it has that sameexact design on the top except it's flatthe straps are the same material andthey cross in the back and then the thebottom of the top is like a very softmaterial and then it has littledrawstringsso you can pull them you know sometimesyou're jumping around a lot and stuffyou don't want your talk jumping up so Ilike the feature of the drawstrings onthe bottom because it really allows youto sort of tighten your shirt whileyou're working outand then another one I have is this andsome of these tops are actually I justwear them like casually sometimes I wearthem when I'm not even working outbecause they're so cute so this one's alittle wrinkled but it's this top thathas the stripe top and then the loosebottom and then the straps are kind ofgirly they have sort of a little I guessthe straps aren't just straight theyhave little Kenneth I don't really knowwhat that is they're kind of looks likea pretty ribbon so I really like thatone and then what else do I have fortops so cool Razorbacks I have a ton ofthese and I'll just show you all of themthis one's really really old that's whyit's so faded this one's over five yearsold it's probably about six years oldcool Razorbacks are one of my favoritetanks they sell number one becausethey're long they last really long likeI said I've had this over six years andI still wear itthey washed well and the style isflattering with a nice Razorback so Ihave the white pink and then one of thenewer ones I have of the cool racerbackis this striped one so it's like a greymicro strength with black stripes then Ihave another strike one some of theseare actually still damp because I justthey were hanging to dry so this is kindof a small black and white micro stripeand then I have it in the hot pink lookslike thatand then I pop it in oh goodnesshere this I have it in this purple colorlike a nice bright purple I have it inblack but I don't really know where theblack one is oh geez yeah I can't findthe black one but I do I do also have itin black so I think that's allthat one in um I'm going to here's theblack one here it is whack so I do lovethe cool racerback which is why I do buyit in multiple colors it's just reallyflattering and easy and they're alsogreat layering tanks for just everydaywear you it's not just for the gym likeyou can wear it under anything you ownso that's what I love about itthen I have two of these tops and theseare these are really structured which Ilike but the middle is looser I alwaysjoke that when I get pregnant like theseare the tops I'm going to wear becausethe middles are loose so this is one ofthem and it's a beautiful gorgeous mintclean mint green color with a built-inbra a nice supportive straps and thenthe back has like a mesh to it and italso has like a little zipper you canput like your key or you know creditcard or whatever if you're just goingfor a run or something so I really likethis one and then I also have that exacttop in pink and grey again I really likethis one because it's supportive it'sgot the nice thick straps it's got thelittle mesh in the back it's you know itwicks away sweat so that's what that onelooks like that one pink and then one ofmy favorite talks from my entirecollection is actually this one and thisso the top is like a built-in bra grayand white stripe and then the sides arecut out and then the bottom just is thissoft loose material and then this onealso has the little drawstring so youcan send it out so I really really lovethis one it looks great on I love thecutouts on the side and speaking ofcutouts on the side some of you may haveseen this in onemore recent hauls and this is anothertop I have from the Lululemon collectionand this is the it's another one oh goshit's inside-outit's another one with the built-in brathese are so complicated when they'reall inside out oh goshanyways y'all have seen this in anothervideo I can link it below but this isanother one with like the built-in brain a nice bright color and then the backis like that and then has the cutouts onthe side so I really love that okaylet's move on to shorts I feel like I'mgonna have them all so these I havethree pairs of shorts from Lululemonthese are just um I think these arecalled the runs these shorts orsomething I'm 100% sure but I'll try tolink some of the stuff below so thatthis is what the hot pink band so theseare really old these are probably fiveor six years old these are one of thefirst pairs of shorts I ever got andthen the newer version of those sameshorts is this one this one has a babypink micro stripe and then the thing Ilove about it is that has these ventsyou won't be able to see on the videoI'm sure it has these vents in the backso they're really lightly and you knowit helps you not sweat as much or helpsget the sweat out and then has thislittle zipper in the back a littlepocket so these are really cute againthey're really short so for someone likeme who's tall it's kind of pushing thelimits with how short they are but whenyou're working out you need to becomfortable so that's the number onepriority and then these are a pair ofsort of like surfer shorts that I gotthere last summer and they have thiscute little and feminine detailing onthe pocket and they're made of adifferent material they're they'rewaterproof they're supposed to be forlike girls who want to wear these in theoceanthey surf and stuff so I really likethose and I don't use them for that Ijust wear them to work out then I havetwo pairs of still pants from Lululemonyou won't be able to see the whole thingthese fit extremely large I take a sizetwo in these because they fit so largethey're a wide leg looser fit so I havethem in a dark charcoal and then I alsohave them in black and these are like Imean I swear to you these are like sixor seven years old these are the firstthings like I ever bought from Lululemonand they're still going strong over themall the time especially when it's coolerout and then the last pieces of mycollection are jackets so the first oneI'll show you is this one this is sortof a heavier one it's got the hood sothis one's kind of better for wintertimeso it's got the hood and then it's gotthe logo the Lululemon logo on the frontand then the nice features are like thelittle thumb holes on the pockets it's anice heavy material which I absolutelyloveso very pleased with that and then Ihave this is my favorite one so this isthe defined jacket and carrot HeatherParis pink so once again it's just anice dip up jacket this is the back andthen it's got the cute little M littlearm the thumb holes on the arm it's gotthese great little pocket it's very nicesturdy zipper so I absolutely love thisjacket and you can see me wearing thisin some of my videos so if you want tosee how it looks on the link is belowand then finally I have this defyingjacket this one's really old this one'skind of on the fritz almost I've hadthis for years and years one of thefirst things I ever got and this onceagain is just a zip up jacket with anice high collar lots of zippers lots ofstorage compartments and then finallyokay finally one of my favorite thingsof all time in Lululemon's collectionare the wonder under cross so I have twopairs and these are reversible so theone side is like a is like a stripe grayand black and then the other sideactually matches one of my jackets andit's like a it's a very Heather look sothese are crops and then my other wonderunder crops are just the plain blackones but then they do have this pintucking on the bottom leg and the reasonI love wonder unders is number onethey're very flattering they feel greaton they look great on they're verycomfortable they're very stretchy youknow like these look tiny when you lookat them when I saw these I was like ohmy gosh how am I going to fit into thembut they stretch and they're veryflattering and they look incredible soI'm looking around that's if that's myentire Lululemon collection and onething I want to mention is that wasLululemon closed or never supposed toput them in the dryer and I haverecently started using the called RheaPalmer Oh Sam in sport wash so I washall of my little lemon clothes togetheralong with other you know my husband hassome sporting material clothes you knowlike the fabrics that wick away sweatthat laundry detergent is specificallymade for those so I've been using theCalgary I'm in pool morosa I put aquarter cup of it into the wash and Iput it on cold water on the gentle cycleor delicate cycle even hand washables ifyou like if you had that setting andthen I take everything out and hang dragall of it that's why I mentioned some ofit was still damp because I'm stillhanging some of it I'm from the lastwash that I did so definitely alwayshang dry everything wash and cold andtry to use a very gentle detergentbecause you don't want to ruin thefibers of the fabric and putting themyou know using fabric softener is anabsolute no-no they will pill they willget you know they're the fabric willlose its integrity so you definitely donot want to use fabric softener on theseand you don't want to put them inhe also wrecks the fibers of the fabricso hand washed cold water with a gooddetergent that's my best advice for thisand overall I just want to say that alot of people say oh well Lululemon soexpensive why do you spend so much moneyand on your workout where well I spendthe money because it lasts a long timelike I said some of my items here are atleast five or six years oldand they still look good I still wearthem they've kept their shape amazinglyyou know I guess after 10 years yeahsome of its gonna have to be replaced oryou know thrown away but I don't know alot of workout clothes that last thatlong and look good lasting that long soyeah you may have a t-shirt from anotherbrand or a tank top that lasts that longand doesn't fall apart but it's how itretains its shape the colors and thequality of the garment and the integrityof the fabric that's kind of what willreally tell you how the longevity ofsomething is and I really think it'sworth the money the styling is amazingyou won't find styles and colors in myopinion and in other brands that are ascute and flattering as these styles andalso the innovation part of it I feellike Lululemon is always coming out witheverything before any other umsportswear company is they're alwayslike trying different styles you knoweven their bras and stuff have reallycool backs it's as much of a focus onstyle as it is on function and that'swhat I really appreciate about thisbrand you can wear it to run errands youknow most most of the time if you'rejust running like a t-shirt and a youknow pair of Crocs or something from thegym you don't feel like as cute and somepeople don't care about looking cutewhen they work out that's fine you cando whatever you like I like to look cuteno matter what I'm doing you know I likethat I can buy a top that you know I goto the gym and and I also can goshoppingafterwards because it's really cute andflattering I personally reallyappreciate that and that's why I loveLululemon so thanks for watching I hopeyou enjoyed this collection and I'll seeyou

so a lot of people they love Lululemonyoga pants they're supposed to be veryflattering I I don't have that manyLululemon yoga pants when I what Ireally love to buy from Lululemon is thethe tank tops it's just because I dohave a hard time finding tank tops withbuilt in bras that aren't actuallysupportive enough to not have to doubleup with another bra I just think thatwearing a sports bra is the unnecessaryhassle when I could just buy a littleLululemon tank top and that's goodenough so as you can see this is arecent tank top and this one has a shelfbra and it also has removable pads thisis the cardio kick tank it didn't sellvery well but I really find this one tobe so functional because it's like aheavy-duty broths really supportive andI can actually do high impact activitieslike running in this one SIA has thismesh material which is more breathableand then almost all Lululemon tank topsalso have a pocket in the back and whenI'm running I just put my keys andstudent ID in there and it's just sohandy cuz I don't need to hold anythingwhen I run actually really like thiswhen I bought itAnthony colors thismy favorite of the three I really likepink here's the one with some colorblocking this in terms of style is oneof my favorite things to be careful whenbuying Lululemon because some other tanktops especially the ones at roost roostbus area tend to emphasize that area toomuch just has a small shelf bra but itdoesn't have this one anyway it doesn'thave a lot of support and this one'smore of a cotton material so actually Ijust wear this as a pajama this one doestend to show a lot of cleavage so ox Idon't wear this one dre often exceptwhen I'm marching around studying andthis one like also a lot of Tanks youcan modify the straps to criss cross inthe backnow this of all my Lululemon tank topshas to be my favorite style this iscalled the the light-up or speed up tankand this one it's just I even took thecups out I don't want to wear them butit has so much support as the bestsupport of all my Lululemon tank topsand it has these thick bands the mesh inthe back and zip pocket it also has thiselastic band on the inside to help stickto your body this is definitely I thinkone of the most functional and cutesttops I haveI bought it in this gray color too andthis one's even better it has thisreflective panel on the tank straps thisis probably the oldest style I have Ithink this is called the aje tankactually really like a lot of the olderpatterns are not so fond of the new onesand I also have it in this senorita pinkyeah this is this is probably the oldestthey have I think this one's made inCanada now they are usually made in itin Asian countriesI guess I'll show the pan snakes sinceit's what I have the second most ofthese I heat it up crops just prettystandarda lot of people criticize Lululemon forbeing see-through but I either and Ihaven't observed it well enough or itisn't that much of a problemI tried testing out a couple pants Ihave and I I don't think that this IIIwas that big of an issue these theselike the heated up shorts for hot yogaand I'm not sure now wahoo I bought themI think I just also wear these when I'mstudying by myself like I don't actuallyI just can't see wearing but I'm gonnatake a class now this is another thing Ibought recently and I really like pink Ithought they were pink in the store butactually yeah they're really OrangeI don't might get these away I'm notparticularly fond of them this is minethis is my favorite Lululemon pant if Icalled the austral pants and they have amedium to high waistband you can alsomodify the waist I can lower it byfolding this down which it adjusts andthese I really like because thematerials the girder them a lot of theother pants and it's really soft it justhas a more luxurious feel and I haven'tshown you yet but here's a tag the tagsare absolutely perforated and you canremove them really easily no here are Ithink these are called they'reuninspired 2.0these are really popular you'll probablyrecognize them from this bottom part ofall the Lululemon pants I have this isthe only one I noticed was the littleShira I squat so also this myth thismaterial is noticeably different fromthe Astro pants it's a lot thinner andit's not very soft so I wouldn'trepurchase these it does have a pocketthough they pretty much all have pocketsthough other item I do like fromLululemon are the pull overs this is therise and shine I think this is made fromruler on it's just of everything I ownLululemon this is the softest fabric andit's it doesn't look like it but it isso light it's pretty sheer I actuallyhave gone running in it it's reallylight and like most all the pullovers itdoes have a thumb hole which I actuallyreally like the thumb holes because Iride my bicycle to class and I wasnoticing that my hands were gettingreally Terran compared to my arm so justhaving this covering my hand just isreally helpful in itselfhere's another sweatshirt this one has alot of ruching it's really attractiveshortsI have a few shorts from Lululemon thisis their best seller I highly recommendthese these are calledsome speed shorts they're a little shortbut look it's so ingenious they made thefront shorter than the back that way itcovers your above and also they havethese vents on the side can you see thatit opens up here it's event foradditional circulation and as a standardpocket there's actually vents all alongthe back and for me I'm five foot fiveand I don't think they look that shorton me anyway if you're taller it couldrestrict some movement these um juststandard like spandex type shorts I justlike to wear them really only underneathskirts when I ride my bike to classthat's the only time I wear those and Ialso run in these these are like dolphinshorts this one actually it doesn't havea pocket in the back but they put apocket on the inside small one so thenthey always pay attention to detail andthis is I think it's called gravy runshort hope you can see this is prettystandard it's comfortable it has a builtin lining and it has a draw string cordon the endit's actually gonna compare these twothe zealot shorts I have see thesefellows shorts these are a medium butthey're just slightly too large also thezealous have no pocket on the back itdoes have these side pockets but theproblem with them is every time I woreevery time I wear these whatever theactivity the pockets flip out whichreally gets in the way I don't want herto worry about that one exercising alsothere's a drawstring cord but has theseloose ends it's just not as neat as theLululemon and the fabric is totallydifferent it's it's not asit's lines still keep his silky feelingum he feels rougher it's also thinnerand the thing about these shortsI thought was bizarre it has these likedirtsthere it's not dirt but after I took himfrom the laundryhe got these spots on them and I told mymom about it and she said she actuallyhas them on her shorts tooso it's not just from the communallaundry it's something about the shortsso they're really the last type of itemI buy from Lululemon are the the bras Ijust have a couple for when I wearshirts like like this one I do reallylike the t-shirts this one I bought justreally because it's supposed to give alot of support and I like the backstraps this is called the energy bro I'mnot sure you can see there we goas these crisscross straps in the backand I think is anything special in shortI just like the way that the straps lookI would not be purchased this I actuallydo like the gsella wallet ones ellebrabut that one gives more support for me Ipretty much nowadays I just don't evenlike I said I don't buy sports bras Ijust invest in getting tank tops withbuilt in bras this one I I did buyrecently this is the heated up bra and Ibought this for for hot yoga because ithas it has this front clasp you know andyou guys so hot and sticky and it's justso difficultto take your top off it's just so handythat this month unlocks from the frontand this is by far in my opinion thebest bra that Lululemon makes if you'rea larger chested this one you shouldtake a look at because as thickadjustable straps most Lululemon brasdo not have adjustable straps and italso has three different places to hookand it has three hooks this is calledthe tata tamer and they make it in sizes32 to 38 from cups C to e so this one isby far it has the most support you coulddo any activity and I also receive thisas a gift but in a 34 because Lululemondoes run kind of small they thought 34would fit better but actually I had toexchange it for my actual size of 32which shows to me in a way that this bradoes run true-to-sizereally the last thing I have someLululemon are some socks I tried thesebefore the women's run for Sun I waslooking for some really super sheer thinsocks so these ones these ones arereally good for that if you need superthin socks that feel like you're noteven wearing any speaking I'm notwearing any also like the the underwearthe I'll say here which I knew I likedtoobut I bought like 20 pairs of them thissummer and I bought them because thereyou cannot see them when you wear yogapantsthere is no penny I highly recommendthose underwear actually I like themjust as much as the little upper tanktops this is their best-selling headbandum it's the best headband I've evertried it's really great for a hot yogaactually it does keep all your hair inplaceI don't wear headbands often but if youneed oneto keep sweat out of your eyes and hairout of your face this is this isprobably the best headband,26,UCvaslozYkHmrCU-vUaXZ9SQ,Christine Le,30,15,0,248,"['activewear try on', 'activewear try on haul', 'leggings try on', 'activewear haul', 'activewear

well hellowelcome to my channel welcome back ifit's not your first timetoday we're going to be talking aboutthe famous lululemon and lion collectionincluding the shortsleggings the tank we're gonna go overthe good stuffthe bad stuff and most importantly is itworth itlet's get into it[Music]so the lululemon align collection ismade from their new fabricwhich as you see in the close-up is thisbrushsuper buttery soft material and yes iknowthese days every company has the likebrush buttery soft but these are the ogsso we'll start off with the shorts theseare the six inch shorts this is theblackum so when i wanted to try out theirshorts i decided to go for this colorbecause it'sneutral it goes with everything and iwasn't really sure aboutwhat length would look the best of mebut theseare 100 the right choicei find that for me personally that fourto six inchinstant range is like a sweet spotbecause anything shorterand exposureanything longer it just cuts me offso these are really lovely um they havethisdouble lined waistband compared to therestof the legging which has thisnaturally tapered shape now the thingabout this isit gives you that nice snatch look butbecause of the waythe material is it also offers youminimal to no compression so if you'relooking for goodcomfortable all day type of leggingsthisis your best bet now in the back you seealong with their very minimal brandingthe seamsalso come downwards into a pointbecause what that does is it shapes yourglutes andit's super flattering when you breatheon the front down the center you see ithas that front seam and usually thefront seamis a dreaded thing a women's active wearbutthis is actually just fine i don't haveany problems with it whatsoeverthe other thing about the align bottomsis they all come with thesepockets on the inside of the waistbandat the frontnow it doesn't really fit that much ikind of you can't fit any phone in thereanything butif you have like keys or somethingmaybe a credit card okay so i lovethose black 16 shorts so much i wentbackand i got a second pair this time inthispretty burgundy color you see in theclose-upit's called cases on their website and iwasn't sure what that was so i looked itup and apparently it's black currantbut it's really gorgeous i think itlooks really well on my skin tone aswellit's exactly the same as the other sixinch shorts just in a different colorokay next we're going to talk about theleggings nowon their website lululemon offers awhole range of different legging lengthsdepending on what you're looking for sowe're going to start with the 21 inchin construction they're pretty muchexactly the same as the shorts they'rejust longerthese ones come up to about mid car forme i'm only 5.3the rest of my measurements and sizingwill all be in the description box belowum most of the stuff from lululemon isin a size two for methat's my regular sizing and that'samerican sizing soif you're from somewhere else you mayhave to like do a quick conversionbefore you buyi really like them for kind of when theweather is kind of in betweenyou know when it's not too cold not toowarm because the material like i saidbefore is quite lightweight so you get anice goodair and but it still somehow might justkeep you warm when you need itnow the main reason i actually got thisis becausei saw the print and i just fell in lovewith it and ilooked at it in every single leg inlength and these were the only onesthat still had my size it's called thewildformation camo and the black color allright sonext legging length we have the 25 inchagain it's the same as bottoms beforebut this one comes up right up to theankle for me so this is my full lengthsize in the lemon againwith this one i was drawn to the colorthis is that samewild formation camo but in brown earthi'm really loving the browns these daysi think it's mostly because i finallyhave so many different options for youfor my skin toneso i'm incredibly drawn to it the thingabout these onesis these are actually a size zero whichis a size down from my usual sizebut because of just how stretchy thematerial isit fits just fine a tiny little bit moresnugthrough the legs but nothing that's toobad to where i can't manage itokay the final legging length we haveare the28 inches now these ones come upsuper long on me they bunch at thebottomas you see but ireally like the color anyway and at thetime i got it i wasn't surejust how long it would come up i don'tmind it because it works for the coldlike it's easy super easy to tuck theseones into socksand keep yourself nice and toasty againexactly the same asall the other bottoms before in exactlythe same color as one of my otheralliance shellsthat gorgeous burgundy casey's coloragainall right next we move into the aligntanks now theseare some of the most popular activewearitemto be released in a while every timelemonuploads these they sell so quicklyso these are the first ones i got thisis themin their ancient copper i think it'scalled it's this really prettylight brown again i was drawn to thebrownsand by the time i saw this because ofhow quickly it sells outthe smaller size left was a size fourwhich this isum it doesn't it doesn't come up too badon me it's just a tiny little bit baggyat the bottom butagain not anything i can't work withthese are great because they come inwith this built-in barwith removable cup pads if that's notfor youit's a great two in one piece okay so ilikedthe first align tank i got so much iwent backand i got another one this time i wasable to snag it in myregular size two these are then in theblackit's in exactly the same as the othercolorjust in one neutral shade so i can wearit with anythingokay now we've gone through the wholecollection i've mentioned some goodstuffabout how they provide minimal to lowcompression so they're good for all dayloungingbut they still keep you snatched theycling to every single curvewithout being too suffocating they'rereally good leggingsbut they're not perfect they do havedownsidesfirst thing the most notable thingthe price now the alliance tanks and thealliance shorts for me are not too badin my opinion as somebody who shops alittle activewear for two in one tankand for cycling shorts the price ispretty much about the same as most otherbrands but when it comes to the leggingsthat's where it starts to get a bitsteep now what i do isusually when i'm looking to buy a newpair i go on to thewomen's section and go into the we madetoo muchpart of it and they always have goodcolorsand different patterns at really gooddiscounts so if you're looking to startup your collectionthat is a great place to lookokay next thing about these is and thismight shock you considering the pricesbut they can't be quite prone to pillingso you know when you get thosetiny little bubbles on the top of yourfabricnow there are a few ways to avoid this ifound that worked for mefirstly these are made to beleggings for super low impact workoutsso for like yogaand pilates or lounging which is what ido and then mostlyso i wouldn't do anything to high impactin it because if you doincreases the chances of friction whichwill definitely give you peelingespecially on the inner thighs thesecond thingis with when it comes time to wash themwhat i do is i turn them inside outi run the sink with some cold watermild detergent and i wash them in thesink and then hang them up to dryand that keeps them going for muchlonger okay your next question might bewhat happens if you get pilling anywaynow that's where this comes in this isone of myfavorite purchases i made this year thisis the pillari got it on amazon i'll drop the link inthe description box below if you'relooking to get yourself oneit's super gentle on the fabric it takesupevery single one like it gets everysingle one of themand leaves it looking brand new no thisis the sponsor i justabsolutely love it when it first came ini wasn't surebut i tried it out and no looking backthey literally just need two double-abatteries in the back andyou're good to go okay so last bitof our review is it worth itnow for me personally i say yes i thinkmostly because i get a lot ofstuff in the discounted section on theirwebsite so it's not toopricey and i really love havinggo-to clothes for when i know i'm gonnabe out all day running errandsback when they could be out all dayrunning errandsbut or like even just at home all daylounging especiallyspecific times of the month but alsoreally great if you're into your yogaand bloodypractice so if you're that type ofperson i would say yes definitely go foritbut if you're not then this is an easyskip becauseit's not really that much of amulti-purpose again because you do haveto bea little bit more careful with them okayso that's all i have for today's videothank you so much for watching pleaselikeshare subscribe watch my other videosand come back for more fun stuff i'vegot some more good stuff on the

these are better than the Lululemonwonder under there is quite a bit ofspillage going on okay so I wasimpressed at the moment I put these onit really not winning me over on thesports bras she is lifted guys I finallydid itgiving myself a whole internal round ofapplause for finally doing a reviewthat's so so requested would really likelast year like November Decemberflashback to better times I was tellingall of you guys Petula it's gonna be myfirst review of the new year like it'slike the number what am i list we'regonna do it and like it was the numberone on my list but for some reason likethings just pile up and I get so manyother things to do and it's now Marchand we're finally doing the review stillwithin the first quarter of the year soI'll call it a win but we are reviewingPetula today also I have some teabecause it's a little cold outside andyou might be spilling fun anyways it istime for a Petula review so a coupleweeks ago they posted about having a 30%off everything sale and I was like youknow what if I'm not gonna do the reviewnow I'm never gonna do it so I boughtfrom the sale the sale was actually at 7a.m. my time so I did actually a coupleearly for it and then like a lothappened in the sale actually didn't golive until 7 o 8 but like I have to getready for class so like I went about mybusiness and I didn't get back on thesite until like 7 12 because after likesix minutes of refreshing the page andnot seeing the sale prices I was gettinga little annoyed so we just took a breakand then I came back I like 712 andthings were on sale and I think like oneof my things had sold out but like noteverything sold out really quickly butit just was a little stressful because Iwoke up early for it and then it didn'thappen I knew people would be active onInstagram at this time so I went totheir page and they actually posted likeat 7 a.m. the sale was live even thoughit wasn't they were like a millioncomments for people being like actuallythe sales not livelots of people actually bought and justassumed that the sale would be likealready processed it wasn't so my heartgoes out to those people I hope you gotyour sale prices I got two sports bras 3pairs of leggings and a top I heard frommost people that the best leggings arethe Taylor steak true which just soundslike a Taylor Swift song to me soobviously I'm here for it and I also gotthe Elena's correct me if I'm wrong butI think someone told me to be aligned assupposed to be kind of like Lululemonaligned oops hence the very close namelike they really want trying to be sad alittle and the Taylor steak fruits aresupposed to be like a wonder under sowithout further ado let's get into italso we have peach here she likes to siton my laptop and prevent me from doingstuff so so first I have the align oftwos and I got these in a 23 inch whichI believe is like a mid-calf crop I dolike how they have like the actual inchmeasurements of all their leggings andthey do have like 23 inch which is cropI guess 25 which i think is like 7/8 andI think 28 is a full length I do usuallylike at least a 7/8 I prefer a fulllength because I am very tall I'm 5 9but these were the only ones I could getin the elena's so I'm just gonna likejudge them based on you know how theyfit in the feel and everything and notthe actual length because I don't likemid-calf leggings because my calves aregiant so they don't really like to beconstricted anyways I bought these for$46 they're originally 65 they come insize extra extra small to extraextra-large so very good size rating forthese they have a high waist a four-waystretch and it says a super soft cottonyfeel these do feel super soft but I haveopened up all of the leggings at thispoint and I would say that these are theonly soft of the three but that's likereally not saying much they're stilllike almost like super soft they areslightly brush but they're really notfuzzy at all I would say they're softbut I wouldn't expect a lot of fuzzieslintand I wouldn't really expect a whole lotof pilling on these they're definitelyless brushed than a Lululemon the linethis is part of their performancecollection which I have to say giventhat the fabric is like the leastbrushed of the three I would agree withthat and on their Instagram theyactually have like a little leggingcomparison chart which just makes mylife so easy but anyways they say thesehave a high waist minimal compressionmedium softness and medium stretch andit also recommends the activities thatit's best for so I will put that upthese do have a slightly taperedwaistband that usually helps withkeeping the leggings up they don't haveany seam at the top so you shouldn'thave anything cut into the muffin topregion and they do have an extendedgusset crotch okay so I was impressed atthe moment I put these on I think thefabric is a perfect balance of beingreally really soft to the touch withoutbeing so brushthat's gonna collect a lot of lint andreally easily pill the waistband feelsso nice it's the perfect height itdefinitely is a highway so it goes alittle bit about my bellybutton and thewaistband in the back is a little bitlonger in the middle so you don't havethat like awkward kind of like you knowa little like Halfmoon like you knowabove your butt or kind of pulls it downmore these just literally look totallysmooth and flawless they're like a supersuper nice basic they are also superflattering on the booty I didn't evenhave to hide these up and the seams aregoing above my booty you always wantyour seams on your leggings to not cutoff like in the middle of your buttbecause that just cuts off your likeline of your butt it just makes it looksmaller look we want to maximize ourbooties I say these around like thismidea spit on the bigger side so ifyou're in between I would size down butI would say go with your normal size Ido normally wear a small about a six andLululemon and these are small and Ithink that these are perfect for methere's just like a tiny bit of roomlike a little bit around here when Imove a certain way and the waistbandcould be like the tiniest bit tighterbut it's not like loose I would saythese are a light to medium compressionI wouldn't even say they're mediumcompression honestly they don't feellike really compressive at allthey are super stretchy like I can moveand I'm not feeling any tightness I'dsay that these would probably be mediumstudy light friendly I wouldn't expectthem to hide all the cellulite it'sdefinitely thicker than a little limitof mine but it's still pretty thin cameltoes aren't really an issue for me itdoes have the extended gets it crotchthis is the 23 inch and it honestly kindof feels like a 7/8 length on me but Idon't knowI wouldn't expect these to be entirelysweat proof but these probably are alittle more sweat proof than the othertwo leggings but you know we're allalike I mean I don't really haveanything wrong with these it'sdefinitely nice that I got them like forthe $40 range they are usually $60 buthonestly these feel like super highquality and they feel super nice I'm notmad at them oh yeah and I would givethese a medium to high on the bootyscale they are pretty nice[Music]next we have the Taylor stay true maybenot to remind me of the song like staybeautiful I want to sing it right nowbut honestly like you do would probablydo monetize me for that because theywill t monetize anything they can'tthese I also bought for $46 but theoriginal price is 65 these say the onlycomment size extra small to extra largeso I don't know if they were like soldout in like the bigger sizes and thesmaller sizes or if some leggings don'tcome in the same size range they saythat this is their best selling classicdesign it is a mid rise which I'm alittle nervous about and I'm hopingmaybe I could like you know at leastkind of hike it up a little bit to be ahigh rise this color is absolutelystunning this is the Arizona sunset andI have to say after opening up all theleggings these definitely feel likethey're gonna be my favorite the fabricis like super super soft but it's alsofeeling like a little bit thinner thanthe next leggings we're gonna try it'sdefinitely more brushed than thealignersthis is a brushed polyalloy same fabricit is part of their lounge collectionthese have minimal compression maxsoftness and max stretch so that kind ofsounds like a dream to me that soundsmore aligned like to meet aligns Iusually think of like you're notcompressive at all but like superstretchy deeper soft so I'm so excitedthis waistband definitely seems shorterthan the illini waistband it also stillhas a little bit of a taper seamless atthe top and these do also have theextended gusset crotch just showing youthe waistband height really quickly thisthe greys are the aligners and I'velined up these seams right here but thetailor state rows are definitely a solidlike a centimeter less it's not reallythat much shorter but it does like looka lot shorter okay I like literallycan't get over how soft this fabricfeels I hope you can see it is brushedand it's also just like super super softand stretchy so I literally wasspeechless putting these on they feellike the most buttery soft luxuriousleggings I've ever put on but I amhaving a little issue with camel becausethese are a medium rise I'm like I justfeel like I'm kind of trying to pullthem up a little bit because I do liketo have my leggings cover up to acertain region of my waist but someleggings you can pull them up alland you won't have an issue with camelother like eggs you can pull them up andthey do have an issue I employed a fewof my camel toe tricks so hopefully it'sstill PG also if you want to know mybest legging tax if you literally searchlegging hacks into YouTube I'm the firstperson who comes up anyways these arequite literally incredible I mean youcould just see how form-fitting andhugging these are these I can alreadysay I like them way better than thealignersso you can definitely see if the waistis a little bit lower the Alliance wentabout a centimeter above my belly buttonand these go kind of like right belowthey still do have a seamless waist thewaist band itself has about a mediumcompression in the leggings I'd say alight to medium compression these are sosoft I love them so much and I just feellike they're hugging like all the rightplaces the booty teams are also curvingaround my butt it's really like thesemight be a high on the booty scale it'salso like hugging like you know thispart of my butt to which is like reallylifting up I just feel like my booty islifted right no guys she is lifted theseare quite thin and snug so youdefinitely will have an issue hidingpanty lines but that's also in mylighting tech video I'm wearing aseamless thong and you can see it justlike the tiniest bit but it's not a hugeissue I don't go commando my leggingsthat seems get places where theyshouldn't beso these definitely have more hold tothem than a Lululemon align probablymedium cellulite friendly I wouldn'texpect them to be entirely celluliteproof and to these probably would showsweat a little bit as well I definitelywould do all of my regular workouts inthese they don't feel so brushed thatit's just gonna pill all over the placeit's honestly just like a very lightbrush these definitely feel more snugthan the aligners so I would say size upif you're in between in the tailor statetruth be 28 inch is totally full-lengthon me so it's a somewhat full length anddoes that make sense a crash I'm justgonna go ahead and say itthese are better than the Lululemonwonder under little hundred wonderunders do not have this booty seam andthey do not do this to my butt alrightthese are also super super stretchy andnot restricting at all I think these arekeeper guys I will be listening toexclusively Taylor Swift music whileworking out in these don't you worryokay in the middle of an at-home workoutbut I was just doing some banditsstuff and these definitely do not likebands I'm not sure if there's like anyactual damage to the leggings but theydefinitely have fuzzies coming off sokeep in mindnext we have the Danielle Lux leggingsand no one recommended these to me butyou can't throw Lux in the name of alegging and like and not have me try itI got these for $43 but originally theyare 62 these come in size extra small toextra extra-large they have a mediumcompression medium stretch and maxsoftness these do you feel like the mostbrush of all three of the leggings butdefinitely just like holding them in myhand they definitely have a little morestructure to them than the tailor stateruse so I could see how they have like alittle more compression and a littleless stretch these also have the samehigh waistband slightly tapered at thetop no seam and it seems like all oftheir leggings have an extended gothiccrotch so camel toe is it an issue we'llsee here's the Danielle Lux leggingfabric hopefully you can see it ispretty brushed and I have to say while Ilike them I think they're my leastfavorite of the three they're soft andbrushed just like the Taylor's but theydo feel a little bit stiffer and theyjust don't quite have as much stretch tothem and I like my leggings to be supersuper stretchy these ones I would giveabout a medium compression so they'redefinitely more compressive the waist isa little higher so I do like that andwhile I still feel like I can do a lotin them I definitely feel just like alittle bit more tightness especiallylike in the knee area so yeah but theseare a little higher waisted not quite ashigh as the aline --is not really anycamel toe here the seams basically goabove my butt maybe a little less highthan the other ones or maybe becausethese are a little bit more tight Ican't pull them up quite as high whileall of these fabrics are brushed they'renot attracting as much lint as like theAlpha Li alpha luxe leggings got likeliterally you could be within 10 feet ofa cat and get cat fur these ones I'mfinding that it's actually not like ahuge issueI'm definitely getting some Lynch likedon't get me wrong but it's not asextreme as some these are the 26 inchand they are a 7/8 length and I wouldsay that this is a pretty true 78 theseones will probably be more site lightfriendly than the other two because theydo feel a little more thick a littlemore concealing these would probablyshow sweat I think these ones would begood if you're looking for a little morecompression and you still want to feellike a super soft legging but there areleggings out there that I prefer morethat have compression and just a littlebit more stretch so if yous are just alittle bitlocking for me couple old stringy guysbut you kind of happens these onesthere's no loose material anywherebesides small that's fitting perfectlyso I would definitely go true to size ifyou're in between I would size up justbecause of the compression and a littlebit less stretching this fence up I givethese a medium maybe a medium to high onthe booty scale they're still honestlylike pretty flattering[Music]also I would like to take a briefintermission have everyone look at mynew wallpaper this is peach sitting likean absolute weirdo this is also a greattime to say if you're still watchingplease give the video a thumbs up andsubscribe not for me but also for peachbecause she loves her pants next we havethe Bree number 2 cool sleek tank I gotit for $20 it's originally 29 so it ispretty affordable it comes in size extrasmall to extra extra largeit's a poly lycra blend it basicallyjust has a little scoop neck with aracerback in the back says unite and ithas the little Tula leaf logo on theback and here's the fabric it's kind ofthat little like ribbed material superlightweight kind of cool feeling not themost like luxurious feeling fabric inthe world but if you're looking forlight weight it's probably lately ok sohere's the top it's actually quite niceI kind of shame the fabric a little bitbut I kind of love it it feels supersuper lightweight and just like hugs andall the right places I did I am wearinga size small so you could size up if youwant it to be a looser fit but I kind ofthink that it's like tight in the rightplaces and just kind of flares out alittle bit along the bottom here it istight and most of the back as well againI saw some people like tied these topsand because it's a little looser andit's super stretchy I think you coulddefinitely tie itI've always liked tying my stuff becausethen if you ever like lie down on yourstomach I don't know what I do at thegym I'm lying down on my stomach but ifyou do it gets in the way it'sdefinitely a light weight so I wouldwear it more seamless sports bra thatyou can't see any of these lines but ohyeah it's pretty nice it's my $29 I gotit for $20 obviously for $20 I might aswell keep it like I don't really have alot of tank topswell Tula thank you for thisnext we have the Veronica embrace sportsbra in lily-white I bought this for $22but the original price is 34 it comes insize extra small to extra extra large ithas a nice like plunging deep v lookedreally cute on the models I hope thatthis is good because I do have a biggerchest so I don't really want to be likeyou know out there all the time but Ialways like classic white sports bras sohopefully this fabric is definitely notbrushed it feels like more performancematerial but it's not the shiny kind isstill very matte maybe kind of like aLululemon luan it has a little Petulalogo in the back their logos are allrubberized so they definitely like staleand better than like a crappy old gymshark logo nothing against gym shark butthey need to up their logo game in theback is super cute it's a littlecrisscross E style the bottom strap is alittle thin so I hope it has enoughsupport and it also has removable cuppads ok so here is the Veronica embracesports bra let me just say I don't quitefeel embraced I was a little ambitiousthat this sports bra I should have seenthis coming it's really my fault but thegirls are out so if you have biggergirls this sports bra isn't for youwhich I'm so upset because all I want isto wear a nice plunging V and have it becute and have a lot of coverage and it'sjust it's not happening from you todayso if you are a smaller cap girl pleasejust go ahead and wear this for metag me in your pics you know I want tosee it it's cleavage but I'm notspilling out the sports part really isstunningit actually has like a solid mediumsupport even in my current state themain issue I think is a side boob thereis quite a bit of spillage going on soit's not quite ideal for me the cup padsare actually pretty good they're reallynot super visible teeny bit visible justbecause it is a white sports bra theyfeel pretty high-quality for a cup passit still does fit me really well at thebottom of the bra be honest I would saythat these are true to size I don'tthink that sizing up would work for mein this case because often times when Isize up in bras I have less coverage itends up just gaping in the waistband andbeing worse so here's the back thoughit's super cute super strappy definitelyvery open and lightweight but yeah nicefourth graph just notanyone with meteor girls[Music]and lastly we have the Sevilla Oliviasports bra and dusted periwinkle andthis is one of my favorite colors of alltime I remember when I was a kid I usedto say my favorite color was periwinklesimply because periwinkle was a coolword but look at me now I actually likedit I also bought this for twenty twodollars and the original price was 32 itcomes in size extra small to extra largeand I say it has a light to moderatesupport moderate coverage removable cutpads and it's in their performancecollection well I think that this couldbe a performance bra for some peoplelike I definitely wouldn't see this andbe like oh that's a running broth justbecause I have like a bigger cup sizeand if I want to like be running like Ireally need to be like squished down butit is super cute it does have a littlescoop neck in the front it does haveremovable cut pads the straps in theback not only crisscross but I kind oflike come together and do something alittle fun so yeah and the Petula logois in the middle at the back here okayso I have to say they're really notwinning me over on the sports bras thesewere kind of the two main sports for usever on their website I didn't see a lotthat looked like they had a lot moresupport or coverage and neither of themare really working for a larger cup sizeso well they definitely won me over onthe leggings I'd like to see a littlemore than the sports for us yeah I likeit and it's okay the fabric is not myfavorite it's a little bit scratchy Iwouldn't say it's like super scratchybut just compared to how soft yourleggings are I would like it to be alittle bit softer it's pretty similarand feel to the Veronica sports bra butbecause it has this these seams aroundthe outside they just are making it likea little bit each year so again thisfits really well along the bra bandregion but this bra just doesn't have alot of like overall space to actuallylike hole to the girls you know so ifyou have a bigger cup size there'sreally just not a whole lot of room forthem so obviously it's a pretty scoopedneck we do have a little cleavage hereprobably won't be too much of an issueif you are a smaller cup size and againthere is some side boob and I just feellike it's a little bit itchyI would definitely size up if you're inbetween on the sports bras especiallythis one does feel just like a teeny bittight I don't think I could size upthough cuz I don't know with myexperience with medium sports bras ifthey fit me worse than smalls in termsof support it's actually a solid mediumsupportnot like jiggling around we didn't takea train to jiggle City today also theback of the sports bra is really cuteit's definitely like a little em'ly deskbut like isn't everything these daysI am definitely impressed with thesupport of a sports bra given that itdoes have kind of like thinner strappyback kind of thing let me know in thecomments down below if you haveparticular sports bras how they work foryou because I'd love to hear well I wasabout to say obviously I'm just oneopinion[Music]all right so that's it for the review ifyou made it this far give it a thumbs upand subscribe we got some fun videoscoming so I was super super impressedwith the leggings definitely recommend Ithink the tailor stage freeze if you'reokay with the mid rise those are reallysomething honestly all the leggings werepretty impressiveand the sports bars are cute they'rejust like really not made for us girlsbigger cup sizes so I would like to seethem come out with a little more likemore coverage higher support sports brasfor girls with bigger girls let me knowif you've tried Petula down below andwhat'd you think of them thank you forwatching and I'll see you next time bye,26,UCqOC1SiA6v994Sx_WR1-xew,Kathryn Mueller,114,13,0,1410,"['ptula', 'ptula leggings review', 'ptula leggings', 'ptula try on',

hi I'm Morgan and I'm here with Ben pansloth to talk about Lululemon so I'mMorgan Rabyand the ways I like to workout I loveyoga I call myself a fair-weather runnerI just took a two-hour spin class todayand my butt kind of hurts but that wasfun so I I like to venture out tryanything so how did you get to where youare at today in Lululemon and what yourposition is I started as a seasonaleducator backlast Christmas so last October I startedthere after holiday was done I went onand became part time and then I bumpedthem enough that they let me gofull-time and then after that I am now akey leader which is a step right belowthe assistant managers if you coulddescribe Lululemon's culture what wouldyou say their cultures fun it'sdifferent than anything else I've everexperiencedI love the educator and guestsinteraction I love how unique we canmake our store feel compared toeverywhere else very good what is thebest part about working in theenvironment that I wouldn't be able tosee just walking around in the storeit's definitely the relationships youcan make it's so different how there'snever any drama if you have a problemwith someone you just go right up tothem and tell them what your problem isalso just getting out and sweating inthe community is a way that we like todiffer our selves so that what is thebest part about your jobabout not dreading going in I neverdread going into work and if I dothere's always somebody that I can goand talk to and be like this is why I'mdreading going into workI never feel stressed out about it Ialso like I just said I love that we geta sweat in the community so like againtoday they asked me if I'm go to thisspin class and I just if you tell me gowork out I'll go work out so that'sdefinitely my favorite fine so wementioned three goals are three corevalues of Lululemon and Morgan mentionedentrepreneurship setting goals andsupporting the employees so how do youshowcase these on a daily basis atLululemon well start withentrepreneurship it's definitely you areyour own like business owner so ifyou're back in pants for the day and youdon't like how something is merged orlaid out you have every opportunity inthe world to switch it around you canalso if the guest walks into the storeand they ask if you can if they can seethe manager you are more than you willalmost get in trouble if you don't saythat you're the manager and that you canhelp them so basically you're your ownmanager and you can help guests with anyproblem you can do whatever you see fitfor the store whatever's going to helpthe store in the long run and then goalsour store or just Lululemon in generalis so they love goals basically I wouldalways say we have a high turnover rightbecause people come into the store towork and you're told you're giving likecoaching to do your goals and that'sjust bizarre and people don't even knowlike we're gonna be in five years Idon't know so it almost gets you tothink about it and it's scary but youfigure out what you want to do and howthebut he can support you and no one isever gonna like not how you just becauseyou're like oh I want to move to Texasin a year and then they would definitelyhire you if you're gonna support thecompany no matter what so and then thelast one supporting what you wanted todo oh yeah so like what I just said Imean the company is all for seeing yougrow in your life wherever you want togo whether it be with the company or ifnot it's it can be a stepping stone intosomething different it can be a steppingstone into a different position thecompany is just there to support youmaybe the love so is that what makesLululemon different ordefinitely that's what makes a littleoven different is the goals and theculture but one of my favorite partsthat makes it different is just theexperience that you get walking into thestore and like we want to know what yourname is we want to know what you like todo to work out we want to know what theheck you're doing todayso like you walk into target and Ialmost get sad now when people don'twant to know what I'm doing for the dayor what what am I out shopping for orwhat do I like to do work out so Idefinitely say that in-store experienceis one of the biggest differences alsowe have just this last week last Mondaytwo designers came down from Vancouverto Omaha Nebraska and we had breakfastwith them it was the head design forwomen's yoga and then it was also thehead design for the new on the go or nowhat's it called yeah something like onthe go and so they came from Vancouverto Omaha to hear what we had to say sothey wanted to know what do you guyswant for next spring and we were likePearlie you're asking us this so that'sdefinitely what makes the companydifferent too is you can talk to anybodyabout anything and one of the girls thatwe had breakfast with one of myco-workers she was like I want your joband how didyou get there and what can I do to getyour job so we're very open abouteverything and as it doesn't the twobiggest differences company so if therewas one thing that you could changeabout Lululemon what would that be um Imean the one thing I would change Idon't really like the cold so I wouldmove the SSC or the like headquarterssomewhere warmer so I could work there Imean I don't know it's such a coolcompany that I haven't found anythingthat I would want to change yet in allhonesty it just keeps growing andexpanding and I mean we're opening ourfirst store and London this month so Ifeel like everything is just on theup-and-up and I don't think I'd

okay so the next part is my Lululemonhaul and I bought a ton of stuff fromLululemon and this is like the main partof this video and a lot of my friendswho don't watch my videos they ask meDaisy why do you love Lululemon so muchlike it's a expensive brand like why doyou like it so much now I have so manytheories on it so the first serie is aLululemon fits my body type really wellso there are some companies and brandsthat fit my body type well for exampleBB and Lululemon brands that do not fitmy body type well are like Zara and H&MI feel like a Zara girls are more likevery skinny girls with a particular bodyshape because every time I go to H&M orZara I just feel so fat and I feel likethe clothing is so unflatteringwhereas if I go to be B or Lululemon Ifeel like where they hug and where theyemphasize is really flattering on me soI feel like Lululemon looks really welland girls who are fit athletic have alittle bit of you know meat on theirbodies and have more of a curve to theirbodiesI don't think Lululemon really makes adifference for girls who are real thinor who don't have like muscular framessimply because they're not going toemphasize what you want them toemphasize so Lululemon lament thatLululemon items just fit at the smallestpart of their waist their jackets theirjackets their shirtswhatever just hugs my waist great andthen it kind of curves out so the largerpart of your stomach doesn't show andthen also their pants I love theirgroove pants I have like four pairs ofthem and the reason is it just fits mybutt really well I just don't know howto explain itI have larger thighs like a higher but Iguess and it just it falls perfectly onthere with other brands for example likeZara jeans it just it doesn't fit mythighs I doesn't fit my butt I can't Ido not need to dress a certain way sousually I could even wear pajamas towork but I will usually just wear aLululemon to work and I also work outeverysingle day and because of that kind oflifestyle we was running around runningerrands I'm not sitting in a cubicle I'mrunning a lot of errands when I work andI go to the gym every single day soLululemon is the best for my lifestylewhen I travel I wear Lululemon all thetimewhen I go to sleep I wear Lululemon mostof the time I don't wear like normalsleep wear I wear Lululemon because it'sjust so comfortable and yeah I think thecut of their clothing is really whatseparates it from a lot of other brandsand even their sweatshirts like theirscuba hoodies and their jackets theycould they fit to a woman's body they'renot like baggy baggy a sweatshirt theyactually fit and conform to yourwaistline so little details like that Ithink make Lululemon worth the price forme and every time I get a piece ofLululemon item clothing I never regretit I end up wearing it all the time andI neglect all my other brands ofclothing because I just continuouslywear a Lululemon so that kind of givesyou that it was like a three minute ranton that but I wanted to share with youguys some things I got from there sothis is one of their like Christmas bagsand they always come with one of theselike reusable totes because you arepaying for like $100 yoga pants so thefirst thing I got are these pants andactually wear them to the gym so theykind of smell bad they're just theselike like cinched high-waisted anotheryoga pants athletic pants so you can seehow the seam it goes lower on the buttso it makes the butt look nice and thenum the insignia is right here now I lovehigh-waisted yoga pants or just pants ingeneral because when you're working outand you're in downward dog you do notwant your pants to slip down I find thata little lemon yoga pants are activewhere it does not slip down and I've Iwear things from like fabletics or otherbrands I constantly have to pull them upand maybe it's justLululemon fits better to my body andmaybe it's the way it's cut I don't knowbut I've never had a complainwith the Lululemon pants working out andthen I got this jacket now this is arepeat purchase so I have if you bookedIves uh-huh I've done a whole collectionor review of Lululemon items and if youhaven't seen that I will link that belowbut my mother Studio City jacket fromLululemonis seriously one of my favoritepurchases it is up there with this - orWeitzman Highlands and you know andthings I'm obsessed with that jacket theStudio City jacket I wear all thefreaking time and I get compliments on ajacket it's a very simple zip up hoodiejacket but people compliment me on allthe time when Cale secret life of a bionerd came here she tried it on shereally wanted it you know my mom so mymom came over and then she wore it andthen she never took it off and then shenever gave it back to meand I was gonna ask for it back butshe's always wearing it so I feel badasking for it back so I decided to getmy own jacket and this is what it isit's just I mean it looks really simpleit's just like this I got it in thiskind of olive green color this jacketand it has like it's kind of likestretchy and then like dirt not Jerseywhatever this fabric is in the back it'slike this but seriously this jacket isso darn a flattering on me or anybodyand it's reversible so inside it comeswith like a different like a softerlining here but it's just so so damnflattering on anybody who wears itespecially again if you have that curvymuscular figure because it hugs at thewaist and then right here it just givesyou that nice dip on your back thatemphasizes how like perked up your buttis and how slim your waist is it'samazing and this jacket it is a priceyjacket but I will guarantee you that ifyou get this jacket you will not regretit like it is such an amazing jacketwhen I had my old jacket the Navy one Imy trips to Europe I were to like Hawaiiwhere to everywhere and it's perfect forjust LA weather because you know whenit's cold or in the early like cold inthe evening like even in the summer inthe winter this is the perfect layeringpiece like so amazing such an amazingjacket oh my god you need to get it thestudio hoodie jacket by Lululemon it'ssold out onlineI think it's sold out everywhere on eBayyou have to pay like 150% of the priceto get this so get it if you can andtheir of wonder unders and I have nevergotten a pair of under wonder wonderunders before because I never thought Icould justify purchasing $100 blackleggings for yoga so I decided to getthis great kind of called the cottonroll down wonder unders I love itbecause it's high-waisted and it'sreally stretchy and I also got it in thecrop ankle-length which is perfectbecause me I'm five five and it goesright down to my ankles so it goes rightdown to my ankles which is like fulllength for a legging so I don't havethem now I have no idea where they whereI was trying to find them before filmingthis video but I will just insert ascreenshot of what it looks like andthey're really comfortable and so yeahthat's my first pair of wonder undersokay so this is a shirt that I have beenwearing in all my videos and it is thisthese long-sleeve so I'm sure you'veguys seen this in so many of my videosthis is the longest sleeve run a switchleety and it looks like this and oh mygod I am obsessed with this shirt I haveit in purple which I have on right hereyou can see right here purple I have Ijust em up so obsessed with these nowthese are again not cheap items but theyjust they just fit your frame so welland they fit theI guess like the waist part and the hipsreally well now I should have gotten asmaller size because I do tend tostretch out a little bit but they'rejust such a great shirt I wear them if Idon't wear the gray one I am wearing thepurple one like I wear them every like Iwear them every single day one of thesecolors and they're just so comfortableso flattering perfect for puttingunderneath a sweatshirt or a jacketperfect for this la weather also whenyou're working out in the gym and thegym is really cold in the wintertimeit's really great to layer one of theseon amazingamazing shirt I really thoughtthese shirts were just like Oh along-sleeve shirtwhat's the big deal but honestly likechanged my life so much so that I wearthis every single day like and all myvlogs all my videos I have this shirt onso I really like that and then I got tothe um let's see the groove pant whichis my first purchase and my favoriteitem of from Lululemon so Holy Grailfashion items for me from Lululemon theStudio City jacket and the groove pantsthey fit my body really well again I'mnot really into wonder unders because Ilike flares on the bottom of my pantsbecause my thighs and butt is a littlebit larger so I like to kind of create aluge enough balance and so I got thiscolor and it's in a Navy shade and hereit is so it's like a dark navy and thena lighter Navy and then in the back it'sjust normalDulli lemon with the the seams in themiddle and just such a great pant againnot cheap but I do where the groovepants as normal pants so when I work outI always wear leggings that are tight atthe bottom I don't want flared pantsworking out because flare pants I feellike it caught and they're like a littlebit too like heavy to wear so I wearthese grocery shopping I wear these toopen houses I wear these to workI just wear this all the time my outfitin this in the winter is basically thestudio city jacket the long-sleeve shirtand these pants that is what I wear ohand my Clark shoes the second to lastthing from Lululemon is this tank top itis I don't know what it's called but itwas actually pretty cheap I think wastwenty nine dollars and it just so wasmy favorite tank top to workout it I youcan tell like this is what I mean by howit contours your bodyso here the waist is like tiny and thenit comes out and then there's a cinchhere and this is the smallest part ofyour waist right where your rib cagesand who doesn't want to emphasize thatwhile working out and then it flares outso your whole tummy you cannot tell soseriously it does really greatcontouring it just fits so well I lovelove love their power wide tankswhatever kind of tank this is and thenrecently I got this workout gym bag fromLululemon so it's this huge ass purplegym bag and I have my water bottle hereI'll take it down huge as a purple gymbag from Lululemon I might to what's inmy gym bag video but yes it you know Iwas trying to hold off getting a gym bagI was thinking like oh my shopping bagor whatever is good enough but I bring alot of stuff to the gym because I dotend to get ready in the gym I reallylike getting ready in my gym because Idon't I don't know I just I don't likemaking a mess at my house so like inthis front pouch I have my curling ironand a bunch of hair sprays and they'reso I needed like a gym bag that I couldorganize all my makeup basically amakeup in beauty products because I dobring a ton of beauty products and likethe way it opens is really nice it is agood gym bag but it is heavy and I thinkthis is a great gym bag to wear whenyou're traveling or like a carry-on baglike the perfect carry-on bag it iscalled the weekender bag and I thinkthey come in different colors I don'tthink the quality is very good becauseit is made out of like a PVC orpolyurethanebut I mean it's cute and it's it doesthe job so that's that you all so muchfor watching if you want to see my therest of my

hey Internet so how appropriate I justgot back from the gym so you'll have toforgive me if I'm a little bit flusteredor flushed in this video because I'veexhausted I am NOT a gym buddy naturallyI really hate the gym but recently Ihave been so good and really active andit's really all down to peer pressurebecause I've actually ended up makingfriends in a gym classthat's near me where I work and I reallyam enjoying it right now I take akettlebell class on Tuesday and Thursdaywhich some of you might call strengthtraining it's basically like lightweight lifting and it's a lot of fun I'mreally enjoying it they play like allthis 80s music and for the first timereally going to the gym I'm reallyseeing a real difference in my body kindof doing that consistently and I justfeel a lot stronger and better and I'mreally liking it even though I actuallyhate the gym so there you goand on Wednesdays in between that I goto yoga and then sometimes at theweekend I go running or hiking so eventhough I have an enormous Lululemoncollection you know there's no doubtingthat I made a whole video on it a whileago and it even grew since then Idecided I needed to add some more piecesyou can see I can barely lift this bagit's so heavy because all my stuff isalways in the wash because I hate doinglaundry and we're gonna wear it whenit's already dirty so you know that's myjustification for going and spending waytoo much money at Lululemon but the realjustification for me always withLululemon has been that their stuff justlasts forever I really like their stuffand they are really having a

black and it's one ofmy most long-standing pieces so theyreally have had this design for a whileand I can see why because it's a reallygood one that is gonna look really niceon a number of body types so I get asize for pretty much all of their piecesif I got a two it would be like KimKardashian tight which I'm not reallyinterested in but I have learned thatyou have to kind of go with kind ofshowing off your body with little lemonpieces you don't want them to be looseso I remember for a while I was gettinga size 6 or 8 in their bottoms because Ijust felt I don't know like I didn'twant it how'd it be tight and revealingand girl like you're just gonna work itwith workout clothes because it will fitso much better in your workout if itactually fits your body instead of beingtoo loose where it's likely to kind ofride up and move around so that is myphilosophy arm there fit so all of thepieces I'm going to show you are allsize form this is a scoop back tank andit's a really gorgeous kind of cranberrypink it's a really pretty on the skin itsays this tight-fitting tank it's notactually that tight was designed to fitlike a second skin as we move throughyoga class I intend to wear

hi everyone abby here so today i'm goingto be reviewing my newest lululemon yogamatand as you can see i got the reversiblematte five millimetersin the colorway black tigerbefore i get started please hit thatsubscribe button and i'm gonna be comingout with a lot more videos soonall right so i'm just gonna go over acouple ofbasic things about this mat um for oneit was purchased for88 dollars plus tax canadianuh for the dimensions it is 180centimeters by 66 centimetersor 26 inches by 71 inches it is 5millimeters high or 0.19 inchesand it's a little bit over 5 poundsexactly 5.24pounds so it's a little heavy um to beused for a travel map buti'm using this for home workouts youknow since coved i've beendoing a lot of those andum this mat does come with the smell forsure i'll talk a little bit more aboutthat laterit does contain latexand the top layer which is this blackside hereit is smooth and it absorbs your sweatpretty well and allows you to grip tothe matalright so i have rolled out this matand it is pretty longas you can see at the bottom it has abeautifullululemon logo and rainbow print and atthe top there isthe logo here as wellum a couple of positives about this matis thatit absorbs your sweat really fast it'seasy to clean i just have to wipe itdownafter each youth with a damp towel orwashclothor paper towel um it's really grippy soif you're doing any type ofposes or push-ups or anything you'rejust going to stay put and your handsdon't slide around or anythingit's great quality i've had otherlululemon yoga mats for years and istill have themand they're still going strong andthat's one thing about lululemonespecially their yoga mats they'rereally great qualityall right so i'm gonna flip it over andshow you guys the back sideokay so here's slipped over on theorange side it's a really nice brightorange colorand you can see the logo here it's a bitof a darker orange colorjust going in a little closer you cansee this side is texturedand it's pretty sticky as well which isgreatand the thickness if you guys can seethatfive millimeters thick just flipped itback over sosome negatives about this mat are thatit really smells when you get iti know there's a lot of reviews thattalk about that but it smellsreally really strong when you first getit i kind of smells likecar tires mixed with like fish and it'sa really strong odorso i definitely would recommend airingit out before usei had to air mine out for about threedays and now it's good to goit smells a little bit when i put myface directly on it butthe smell has dissipated a lotalso um this type of matte the lululemonrats i don't know why but it collectslint and kind of dust and stuff likecrazyso you do have to make sure that you'recleaning it a lot because it doesattractthat type of materialsother than that i don't really have anynegatives i meanfor me i don't have any issues withdiscolorationor with staining from sweat or anythingum like i said i just cleaned it aftereach use and that's good for me my mouthdoesn't smell likeyou know body odor or anything else umyeah i would definitely recommend thismat you know give it a thumbs upand i have other lululemon yoga matsdifferent colors and i haven't had anyissues withdiscoloration or scratching or anythingas welli do try to you know baby them a littlebit and take good care of themmake sure after you wash them to letthem dry completelybefore rolling it back upand just try to clean it after each useso it's going to keep your mat lookingand good um so now i'm just going to doa little bit of a water sweat test soyou guys can see how fastsweat would absorb into the mat allright so i'm just going to put some onmy finger and show you guysso you can see that it is absorbingpretty fastand the black color doesn't really hidesweat i feel like some people thinkit does but what it does is umit just looks really nice and sleek andas you can see it's basicallyalmost completely absorbed there and thesame thing happens when i clean itjust wipe it off with a damp towel andthe waterabsorbs almost just as fastokay so that's all i have for todayabout this yoga mat i definitely wouldrecommend iti know 88 dollars is a lot but if you'regonnawant to buy something that you can keepfor years to come i definitely wouldrecommend the reversible mat bylululemon especially in this colorwayit's just beautifulon both sides andjust to tell you guys i don't use thisfor hot yoga or anythingso i don't sweat profusely on it i usethis mat for my home workouts anythingon the floorfor kind of basic yoga and stretchingif you take care of it you know it'sgoing to last you for years to comeand it just works well performance wiseand it looks greatif you guys have this match just let meknow what you think about it as welland if you'd like me to do reviews on myother lululemon yoga matsjust let me know in the comments belowthanks bye,19,UCq-rRFB--QKkWpe_13z1hgQ,Ghost Town Podcast,16,214,0,323,"['lululemon murders

a rich suburb a dark secret I'm JasonHorton I'm Rebecca liebe and this isghost town[Music][Music]police now say it was a pair of shoesthat first tipped them off the crimescene had two pairs of bloody footprintsbut police believe one of them was fakedby Brittany Norwood using a store pairto appear like a perpetrators footprintand when police found Norwood bound andgagged they now say the position she wastied up in was suspicious that with herhands tied above her head she may havetied herself up on the morning of March12th 2011 a Lululemon manager called 911after opening the Bethesda Marylandstore and finding two of her co-workersbloody and non-responsive so we'restarting with that right it's likeyou're just a mild-mannered manager of aLululemon going for your shiftyou find two of your co-workers likekind of you're you know employees justin different rooms blood everywhere andI wanna emphasize like blood was every Iwas looking for like pictures of thisand there aren't there are none onlinethere because everyone was like it wasit was horrific yoga pants' blood yogashoes hair ties towels I'm reallysurprised and maybe is in the works orif it exists I'm just ignorant of it butthere's some kind of a non scripted andshow based I'm looking like a dirty Johnor something like that it's got to be inthe works it must be because this isagain it's so fascinating for so manyreasons so she calls in she says there'stwo people in the back of my store oneperson seems dead and the other personis breathing she was telling thisfrenzied to a dispatcher on the morningof March 12th so the two women who areidentified were 29 year old BrittanyNorwood and 30 year old jayna Murray twoemployees who had closed up the storethe previous night Norwood was foundalive in the bathroom with superficialwounds her arms and legs were zip-tiedtogether Murray was discovered in smallhallway lying face down in a pool of herown blood she had suffered severe headtrauma 331 wounds beating choking stabwounds and was pronounced dead on thescene that makes it personal right whenthere's that like that 300 like what wasleft after 331 aren't you like likearen't you physically fatigued yeah likedoing that in general just swing yourarm 331 times absolutely it's probablymorecouple of misses in there I'm sure yeahI mean that is something that goes somuch deeper into wanting to killsomebody it's like insidious so let mejust tell a little bit about both ofthese people too that were found at thesceneso Brittany Norwood was anafrican-american woman she'd had pastcrimes before she had worked there for alittle while and then there was JanaMarie who was blond white she was agraduate student at Johns HopkinsUniversity like totally differentexperiences life experiences especiallyin this in Bethesda Maryland which wasvery very wealthy I kind of think aboutit like I grew up in kind of a wealthysuburb too just so sheltered and so Iremember like if there was anafrican-american person in our suburbthe cops would be like on it it wasreally I would imagine very difficult tobe a person that wasn't white in thiscontext so that's what we're workingwith right these two very differentemployees being found in two verydifferent situations at the Lululemon inBethesda Maryland so all of this moneywas missing from the source safe theattacks were what Britney said when shecame to consciousness was that these twoguys came in tried to rape them tried toassault them took all the money and leftand she said that they were just likeracist that they were rapists that theywere murderers robbers it was kind oflike this hyperbolic count it was likethey're everything yeah they're all thethings that they're that bad people yeahexactly it's like they were I don't knowlike their names were Hitler both ofthem you know okay well no but she gavethis account so everyone was going crazyand Bethesda everyone's like everyonewas being profiled everyone was lookingI can't imagine how nuts it must havebeen because also this place had neverhad anything like this such an intimateand violent murder maybe a possibleshoplifter mabel's yeah or like awhite-collar like tax like skimmingmoney you know off of some businessthing I know business all right exactlythe fact that the men would leaveNorwood alive with only a few injuriesafter inflicting so much on Murraydidn't make a lot of sense in additionthe men only use tools found in thestore during the attack which was a bigtip tip off of a for the copsthey hadn't brought any weapons of theirown norwood told police that she andmarie had returned to the store Fridaynight after he closed to retrievesomething norwood had forgotten this wasa lie we'll talk about it later whenthey did she said two men had followedthem into the store assaulted them bothand killed Murray again manhunt ensuedpolice looked into local data on skimask sales - because she said that shementioned that they had ski masks on soshe couldn't say what they look likethey offered a hundred and fiftythousand dollar reward for anyone whoknew anything about these men aroundtown who are going and breaking intoLululemon's they even tailed a man whofit the description of one of thekillers but then all this stuff kind oflike degraded right seven days later onFriday March 18th police arrestednorwood because her story just didn'tadd up the only bloody footprints policefound were Norwood's and those made bythe shoes that were found at the crimescene and those were a size 14 like yogashoe I didn't realize you did yoga inshoes but when I was in a Lululemon Iwas like oh this is 14 female yes okay14 Mills gigantic right I don't knowwhat is the average male shoe sizemine's 11 okay which is on the largerside okay so like a 10 or 9 yeah it'sprobably on the larger side exactly yeahso I was in the Lululemon I was like ohyeah they sell shoes it's more than justyoga in there not to say this is an adfor Lululemon it's most certainly is notyeah I left I was like whoa I wouldprobably don't physically jar by theprice don't need our publicity nothey're doing just fine despite thismurder do you want to mention theirpatreon - while you're at patreon.comslash Lulu's LeMans murdering bethesdapeople watchthat's very long yeah but I got it doyou got it yeah okay good mmmso Norwood was arrested her story didn'tadd up these bloody footprints werefound her own bruises after examinationcuz they took her to the doctor appearedself-inflicted and she'd been tied up insuch a way police said that she couldhave done it herself neither woman itturned out was sexually assaulted aswell so again her story is breaking downso then she was convicted of murderafterthis opening arguments in thefirst-degree murder trial of BrittanyNorwood charged in the killing of herco-worker jana marie she the otherpretty gruesome details were brought tolight holding the bloody rope foundaround the slain woman's neck and amerchandise display rod Wu used to bashher skullState Attorney John McCarthy said bloodtrails show that how the 30 year oldvictim tried unsuccessfully to escapeher attacker through a back doorso essentially she had this rope and shehad a merchandise display rod that shewas beating her and torturing her withas she tried to escape also this isLululemon from what I know from my onetime in the lemon in Malibulike it is it's a place for fit womenit's a culture of fitness and wellnessand kind of like bullshitty New Agestuff would you give it would you say itthere's any semblance of like acult-like atmosphere of being like youknow if you were you lemons you know youyou know you wear other things and thenyou're not yes and this is somethingthat also was brought to light kind ofduring the trial and all of that reallyall the things like this is why I likethe case so much like you know classrace culture all of that kind of wasbrought to a head in this specificmurder case so they talked very veryspecifically about how jayna was tryingto get through the back door of thelittle lemon she was bleeding Brittanywas attacking herthey were also 107 defense wounds causewhen Murray tried to fend off her attackwhen the medical examiner examined herand she said it's the most that she hadever seen in one woman so this was likea fight like a straight-up like thiswoman was fighting for her lifeMurray was trying like she was trying tosurvive and then Norwood did not wantthat to happen and it's like what causedit was so violent again in a culturethat felt the least violent you knowthink about how long this took Gina isalive through almost all of this mr.McCarthy who was a state attorney saiddescribing how 8 separate items found inthe upscale yoga inspired apparel storewas used as well as weapons sorrythe last wounds are from knives this wasnot slow this was notpainless this woman struggle to survivelet's take a little break there and thenwe'll get back to the results you knowwhat I'm thinking is like the fact thatusing the items from Lululemon they'reprobably somewhat specific to Lululemonin a sense yeah their own thing makesthe whole thing more I don't I don'tknow what it makes it it just makes itlike it's just personal and yeah so Ithink when you're like we all thinkabout murderers we think about weaponswith murder we think about a gun a knifea rope you know we think about peoplebreaking in we think about just we takemurder and a lot of the things aroundmurder and put it in its own littlecategory but I think when you're usingthings that people use Kamui differentlyto murder people or in a totallydifferent culture you're like that isvery disturbing you're using your ownspecific culture kind of a guess isbeing used against you I guess but thething you use to dress a mannequin Idon't know but yeah it was used againstyou which is it has to make it even moreit just makes the whole thing moresinister and I makes him moreinteresting absolutely and also for ourpodcast specifically exploring thesethings through place thinking about alittle lemon and experiencing it for thefirst time and being like oh this islike [ __ ] upscale retail store thisis not the site of a murder no it's notlike a you know for like oh thishappened at a 7-elevenyou know in Camden New Jersey you'd belike oh yeah get it totally gay I meanunless somebody was like they you knowthe Snickers bar yeah I mean it's in the7-eleven with the Snickers bar so thatmakes it yeah like you said that makesthe place very atypical and superviolent yeah really is it really isreally contrary yeah and I think aboutthe malls that I grew up with and likeif this had happened again in theupscale mall like talk about Chicago oneof our fans is from there there's asmall called Old Orchard which is thisferry we would go there to get our aboutMitzvah and Bar Mitzvah [ __ ] because itwas much nicer than the Wisconsin mallsbut just having this place where you'relike oh this is safe this is safebecause we think it's all a perceptionto only oh now people that are alreadywell off or they don't know they don'thave want for anything so they'reexactly they're not gonna risk anythingexactly so the perception of what thistown and this mall was is also reallyfascinating okay so while attorneys fromMiss Norwood hinted in the months beforethe trial that they might pursue aninsanity defense attorney Douglas woodacknowledged his in his openingstatement that his client had attackedMurray but that she had not planned tokill her so that's where they were goingwith they were like not premeditatedjayna was killed by Brittany but notwith premeditation mr. wood said duringthat fight Brittany Norwood lost itthere is no doubt about that she lostcontrol yeah no [ __ ]331 wounds the defense argued for aconviction of second-degree murderclaiming the attack was not premeditatedthe case received intense media coverageand was commonly referred to as theLululemon murder in January 2012 Norwoodwas sentenced to life imprisonment withno possibility of parole in a publishedopinion on April 29 2015 the court ofSpecial Appeals of Maryland rebuffedNorwood's request for a new trialeffectively ending her direct appealoptions so after this it all happenedright and everyone's like holy [ __ ] andalso there was this weird sense ofrelief in the town to where it wasn'tjust some strange man it's got so manythings it was relief but it was alsolike oh one of us did this but was sheone of us really because again it's likepredominantly white very upper classesis not the background that BrittanyNorwood came from but again they werelike we isolated who this is they'rebeing sentenced they will not be at sothen Brittany Norwood kind of like cameclean on all this stuff so basicallywhat she said she spoke publicly for thefirst time since the killing addressedMarie's family before learning herpunishment before I go to prison shesaid I needed to hear how deeply sorry Iam so in the after-hours confrontationapparently sparked by Norwoods attemptto steal a pair of yoga pantsauthorities said she bludgeoned shechoked and stabbed Murray using at leastfive weapons to inflict again more thanall of these 300 some separate wounds totry and conceal her crime Norwoodtracked size-14 sneakers throughMurray's blood to make it appear as if alarge person had been there she thentied herself up gave herself a few minorwounds bound her own handsankles in a restroom in itial ii fooldetectives with an elaborate tale abouta pair of mass murderers so until thecover-up unraveled police considered novictim and she was treated as a Becca noshe was treated as kind of like a heroalmost which again must have been such ait was such a turn until it's like herode a murderer and people were veryafraid but she came clean abouteverything that happenedso she was alive laying in the bathroomwhile her co-worker bled out andeventually died in another room which isso crazy so you can imagine and it'salso some theorizing about theirrelationship to as coworkers and againthis is where the cultural thing comesin this is where difference in race andbackground come in the idea of like okaythey're there that night after the shiftNorwood had stolen yoga pants Murrayconfronted her a white woman ofprivilege can vote confronting a blackwoman who did not have the sameprivilege especially in the context ofLululemon where it's like you know hiread somewhere that they had such astrict culture it's like no so if youdrank soda yeah that's gonna bring uplike what is what what hoops needed tobe jumped through I think like I think Irecall that you don't just work thereyeah you live it you you have to be a ofa certain disease I think people makefun of or Senna parodies of us is likeyou know like The Devil Wears Prada yeahthing like that oh absolutely I feellike this is you can't just be oh soyou're you know a thin attractive youknow about yoga pants not a no yeah yeahyou don't have a criminal record no noyou know you have to you know be youhave to kind of live the lifestyleaccording to Lululemon exactly and andthat means a lot of different things alot of well yes exactly but both thesewomen were like again very attractivevery intelligent women so it's like Iget how they were both hired but againit just goes to show the facade and alsojust the facade of like being in thereand all those mantras like they have abunch of like mantras and they havethose bags which they talk about a lotand they have like all of this like it'slike if you when I was in there I waslike oh what if I wanted to just buy onething and it wasn't like a set of thingthere they are kind of like shoving thisdown your throatlifestyle because yeah buying one pantsit like isn't enough there it's like ohyou want the set of like the pants andthe headband and like there's so manylike things like American of power waslike a little bit like every night yeahmaybe there was a certain like kind ofat least marketing culture around it inthe people that were I mean I've been tomm-hmm a lot of American Apparel ISMyeah sure we like their t-shirts yeahnow so Wow well is this an ad forAmerican Apparel I don't think theyaround an image i n't abandonedwarehouse in LA but so yeah so I thinkMaria Norwood they work together rightMarie realized the nerd had stolen somepants you know would got defensive likewho knows exactly what happened butsomething ensued were it escalated to apoint of death really and then she hadto cover it up and then she was kind ofvictimized in a way that made her bealmost hero like and then that allunraveled I think you get you get to apoint where you're you know you're likeI'm just gonna steal some yoga pantsyeah after hours so like it's not yachances of getting caught which would beI'm close with somebody that works inthat field we're dealing with internaltheft shoplifting on a big scale yeahI've also you know once upon a time whenI was a child I used to shoplift a lotoh I did do yes I got you know I mean Igot a little in out of trouble for thatgave up my evil ways but I look at younow what what yeah I should I should goback to it yeah the what people will dowhen they're caught yes is they wouldyou know I don't think it's like fiveblu-rays or a bunch of diapers orwhatever what people will do to toescape prosecution is a lot yeahdefinitely it's especially wanting tokeep this job in this job it has a highlevel of acceptance I actually was doingsome research on how much they get paidat lemon ah I don't know specificallywhich I also in my mind it was like theyget paid like [ __ ] and like this is butI don't know I'm not sure so we're notsure how much you needed the job I alsodid some research on Norwood and there'sa lot of theorizing around her being asex worker her doing a lot of things tomake ends meet so you think about thelevel of desperation when getting caughtand needing a job and what you would doto make sure that went away I'm gonnayou know if the thing was like I justwant tosome passes like it keeps like now I'vegone so far I got yeah the bands are atleast by the way it's $78 at leastthat's the low end of their yoga pantsand I want a pair that's like very badlyain't yeahthat's like they're on sale like youcan't get the right size yeah exactly sothey are very expensive I think they goup to 250 dollars for a pair of yogapants that's we're talking big bucks Imean it's the yoga should do itselfexactly it'd just be an automated yogapant you can get out of it and theyfinish the yoga for you yeah and thenyou just sleep and yeah and just begoing Moscow mules I don't know why thatcame up my mind I don't know you'rethirsty thirsty anyway so this is areally fascinating thing she's still injail there's a foundation for Murray andher family and they've spoken out a lotof about this but it's really it's it'sreally sad and very fascinating and alsogoes to show that like you think someplace is safe or a nice quote unquote ormoneyed or whateverit ain't no it ain't hard lesson learnedwhat made you go in there there Rose inMalibu it's just living my life I knowit was in a shopping mall there and Iwent to like get some like coffee orsomething and it was right it was like aSephora lemon it was one of those likereally expensive Greek yogurt places andI was like I should pop in yeah seemaybe I'll buy something how was thehouse the like the the employees how wasthe culture aggressive yeah like youwould think I mean I guess notaggressive to me now like knowingespecially like you know when you signup for something or like when you'regetting aggressively emailed or textedabout things it was just it was veryretail II it's very like can we help youfive minutes later can we help you doany help what do you do like and they'reeverywhere there's actually what Ireally was surprised at as how manyemployees are there there there werelike six employees there and it's not avery big store it's kind of small butthey were all watching they were all ontop of it well I guess for now you haveto stick with Old Navy right yeah Igotta get those old navy pants nobody'skilling for that[Music][Music],17,UCCzODDnIM4xdZxOLUGF7KSg,lululemon,7,9,0,105,"['lululemon', 'yoga', 'run', 'sweat', 'seawheeze', 'post-run', 'post run', 'stretch']",Post-Race Yoga with Ryan Leier |

what's up guys my name is Brock you'rewatching the modest man today we'retalking about the five best underwearbrands for men okay so we wear underwearmore than any other article clothing andit also covers a very important part ofour bodies so I think it's crucial thatyou have underwear that you really loveand it's super comfortable I think thata lot of guys don't realize howcomfortable underwear can be you know Iused to be in that group I used to buywhatever baggy cotton boxers I couldfind on sale on a multi pack at a Parkinstore but once I discovered it the worldof super comfortable underwear you knowthere's no going back but first of allwhat makes a great pair of underwear Ithink it comes down to two main thingsnumber one it has to be really reallycomfortable it has to be soft no chafingit doesn't ride up and number two it'sgot to be durable you know especially ifI'm paying good money for a pair ofunderwear I don't want it to fall apartor stretch out or start to deteriorateafter a few wash cycles now I've triedmany many different underwear brands alot of the most popular brands somelesser-known manufacturers and I'venarrowed it down to my top five picksthese are five specific pairs ofunderwear from five different brandswith one honorable mention quick notethis is not a sponsored video but I willlink to all this underwear down in thedescription and if I have any promocodes I'll include those down there aswell ok number one the Lululemon noboxer boxers now I know what you'rethinking isn't a Lululemon that playsfor my girlfriend goes to get overpricedyoga pants yes it is but I think theyrealized somewhere along the way thatthere are a bunch of guys waiting fortheir girlfriends to finish up shoppingand maybe they would like to buysomething too so Lululemon actuallycreated one of the most comfortable anddurable pairs of underwear that I'veever worn and actually I have to give mydad credit for finding these I thought Ihad the underwear game figured out andone year he he got me a pair of thesefor Christmas and he said you know youhave to try these the most comfortableunderwear I've ever worn so I thought okI'll give him a shot and I got to say hewas right these are one of my favoritepairs they're made from lycra so it's avery dry very soft fabric but it's notlike micro Modell where it has a ton ofstretch has a little bit of four-waystretch but not a whole lot really goodat wicking moistur you could definitelyworeout we go for a hike in these my onlycomplaint about these is that you knowthey're not the best looking underwearin the world they're not ugly they'rejust compared to some of the other picson my list they're just not remarkableyou know but I don't know it's it's awell rounded pair of underwear so ifyou're looking for something that's justyou know durable good for pretty muchany occasion definitely recommendLululemon no box or boxers okay numbertwo we have the tinny silk cut boxerbriefsso if Lululemon is the laid-back girlnext door at Annie is that lady at workthat kind of looks like a supermodelthat you're pretty sure is out of yourleague but might have been flirting withyou the other day these are justluxurious okay they're they're knit inEurope they're made from micro Modellwhich is a softer and thinner than silkthey also have 6% elast stain woven inso plenty of four-way stretch andthey're just super super comfy well whatreally sets tani apart is how they lookthe only word I can really think of todescribe these is sexy and especiallythese printed ones they also have solidcolors but I think these prints arereally nice they also make a trunkversion of this which is a slightlyshorter but I prefer the box for briefbecause I think it doesn't ride up asmuch what surprised me about these isthey're so soft and they're so thin thatI kind of thought they wouldn't hold upwell but I've been wearing these for acouple of years pretty regularly andthey retain their shape but they haven'tstretched out they've even retain theircolor so you know they're surprisinglydurable for how luxurious they feel soif looks are a priority I highlyrecommend the tannestill cut boxer briefs okay next upnumber three we have me undies boxerbriefsso speaking of good looks beyond theseare also very good looking like thetanne boxer briefs they're made from ablend of micro Modell and elastane sovery stretchy I'd say even more stretchythan than Tanny very comfortable verygood-looking I have noticed that theyrun a little bit small compared to otherbrands so keep that in mind if you'rebetween sizes you might want to size upnow listen these aren't as lugsas the Tani's but they're also abouthalf the price so definitely a lot ofbang for your buck with me on these theother thing that I like about these isthey're available in a bunch ofdifferent colors from classic solidcolors to more saturated bold colorslike this to crazy patterns like youknow tiger stripes and just forreference my actual waist measurement isabout 29 inches usually we're at 28pants to accommodate for vanity sizingand these are size small they fit but Iwould not want them any tighter so therethey are noticeably a little smallerthan the other brands but they haveplenty of stretch so like I said ifyou're in between sizes maybe size upokaynumber four we have ex-officio andspecifically the give-and-go boxerbriefs now as you can see these havesome wear and tear I've had these foryears actually first got these when Iwas going on a pretty intense hikingtrip in Zion and Bryce national park Igot these from REI after hearing aboutthem from Tim Ferriss he swore by theex-officio brand so I gave these a shotand he was right these are my go-tounderwear for travel by far so I usuallywhenever I travel I bring two pairs ofthese and they served me really wellbecause they're very dry they wickmoisture they don't hold odor andthey're very easy to clean they dry sofast you can hand wash them in the sinkand they're dry in like less than anhour's you can put them back on theseare nylon spandex blend so kind of likethe Lululemon underwear they have alittle bit of four-way stretch but notas much as like Tanny or me undies andalso like the Lululemon underwear theseare not sexy you know they're not thebest looking underwear in the world butthey're workhorses so I think if you'rea traveler if you'd like to pack lightI'd highly recommend ex-officio given gobox or briefs you know if you're goingon a big date maybe leave these at homeand choose something else like me onthese are tanning okay and number fivewe have kind of a newcomer actuallyribbedteeg2 cool nylon boxer briefs now I've beenwearing ribbed tee under searched foryears now Ino the founder Mike Schwartz I waspretty excited when they announced thatthey were launching it underwear line Iactually helped Mike dial in themeasurements for the small size so theysent some samples over and I gotta saythe final product is amazing and theseare different I mean you can probablytell like they even look different thansome of the other offerings on the listthey don't have that big elasticwaistband they have this kind of hiddenblind hem waistband it's very minimaland it's super comfortable there's nopinching it doesn't have like a sharpedge so it doesn't dig into your skin atall there are no tags so nothing to youknow cause any itching on your lowerback one thing I've noticed there are alittle bit lower rise than some of theother brands on my list so you know justkeep that in mind in terms of looks Iwould say that these are better thanLululemon or ex-officio but they're notas handsome as me undies or Tanny but Ithink they're super super comfortableand just really well-made so definitelycheck them out okay and then thehonorable mention is this pair from Saksand I wanted to include these becausethere's this whole category of men'sunderwear that has basically extrasupport built in to the inside so asSaks which is kind of this minimallining that sort of creates a pouch foryour boys now some underwear makers havebuilt their entire brand around thisextra support for example there's abrand called sheath that has some prettycrazy pouch work going on they have thisone main pouch for your boys pluralanother smaller pouch for your boysingular and then even a little fly inthe front so you can get in and outeasily now personally I'm okay with thetraditional pouch list underwear youknow I don't really need that extrasupport but some guys swear by it so youknow if it's something you might likedefinitely try it out I do keep this onepair of sacks in my rotation justbecause I think they're prettygood-looking and they are prettycomfortableI like the minimal pouch but becausethey're so thin I've noticed thatthey're not quite as durable as otherunderwear and they're very soft so theytend to ride up a little moreand there's definitely a risk of wedgiegoing on with these so these wouldn't bemy first choice if I was gonna do likeyard work all day I might reach forthese if I was going on a date the otherthing I do like is they they have extrasmall sizes so if you are a very smallguy you might want to check out sacksokay so those are my top five pairs ofunderwear I hope that helps you decidewhich pair of underwear to buy and ifyou have any opinions if you've triedsome underwear that wasn't on this listthat you really love definitely let meknow down in the comments so I can trythem out and until next time staystylish[Music][Music]you,22,UCY3_f-t8VBYh9rq8iHS-kdg,AbbyBReviewing,4,0,0,9,No

giveaway soif you're interested in entering makesure to go to the video on the top rightwhen you're done watching thisso i know a lot of you guys just want toknow one thing are the align pants worthityou know because they're expensive youmight be just used to buying like 3020 leggings and you're thinking heyshould i spend 88 98on a legging i don't know i'm gonna tellyou right nowyes they

don'tknow what size to get i would highlyrecommend that you look on their sizingchartso my size recommendation for the alignpants is stay true tosize guys i know some people do like tosize down in their line pants butfrom my experience when i've done thatin the past i find that the align pantswhen i size down they stretch out overtime and then you're kind of just leftwith leggings thatare too loose and they fall off of youbecause you're like stretching thefabric over its limits so i would highlyrecommend staying true to size becausethese are expensive like you don't wantthem to stretch out on youi definitely don't anyways all rightguys so now i'm going to go ahead andtry all of these on for you so you cansee what they look like on me so this iswhat they look likeon me so these are the 21 inchaligned high rise crop they'redefinitely someone who likes like funcolors and prints sowhen they do go on sale that is awesomefor me i will be definitely grabbingthem upand this is where they do kind of landon me so as you can see they'redefinitely a croppedlength on me and once again i am 5'8but these are 21 inches but honestly ifind that there's like extra stretch orsomething becausei think they fit pretty long on me allright guys so here we have the 23 inchlines this is how long they go on mebut i actually like these ones becausethey fit it's like a nice crop on me andthen they're typically like 10less than the full length so yeahif you're looking for like a croppedlook you might want to go with one oftheseso here we have the align pant 28 inchand as you can see they come all the waydown on methis is my favorite length and style ofalign pants to purchasethey're definitely full length on meand i find them super comfortable andflatteringand it does go up pretty high all rightso i hope you guys found it helpfulseeing me try these onand now i just want to talk about thefabrics so the align pad fabricon all of these is lululemon's nulufabric and it's buttery softit's comfortable it's sweat wickingand it just has like a nice feel on yourskin like honestlyyou just don't want to stop touchingbecause it's so soft and just lettingyou guys knoweach of these does have a little pocketin the waistband right hereand it's not huge it is right here itcan be used to hold maybe like somechapsticks a credit card some changestuff like thatit's definitely nice to have other thanthat there are no pockets on it i lovethe align pant because of theminimalistic looks there's no kind ofextra seaming anywherenothing on the sides you just kind ofhave like across herethat's it and i love on the back theyhave this like vright here which i find very flatteringall right guys so now i just want totalk about pricing becausefirst off i want to let you know thatthe diamond dial lines typically areabout ten dollars more than the solidcolorswhether or not you want to spend theextra ten dollars to get like thediamond knife pattern is up to youbut for me i definitely think it's worthit i think that these ones are superflattering and i love the diamond eyepowder just becauseyou know they hide like anyimperfections or if you guys prefer youcan definitely go for like a solid colorand save the extra ten dollarsor basically every thursday whenlululemon does like their typical saledays onlineyou will see a line pants come out indifferent colors in different lengthson the we made too much section so iactually bought these two on we made toomuchall right guys so you may have noticedthat i did not show you guys the 25 inchalign panfor me because i am 5 8 the 25 inch justsits really awkwardly on meso i actually don't have any of mycollection when i did try them on i justdidn't like them so i didn't end uppurchasing them but i love the 28 inchit fits me full lengthso depending on your height differentlengths might work better for youso i have the tag for the alignhigh-rise crop23 inch in case you guys do want to seeany of that informationnow i don't just

from the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las VegasNevadait's the cube covering coupe inspire2019brought to you by Koopa welcome to thecube at Koopa inspired 19I'm Lisa Martin on the ground at theCosmopolitan in Las Vegas and we'repleased to welcome to the cube Michaelvan keulen global procurement directorof lululemon athletica Michael welcometo the cube thank you I'm a big Louloufan have been for many many years ifanybody doesn't know Lululemon this is athree plus billion dollar designerdistributor and retailer of a reallycool technical athletic apparel you'vebeen there for a few years now came froma finance background one of the thingsthat I love about Lululemon is theinspirational messages on the bags youknow I anytime I'm in a grocery storeand you have to bring your own bags iI'm I'm nearsighted I can spot aLululemon bag from a mile awaytalk to us about just one of theexamples of this procurementtransformation that you've helpedinitiate when you came in and foundsomething really interesting about thisiconic brand this iconic bag sure yeahso when I joined the company we you knowyou start to do to your basic spendcuban alysus and trying to figure outlike where the big spent items are andgiven that the bag is so visible foreverybody I figured like that's reallylike a big volume lots of spend veryvisible and very important to ourbusiness so I started to dig into ourshopping bag as a as a category and Iuncovered that it was a single sourcewith one Factory in Cambodia with anine-month lead time but nobody in thecompany really knew that so when I wasput in front of our senior executive totalk about like you know what where do Ifeel there's opportunity there was somepushback on me digging into a shopperand that there was even perspective inin in in the senior executive teams thatI didn't really understand how importantour shopper is and then when I asked thequestion where does the shopper comefrom where is it made how is it madewhat's the lead time what's the costthere were lots of unknowns and when Ithrew that on the table and said wellit's single sourced one factory inCambodia you can immediately see a lotof people don't like what it's veryinteresting and they started to realizethat procurement is not just aboutsaving money which we also did but it'salso about de-risking our supply chainbeing more nimble and more agile yesit's gonna say that that what youdiscovered was a massive risk to thebrand I think the bag is what is what isthe number one brand asset totally it'svery visible so but that was really thetip of the iceberg of some of the thingsyou came in saying you know asprocurement there is a massive massivemany massive impact elements that it canhave on the business right so going fromsort of a tactical to a strategicapproach how was the bag as an exampleable to start helping you transform theculture of loulou to be more strategicand start looking at all of the otherways in which this business can derivevalue from a number of the otherelements besides the bag yeah and so westarted to identify like what are someof our core principles when it comes tohow we source and how we procure therethose are things to me like fact-baseddecision making analytics knowing whatyou buy how you buy where you buycompetitive pressure making sure thesuppliers realized that we have optionsin the marketplace I mean those are someof the key like key components ofrunning a competitive competitivedepartment that drives a competitiveadvantage and that's really what wefocus on it at little lemon inprocurement some of the disruptors thatwe see in procurement finance today areconsumerization Rob Bernstein talkedabout it this morning with some of thethings that Cooper is now doing with theAmazon Marketplace but as consumerswhether we're consuming Lulu Lulu Lemonproducts or software we have choice wealso have this expectation that we cango somewhere and find it anybody that'sselling this particular product I cansee the prices I can see you know thepricing pressures put on I can see allthe different suppliers so theconsumerization sort of disruptor isreally interesting to every industry howare you leveraging that toto really drive much more value not justsaving cost but even things likeimpacting shareholder value really yeahyou know I think table stakes today isjust managing spent right knowing whereyour money goes and trying to make surethat we stretch the dollars as much aswe can I think is what every procurementfunction does I think what distinguishesthe world class from from the let's saythe middle of the pack is are you ableto contribute to top-line growth how areyou able to innovate are you able toinnovate through your suppliers and soone example this is how we implementedthird-party gift cards at our at manygrocers across North America that'sthere was an idea generating from fromprocurement tying into gift cards thatwe already source and that we now havethird-party gift cards at the Kroger'sand the likes that just drive moretraffic to our stores and it's just itwas really exciting cool idea that youknow wouldn't necessarily come from aprocurement you know traditionalprocurement function but one that reallywants to contribute to your futuregrowth one that wants to contribute tofuture growth and that has a strategicvision when we look at the Koopacommunity there's now 1.2 trilliondollars of transactions going throughthat there's a tremendous amount of dataand we go to so many conferences at thecube every year and we hear verycommonly data is the new oil total datais gold it is those things if you havethe right if you have visibility and theopportunity to extract value from it andact on it immediately talk to me alittle bit more about the thethird-party giftcard approach and wasthat something that the you said we haveso much more visibility into our datainto our consumers into our suppliersthere's an obvious low-hanging fruitopportunity here how do the data helpyou make that decision no this was morean idea where you start to look at likewhat value can procurement drive otherthan just managing and reducing cost andyou know every other big apparelretailer is already in this third partyspace and Lululemon is not and and youknow the power of our companies we arevertically integrated you can only buyour product at Lululemon and some selectstrategic partners but opening up thedoors to for people to be experiencingour brand in a different way throughpurchasing a gift card or being gifted agift card I should say and that thataudience that now comes into our storeit just could potentially be acompletely new guest and that is what iswhat is super exciting so let's talkabout some of the business impact ofthat so I would like to be on thereceiving end of the lulu gift card foranybody who's watching my birthday's inmarch and but in terms of like what aresome of the things that you've seen mapback to top-line impact from thatincrease in new customers acquiredincrease in customer lifetime value whatare some of those big impacts thatprocurement has made with what seemslike an aha this is a simple idea weshould be doing this too you know Ithink what little lemon does better thanany retailer on the planet is oureducators right our educators in ourstores and so it's my job is how do Iset these guys up for success so I thinkone way we're now doing and leveragingthe Cooper platform is taken awayadministrative complexity so the lesserthe administer administrative burden ison our stores and our educators thebetter they are with engaging with ourguests and educating them on our productwhy we make it what it does so that ourour consumers that we call guestsultimately not just make the transactionbut also buy the right product they knowwhat the product is supposed to do forthem and how it's supposed to fit andhow it's supposed to to help them intheir daily lives and so whatprocurement really does is just takeaway that complexity that they havetoday so that they can focus on whatthey do bestso walk me through who within so one ofthe things that Kupa does is more than Ithink any other competitors is itsprocurement its invoices expensespayments tell me about all the differentways in which Lululemon is leveragingKupa and walk me through kind of anaverage user experience this is somebodylike an individual contributor inmarketing or finance give me a littlebit of a taste of that yeah so we useCooper for sourcing contractingrequisitioning purchase orders and thenflip that Bo in to pay so we use thefull suite okayof solution the biggest focus presses onthe downstream as we call procure-to-payso it's a lot of people placingrequisitions and that can be inmarketing it could be in the store itcould be in any part of our businessreally and the downstream is the mostimportant element because that's wherethe visibility comes and then from aprocurement standpoint we use thesourcing and the CLM platform but thedownstream is read where the merge wherethe magic happens so is every businessunit within Lululemon on the Koopaplatform so we we launched North Americaon February 4thwe're live in 18 stores as a pilot andwe're gonna roll out all of NorthAmerican the entire fleet in Augustso just February of 2019 so just whatfive months or so ago and the impact tothe business that you've seen with justthese first 18 stores yeah it's not justthe 18 stores its inclusive of our headoff head office and our distributioncenters in North Americamaybe we just now focus on supplierenablement more suppliers on theplatform more spent through the portaland we the store sits it's a it's apilot it's going really well and and ifthe stores are gonna get it I'm prettysure they would be very pleased so wetalked about the kind of the consumerthe guest experience supplier centricitywhat have you achieved with respect tosupplier centricity using Kupa and howis that affecting everybody up to thec-suite and your organization in termsof well procurement is really a businessengine here we do invest in yeah I thinkour if you look at our journey when westarted three years ago where weliterally had no real procurement as itis described today we're still in thatin a journey of of maximizing oursupplier relationships and through oursupplier relationships really driveinnovation I think we're not entirelythere yet I think that is one of thenext iterations is is how do we takeprocurement to the next level and if youlook back the last few years whatsurprises you about coming from afinance background now being in chargeof procurement for a major global brandwhere are what are some of the thingsthat surprised you about this future ofprocurement andwe're Lululemon is set up to besuccessful I think the biggest surprisesis that people never intentionally dobusiness with a company that we we mayor may not be we should be doingbusiness with right now people neverintentionally do that it's just becausethey don't ask the right questionsaround ownership structure and risk andsustainability and reputational risk andenvironmental risk and and just costaside and and what I think whatprocurement helps to do is to actuallyask all those questions so that we endup with the right company with the rightpricing the right quality the rightspecs the right the right everything Ithink that's what surprised me is isthat that that missing link thatprocurement brings to the table so ifyou if you had to you know give yourpeers in any industry some advice wouldit be first of all help establish aculture that is willing to ask questionsbecause there's that whole thing tooright we always think well maybe it's adumb question have that culture that isno question as a dumb question ask askask yeah yeah and lulu's fortunately notfor such a young company so I had a lotof great stakeholders I still have themtoday that are highly supportive it'snever just me or my team it iscollaboration it's it's cross-functionaleverybody has to have something in itright so so you lose a very youngcompany so if you're a very you knowmaybe more mature organization wherepeople are set in their ways it justbecomes a little so I used to work forVF Corp which is it slightly morematured been around for a hundred yearsthere it required more convincing theremay be a little lemon where you knowagain like people were just are just thepopulation is much younger and and wewere just you know we needed morestructure and people recognize that theappetite was the appetite was there forsure last question for you Michael someof the things that are being announcedthis week at inspire we heard thismorning about we mentioned a minute agoabout the size of the the Koopacommunity the amount of data the valuethat it's driving for customers and forsuppliers also they talked about thisamazon marketplace that they're thatthey're expanding this relationship sothat IT folks can have this full suiteof visibility what excites you mostabout the direction that Koopa is goingin yeah I mean it's it's the data it'sthe native integrations with amazthe lights absolutely what excites methe most in terms of the differentmodules is Cooper pay you know I've I'veI've been wanting to go after that youknow dynamic discounting that's whatCooper Bay is gonna kind of enable us todo the virtual pay is not a bigopportunity where we can start flowing alot of our payments through a virtualpayment system our payment cards thatexcites mebut it's the data and it's how do we asa community start to leverage your spendI think will be will be absolutelyawesome yeah that yes and thatcollaborative spirit this morning wasreally palpable well Michael it's been apleasure to have you on the cube todaycongratulations on what you've done itat Lulu and for Lulu being a coupletsuspend better thank you for Michael vankeulenI'm Lisa

day longyou're so softthere's some gravely soft but I justcan't stop doing this however I don'tthink they're very cutemaybe it's just because they're so highwaisted why are my pants way up herethere's no more pants go ideally that'sthe highest my leggings go there if Ipay 98 dollars for a pair of leggings Ishouldn't have to roll the waist downdownI shouldn't have to roll the waist downhim down like

this is the Lululemon ABC pant ABCstands for anti ball crush and becausethere's a gusset in them but I'm gonnalet me first start by saying that Idon't even know that Lululemon made anyclothes for man at all let alone pants Iprobably wouldn't walked into aLululemon store we made some contactsover at the O our show and had thesesent to us and like I said while Iprobably wouldn't have ended up pickingthat up picking these up they claim thatyou will want to live in these pantsand that and if that is true for meokay.we they're probably one of the mostcomfortable pants I've ever worn and letme just run you through some of thefeatures that I think make them that wayso one is the gusset that they have inthe crotch area so you don't have anyany kind of bunching at all so if you'redriving in the car or if you're bikingor anything like that they're supersuper comfortable they have a little bitof stretch to them as well actuallyquite a bit of stretch to them thatmakes it very comfortable they're madeout of an out of a wicking fabric and sowe actually went pretty long walk todayand it was pretty warm out and it washot and super comfortable that'sabsolutely true about them they do havesix pockets which is pretty cool too twoin the front one small one in the backand then on the back side you haveobviously the two regular pockets butthen one of them also includes a secondzipper pocket inside if I'm going to beout and about for a whole daybeing pretty active and I have cash onme I love to have it in a zipper pocketso I like that feature a lot as well acouple of things I like about these onethat I was pretty surprised to find outwas that anytime you buy a pair of pantsfrom Lululemon you can get them tailoredfor free so that was pretty awesome Ihave a pretty short inseam pretty shortguy so I had to get a couple of justtaken off the bottom they took care ofthat for me no problemanother feature I like is that when youroll up the pant leg here on the bottomcheck that there is a reflector on theinside so if you bike a lot you're goingto roll them up I think this is justbrilliant designif you bike a lot you roll up your pantsanyway so they don't get caught in thechain and why not put some kind ofreflector on the inside of the pants soI think that's just fantastic so that isthe Lululemon ABC pant the other thingthat to know about these that I alsofound out when I went in to get themtailored and I wasn't sure if honor toexchange them or not is that they're allpre washed and they were very adamantabout it not shrinking even a quarter ofan inch so which I was a little bitskeptical of because I fit perfectlywhen I first got them and that ended upbeing true of watch them a couple timesand they're exactly the same they tailorthem for free they're about 128 bucksand while that's might seem a little biton the steep side for a pair of pantsI'm telling you man for as comfortableas they are and time will tell how longthey last but if I get a couple yearsout of these worth it they really areone of the most comfort purse pants everhad that's the Lululemon ABC pen,26,UC-Xuiw6y4FGg6eZUJps0ZZA,Arccway,26,7,0,50,"['Mininlistic menswear', 'minimalist Modern', 'style for men with capsule wardrobe', 'minimalist menswear', 'style tips modern mens style', 'style for guys', 'style talk', 'menswear review', 'men with style', 'types of fashion styles', 'minimalist style', 'minimalist clothing', 'capsule collection', 'fashion wear', 'fashion today', 'cheap designer clothes', 'lululemon mens joggers', 'lululemon men', 'mens high waisted pants', 'men in yoga pants', 'types of pants for men', 'mens jogger pants', 'men of style']",LULULEMON - LICENSE TO TRAIN PANTS 30&quot; REVIEW | MENSWEAR,VkOCTCRYVMY,6785
so when it comes into track pants andouterwear I recently went down to Lulaminute picked up a new pair of pantsthey are the men's license to trainingpants they're very lightweight andactually something that will get the jobdone when it comes to warming up when itcomes to training when it comes tocomfort ability I'm finding product Itruly trust at the same time I believeyou guys will love it as much as I dowhat's going on guys welcome back to ouraway new direction of the modern man myname is mister Liu and today I haveanother review just for you guys soreally I bought these pair of pants wasbecause I was looking for something Ican actually step away from the sweatpants look because sometimes you wearsweat pants and it doesn't feel as ifyou're training or just feels like it'sa lazy day or whatever the case is butfor me I personally wanted to step awayfrom the sweat pants and I'm going tohave something more of a fitness lookbut at the same time I wanted to havethat Fitness incorporation where I cantrain in it but also go to the gym andit doesn't feel like it looks like it'scoming off of his lazy vibe or anythingelse as opposed to having sweatpants ifthey're not just outright it could bringthat impression so like I said before Ibought these pants on Lululemon I doadvise for you guys to check it outfirstbefore you make your purchase evenonline because I actually got a sizethat what Ruby it didn't fit to myliking and based on how the style is youcan actually be thought other wrong so Iwant to review these pair of pants foryou guys it is the license to train byLululemon pants these are size mediumfor me I stand about 6 foot 182 poundsslim athletic build and I truly thoughtI would fit like a large or maybe an XLbut for me a medium was actually perfectfit for me so lengthwise these pantswere about a 30-inch on these pants andthe cool thing about these pants whichI'll get into more feature is it doeshave a look a little tailoring system atthe bottom of it so that was pretty coolit needs give them various sizes for meI got them in the 30 inch my waist willbe around the 32 so for me it kind ofworked out to be in the medium sectionso they do have different variationswhen it comes down to length and also itcomes down to waist size so you can getit you can get a bigger size with fourshorter with a shorter length ifpreferred the do come with a dressingunder front here so just around yourwaist you could you could tie it up alsoit has that Laxus thing too so most ofthe majority of the times I typicallydon't even need to use this lace becausethe waistband of the task will be strongenough to keep the pants on my waist solooking into the more the detail thesepants they do have a pocket on the leftand right under standard pant so what'sin this pocket there is an internalpocket which is quite cool so you canhold it at ease or fall in your walletin there so typically if you aretraining you don't want to have a lot bematerial on you some phone your phoneyour maybe your wallet but you just needyour keys you can actually clicking keysinto this internal back pocket and youcan actually have the protection of thatsticking with your pants also after thatyou can actually zip it up with the backpocket pretty sure what this is reallyis for me is just based on design youcan always hang dry if you want likethat whatever the case is for me I willeven put any move MN products in thewashing machine it's always gonna be anair dry with these products so right inthe front of the pants or the crotchesthere is no flap at all so it's justsewing the fabric right here so maybeshe has to look a bit I'm not too sureright that is even there but that's whatit isso when it comes onto these pants onlybit of branding they do have on thesepants will be on the left back leg andit does have a symbol right here showingit of being Lululemon product so as wetake it down to the Lord of the leg youdo have that feature of tailoring thepant so it does have a clip button whereyou can just fold it over clip it and itcomes off and the pants are just comingoff as an arrow look to it so I clickedit right there and it does have thatnarrow it does have that narrow finishright here so it does look good on apair of pants it does look it does lookgood as a pair of pants it does lookgood of a pair of trainers on so that isone of the features that I really lovedabout this pair of pants so one of thebiggest things about these pair of pantsis comfort I always looked at prayerpants I always want to feel comfortablein and I'd rather talk about a pair ofpassive truly comfortable opposed to notwearing a pants I just feel terrible inand that's the type ofthe ability I look for in any type ofproducts I don't want to have constraintI want to have a laid-back feel and wejust kind of flows with my body when itcomes on these pair pass these are veryvery comfortable with so I advise youguys to try it on yourself get yourselfa size and Fulham on these are the fourscreen also known as the olive green andpair of pants so this is a nice colorand does have a nice richness of greenso I do advise you guys to try this pairof pants out with this color but alsoI'll probably get a black as a standardcolor as well so Freddie's prep pads itdoes come down to 128 so this isCanadian so you can purchase them onlineyou can go down the link provided in theshow notes below so when it comes downto the license to train pair of pants sowithin the drawstring that is actuallyshown on the outside the pair of pantsthe cool thing about this that itactually can be put in with the interiorso it can be reversed and you can have adrawstring from the inside coming out aswell so that is a cool feature that isactually set up for you guys to do aswell so you can actually just pull upthe drawstring and you can see mitt youcan weave it through in the interior andas it goes all around you can have yourdrawstring coming from the inside out sothe most important thing about thesepair of pants they are light this is onething I love about these pair of pantsthese are meant to be trained in so youcan wear it as a comfortability piecebut also you can actually go to the gymand train these pair of pants I've doneit before I mean this is quite somethingthat is also established by the sametime they don't feel like it's like aheavy piece of fabric on your body likeunlike when it comes on a sweat pants sothe question today you guys is do youguys own a pair of licensed and trainedpants by Lululemon or any other productsby Lululemon put it let us know in thecomment section down below so yet againguys thank you guys for watching Icreate a new direction of a modern manmy name is mr.

hi everyone abby here today i'm going tobe comparing the align pants to theinline pants with pocketsbut before i get started make sure tohit that subscribe button so you canstay tuned to all my new videos droppingweekly and so you can help the channelgrowhey guys i recently announced i'm doinga giveaway i'm going to be giving awaythislululemon double strap face mask 3 packif you're interested in entering makesure togo to the video coming up on the topright and enter thereso like i said this one is the lime panthis is a 28 inch inseam in the colorwe are from space dark ice carving grayand here we have the align pants withpockets in the color truenavy i did want to also mention that theline pants with pockets i got are 25inchinseam and the line pants right here are28 inch inseamso today i'm gonna be comparing both ofthem to you umthis one right here is a pair i've hadfor a long time now and i really love iti think it's a nice flattering printand this is kind of the traditionalalign fabric um before they kind ofchanged itand right here we have the new alignedpants with pocketsso this is kind of the newer fabric herethey didalter the nulu fabric a bit because theywanted to make it more pill resistant solululemon changed the compositionand a lot of people are complaining thatit's not as buttery soft i'll let youknow if it is just as soft if it's notas softall that stuff guys so i just want totalk to you about sizing recommendationsfor the align pantso for the align pants i would go aheadand stay true to sizei know some people do size down thealign pant but i find from personalexperience when i have done that itstretches them out over timeand that's definitely not something iwant when i'm paying a lot for leggingshowever if you're someone who's inbetween sizes like let's say you're inbetween a 10 and a 12 at lululemoni would definitely go ahead and choosethe size smallerin that situation they both have thatkind of same shaping for theline pants right here which is reallyflattering from the backso this is what they look like from thefronti do want to kind of point out that theydo have different designsum obviously this one does have pocketsbut it also has different seaming sojust take note of kind of the designhere and the different seamingwe don't have that on the traditionalalign pantokay so i just wanted to mention i'mtalking about the pockets now on thesepantsso the aligned pant just has oneinterior pocket right hereactually so the interior pocket is righthereright along here and honestly you can'tfit muchinto this pocket you can maybe fit likea card or soa couple chopsticks maybe a littlehannah sanitizer and that's aboutit so coming over to the align pant withpockets you can see there's the twopockets here at the sideand i do want to mention they don't havethat interior pocket over here they tookit out on the align pant with pocketsso going to the back so i'm going toflip it over so this one actually has apocket on the back hereit's large it runs kind of from here tohere it's pretty bigi don't know if you guys can see kind ofmy fingers so this pocket can definitelyhold like a smartphonea couple cards sanitizer anything thatyou need there so coming over to thealignment with pocketswe can see that there are two pocketshere soi'm gonna go ahead and kind of putsomething in there so you guys can seewhat they can holdall right guys i have a marker here soyou guys can try to see like how deepthey goso it does go completely in thereso you guys can see kind of the sizingof that pocket now i'm going to go aheadand try these on so you guys can seewhat they look like on meall right so this is what they look likeon me these are the 25 inch inseamalign pants with pockets and true navyso it does cover my belly buttonon the back here and as you can see theyare definitely not full lengthon me so this is 25 inch inseamfor me it kind of does fit more like a 78 length like i can prefit this is what they look like on meand they are pretty high-waisted they dogo right up to my belly button hereokay so i hope you guys find thathelpful um see me try them onand now i want to talk about the fabricand the feel of theseleggings you want to say that this isdefinitely soft umto the touch and it's comfortable towear butyou can definitely notice a differenceif you do have any of the old alignedpantswith kind of that traditional nulufabric i want to say that this oneis kind of next level softness this isthat buttery softthat we know and love so this one justisn't as softi'm sorry but it's not they changed iti'm not loving that changebut in terms of trying them on they'reboth comfortable i do want to say thati was kind of gladly surprised with thepockets i thought they were gonna justlike add too much bulkto the align pant look but they honestlydidn'tthey definitely don't look you know askind of sleek i really like theminimalistic look better so for mei definitely would stick to thetraditional align pant over the alignedpant with pocketsi think that if they would have justkept it more minimalistic lookingi would have liked it more consideringthe pricethe quality the comfort the fit thecolorthe functionality everything like that iwould go ahead and give the align pantsa 9.9 out of 10and i would give the align pants withpockets an 8.9 out of 10.alright guys so that's all i have

lot morestuff and then some stuff kind of isfrom Victoria's Secret so it doubles aslike summer wear so I just want to showyou guys what I got it so the piles lookreally mixed up and everything but I'mjust going to go through it and tell youwhere it's from because it's from acouple different places but first thesetwo things are from Victoria's Secretand I got them when I was like standingin line or whatever you know how theymake you buy things when you stand inline and this is just like a nice littlebody spray I love their body sprays Ireally don't use perfume that often I'mjust like getting like a little VictoriaSecret body sprays that way you don'tinvest as much in a perfume you can geta ton of different funds for cheaper andI just they have the best sense theyalways remind me of different things cuzI've been using it for so long and thenI got a water bottle because since I dotake out my own recycling and garbagenow that I live by myself it just makesyou realize like how much water like howmany water bottles you go through andit's really horrible for killing theenvironment so I wanted to get a waterbottle and I want to drink more thanjust a water bottle when I work out sothis holds a lot more water than ever Ido a lot about them then from LululemonI got a couple sports bras I got thisyellow one and it has a little paddingin it but I think you can take them outI'm not sure I'm sure you can take themout if you wanted to because I'mprobably going to but I really like theback of it and then I got another onewith a cool back and it'smore of a Corley bright orange color andit's like a thin strap and I definitelydo like try these on because they fitlike all different sizes they've so manydifferent answer sports bras and then Igot two sports bras from Victoria'sSecret this one is like a push-up likepadded one and quite frankly I kind ofgot like convinced into buying it Idon't really think I'm gonna keep itbecause I mean I'm really self-consciousbecause I lost a lot of weightespecially in my boobs and so I don'thave boobs anymore and it's really verysaying but I don't think I would let goto the extent of like pushing them up atthe chin I don't know like if you'rereally that self-conscious I guess thisis good for you or like you need to likework out and look good but I don't knowif I'm going to keep this and then thelast sports bra or the black sports bragot from Kotori secret this one's socool it's just all black on the frontand then the back is like that in likethere's something I would totally wearlike in the summer when I don't feellike wearing um a regular bra with justa tank top I would totally wear this ifit's still cheating you wouldn't looklike you're necessarily wearing a sportsbra but the sports bras I normally dowe're all Nikki because they're fromcheerleading and so I got another Nikkione just because it was a really coolcolor so I really like this one and thenanother thing I got from Lululemon wasthey're running shorts I just love thelike feel of them they're so comfortableand they're the only really shorts thatfit me in the waist and the only thingis they're really really short and I wasgoing to go a size up but they werestill the same length and they justdidn't fit me on the waist so they don'tthey're like the littlest shorts everbut luckily I don't have a butt likegreat thing about not having a but isthat FUBU lemons are like the onlyleggings that fit me because they're sotight like just the material is amazingthese are a little be the best leggingsat work so I just got another completelyblack pair of leggings then I got like aa cover-up to like go to the gym becauseit's like freezing cold outside andsnowing and we have to walk like all theway across campus to get to the chin sothis is like one of those things that'skind of like really really warm on theinside and like it creates a lot of heatand justin michie just a Nikki like halfstep cover-up that I've been wearing tothe champ under my jacket to keep mewarm and then I also got anotherwe're out from victoria secret and thisone is because i love the color and it'sjust a mint blue bright blue it's agreat color for the spring I got a lotof this color then another shirt fromVictoria's Secret I got like a ton ofopen back shirt since I got some reallycool sports bras so this is the back andthen it's just gray in the front and I'mreally loving the Victoria Secret isstarting to just do like little thingslike this where like it's not obnoxiousit's something Victoria Secret it justlooks like a grey shirt but they stillbrand it a little bit but I just like itbecause I like really basic plain stuffand I don't like wearing a basically anadvertisement for Victoria's Secret andthen I got another tank top fromVictoria's Secret and then from Nike Igot a little pair of capri pants becausethey were like really cool and then Igot another pair of Nike Pro capris so Ireally like my capris to the gym becausethen you're not like don't feeluncomfortable in the winter because likeit's wearing shorts in the winter butthen you're not sweating from wearinglike leggings and then I got this topwhich is just a like long-sleeve minttop like this but it's down the back iscompletely open it's all ducky right nowso this would be cute like especially ifyou're just in like yoga or somethingunless it's hot yoga then don't do thatbut if you're doing yoga or somethingwhere you know you're not gonna be likeperfuse Lee's sweating and you want towear the good cool sports bra with anopen back or just like as a warm up toput this over it then I got this for ifI'm just wearing that like lounging tohave like this be like open in the backif so many of these you don't understandhow cute all these are Victoria Secret Iwanted to buy them all oh and then theyhave a ton of new like tank tops andthese are my favorite because these alsolike they brand at these really small soyou can barely see them from Victoria'sSecret they just said the little thingon the back and then in there liketie-dye and then the back is also like adrop a little drop back which is awesomewith all the shirts I got but when I'mworking out since I am moving around alot I've been like doing it with alittle twisty tie and so they look likethis in the front and then even thoughit's a low back I like twist it at thetop but you can still like see in theback see that see that see what I didthere smart think more so that is what Igot for like fitness and loungewear fromVictoria's Secretexcited to wear all that it honestly itreally wanted me to i've been like doingso well at staying in shape and eatingright in college which leads to my nextvideo which will definitely be a fitnessvideo I promise promise promise I'mgoing

angenette so it is so good to be backI'm just so happy to be home I literallyjust came back from a walk and appliedsome lip gloss to film for you guysand while I was away I did a Lululemonorder and it is absolutely one of myfavorite brands ever I started wearingtheir clothing when I was in about tententh grade so around like 2003 to 2004that's when it really kind of explodedonto the teen scene as something that'snot only wearable to do yoga and gorunning but also just in your everydaylife it became really popular andfashionable in my high school amongstlike the popular crowd and so at first Iwas just like I'm not buying like a $100dollar pair of yoga pants that'sridiculous but then I gave it a chanceand I remember my first time at thestore I tried some things on and it justkind of clicked for me like I got it andI fell in love with the brand and I'vebeen buying their clothes ever since soI guess that would definitely qualify meas a Lululemon lover even though I'veactually never really done yoga I'vetried it once or twice because I had tofor gym practice and I really it's notmy thing at all but I do wear theirclothes to go running and then I wear iteveryday like it is the most practicalthing for me and despite the fact that Istill think it's expensive I think it isworth every penny I honestly can't saythat I've ever regretted buying one oftheir pieces because I choose themcarefully and they are just the mostastounding quality I still own the firstpair of pants that I bought from Luluand they're not in perfect shape anymorethey have a little bit of pilling on theinside but the outside of them looksperfect the waistband still fits greatand I still wear them to go out and so Iwould have bought those oh my goodnessit's more than I like it they're likesix years old or something like thatlike it's crazy how long I've had thoseum and I'm I'm wearing them right nowbut it'd be kind of tough to show youthey're just blackgroov pants which were their originalkind of most favorite shape of pants soI made a little purchase they had somethings on sale I bought three itemsmoney itself Lululemon is named afterLulu Island which is what Richmond theentire area of Richmond in Vancouverused to be called I believe so that'swhere that comes from and they chose thename from a survey they did of peoplewho were just kind of a sample I supposeand the name they actually had preferredfor the brand was athletically hip whichi think is a horrible terrible name it'sjust very not catchy at allso I'm really happy that they chose thiskind of quirky name I think it's verymemorable and kind of cute that's wherethe Lulu part comes from and I thinkthat's kind of a seldom known littlething about it the company went publicin 2007 and it's just kind of gone upfrom there I think we'd have yet to seea lot of exciting things they're gonnado on they're just kind of widening theappeal of their clothes by designingsome slightly more formal pieces theycame out with some Blazers recently nowthey do coats they just are starting todo a lot more different things where itused to be designed purely for yoga butappreciated by lots of people who didn'tdo yoga if that makes any sense um soyeah that's just kind of a little bitabout the company that I wanted to tellyou guys about since its kind of fromwhere I'm from so I know some kind oflittle-known details about it because ofthat um yeah so let's get right into thehall without further ambles and by theway just at the end of the video I'mgonna give you a little update on mylife since I just got back from myinternship in Hong Kong just tell youwhat is coming up for me but in case youare just in it for the Lululemon partwhich is the title of this video let meshow you these things first so the firstthing that I got is a pair of pants ofcourse I have many of their pantsbecause I wear them every day like NBClife is very casual so their pants justfit amazingly and hide all manner ofas if that makes any sense to you guys Ithink it probably will tried a new onethis time and I've tried these on and Ireally like them they're not made fromluan so they don't have the same fabricthey're more of a softer fabric maybe alittle bit more relaxed and you can seethey have a really nice thick waistbandand they just shape really well they fitreally nicely they have a bit more of awide leg fit which is supposed to be infashion for spring and summer so I thinkthat's a good thing and I got these in asize six I always get my bottoms in sizesix and my tops in size four atLululemon you say don't like my pants tobe too tight one thing that I love aboutLululemon is the fact that like wheneverI see people wearing it and I can alwaystell from a mile away by the way in caseyou don't know like Lululemon has justgotten so hugely popular it's now on alot of TV shows so if you guys havewatched that new show show the smash inthe workshop they're like all wearingLululemon and in the last couple seasonsof Desperate Housewives they are all allalso often wearing Lululemon clothing aswell um so I just kind of noticed thatand both on screen and in real life I'mjust astounded at how it looks good on avariety of body shapes and then thesewere a little bit cheaper than usualbecause since they're not made from Lulufrom luan kind of a tongue twister thereum there were $78 and then they were onsale so I believe I paid 69 for them andthey are miles too long for my smallframe I am just about 5'4 and they aregood three inches too long even thoughthey're not the tall variety so a lot oftheir pants do tend to fit longer allLululemon stores will do freealterations for you not just on pantsbut on other things as well and theydon't even care if you've worn themalready like if you maybe forget to doit or notice later after you've wornthem or already purchase them they justdon't mind at all you just go in and aslong as it's their merchandise be it oldor new they will do the alteration foryou and they do a really great job withthe alterI have to say like I can actually so andso usually I might just skip that intoit myself but they just do an awesomejob so I wouldn't do it myself becausethey just have great machines andamazing customer servicethe second item that I got withoutfurther ado is the yoga is love yogieveryday yogi tea every yogi team anywayand this is originally about $50 and Igot it for 34 from the sale and it'snice because unlike their usual blackteas I forget what they're called theyhave them in all different colors reallyand they are also the crewneck style andthis one fits a little bit more looselyand it's a little bit longer as well Itried it on already to see how it fitand I really really liked it I mean thislabel is just on the inside so you can'tsee that which is good because I did Iwould like that we can bit silly reallysince I don't do yoga to have that Idon't know be on the outside um but umin case you're wondering why I wouldspend like $30 on a black t-shirt isbecause if I buy black t-shirt from Gapand I wear it for a few months it'sgonna start to show where if I buy ablack t-shirt from Lululemon I'll paymaybe like $10 extra maybe a bit moredepending on sale or no sale and it willlast me for yearslike I'm not even kidding I know peoplesay that oh about a lot of brands likeoh I have this t-shirt from forever 21that lasted for three years yeah okay ithappens sometimes but sometimes that candepend on how often you wear it as wellwhereas with Lululemon clothing you canwear them to death and they will stilllast the fabric that they use is justreally good quality you do have to becareful that you don't put it in thedryer with pretty much everything thatthey sell you really don't want to dothat and then the final item that I gotthat wasn't on sale so this was mylittle splurge this is the endlesscircle scarf they've been doing like Isaid a lot of different accessories thataren't you know what they used to dobefore and so this is just in the coloraqua and it is just the prettiest blueyminty green and it'sthe softest fabric it's like a reallynice worn and sort of soft t-shirt andlet me try it on for you it doesn'treally go with this jacket too wellwhich is also from Lululemon but stillwant to try it on anyway I really reallylike the way this looks and I think thecolor is really pretty with my pale skinI just absolutely love it for spring andI can wear it with like a white t-shirtor a dress with a coat without a coatI'm just so in love with this scarf soit was worth every penny that I paid forit and I'll insert the price right herebecause I just don't remember other thanthat it was expensive and I hesitatedfor like two seconds and then I boughtit because I love it in my hair startingto perk up a little bit now oh wellanyway so yeah that's my littleLululemon purchase and my kind ofthoughts on the brand in general if youguys would like to see a Lululemoncollection video where I go through theother clothes that I bought and lovedfrom them over the years I think thatwould be a really fun video to make I'mjust not really sure whether you guysare interested enough in Lululemon andkind of athletic wear that is versatileto Merrit making that video but I thinkit might be so yes that is in aboutLululemon and just to give you a quicklittle update um now that I'm back fromHong Kong and very slowly getting overmy jet lag it's a long process and it'sa tough one because I find myselfgetting tired at weird times during theday so normally like with jet lag youwould get tired like early at night ornot be able to sleep in or you knowsleep in too late depending on which wayyou go with Europe that's kind of whathappens one way or the other but withthis sort of Asia jet lag I'm just allover the place so I'm awake right nowbut who knows in an hour I might besound asleep um and I'm trying to getsome work done right now because I'mslowly sliding back into revision mode Ihave two exams- my conversion exams before I startwork to get done and those are criminaland administrative law and neither ofthem are very much fun and the exams arein mid May so I have to start gettingyou know back into that kind of ASAP soI'm still planning on filming lots ofvideos I have quite a few hauls comingup because I ordered some things and Idid a swap with Amanda rain that'scoming up soon as well I received herpackage and I absolutely lovedeverything she got me so I need to showit to you guysso there will be some hauls for surecoming up and then some beauty tutorialsand then I know a lot of you guys havebeen asking me on kind of eating diettips not that I want to diet but justkind of what I eat to stay looking goodand feeling good and I hesitated aboutit for a really long time before Idecided that it was a good idea becauseI know it can be really controversialsometimes to do videos about food but Ithink I have a pretty good relationshipwith food and I just think it's a reallyinteresting topic because we live in anage of extremes where people either eatreally badly or really restrictive lyand so I don't know I just kind of wantto share my thoughts and tips on it withyou guys and probably eventually somerecipes - I know it's a little bit offof the Beauty kind of area and radar orwhatever but this is a very mix channelwhere I vlog and do Beauty videos and soit's really no surprise that I would dothat kind of video when I feel that it'sright so yeah that's kind of it for meum cut me a little bit of slack in termsof putting videos all the time I'm stillparticipating in vlog gear and doingquite a bit of videos I feel like I didpretty good while I was in Hong Kong Ididn't put up every single day butusually if I need to put up every singleday I did every other day and that'skind of the aim for the next littlewhile as well as to do every other dayor like every you know three days orsomething like that so several videos aweek just because I really enjoy themand they're just a really nice break forme as well from all the heavy law stuffso yeah I guess that's basically it onwhat's happening in my life right nowlittle someone I missed very much whileI was away for six weeks wanted to sayhi this is my cat fufu for those of youwho might have been recently subscribedI haven't actually done a lot of videosincluding him I don't think that heloves being on camera he is just alittle bit camera shy sometimes but thecamera does love him I mean okay let metry and give you a closer look at thoseeyes anyway he's my baby and I love himhe is a nine year old rag doll but he'sstill just my baby he's still a kittenin my eyes and oh he's happy todayyes he's mommy's scratchies um yeah Idon't know I just thought I would showyou fufu that is it from the both of usin terms of what we had to say for anupdate and boof who wants to also saythat he doesn't think that he needs anyLululemon clothes because he is justnaturally always outfitted

welcome back to my channel everyone Iwent on a bit of a shopping spree someof the things I bought are really cheapand then the other ones are sort ofexpensive so it's good I've got a rangeand a mixture of things to show youright now I'm on prac so I'm at you needto learn to become a pram schoolteacherso a lot of my clothes will be for pracand then I bought some other stuff forthe gym and just some everyday stuff solet's get right into it lately I've beentrying to save my money and look forthings that look expensive but I reallycheap so I went to this store calledpaper scissors which is that Miranda I'mnot sure where else it is but it was socheap and I found some really coolthings from there the first things I gotwere these pants they're really cool Ireally like how they tie it around yourwaist they're high-waisted and they'requite big and baggy my body size I don'thave really skinny legs so I really likethese sort of oversized floppy pantswhich accentuate a smaller waist andhide my legs and I think they're veryteacher appropriate and if you are goingto have some type of line pattern onyour clothing like pants tops dresses itis better that they go verticallybecause it elongate your body it makesyou look skinnier whereas if it'shorizontal it actually makes you lookwiderthey were $14 so that's crazy andnormally I would spend you know $70 onpants like that at Zara the next thing Igot again was some paper scissors andit's like a navy blue it looked quitewide but because when you tie thistogether it sort of gathers it alltogether at the top so it's just sort oflike a fitted suit cigarette pant andit's got the gold detail on the zippersI'll either wear them with these tannedboots or I would wear them with like myflat teaching shoes like that because Ithink these are really chic and theylook really expensive and I like themand things ones were $19.99so again super cheap the last thing Igot from paper and scissors were thesepants so these are high-waisted as wellthey're not as flared as the otherstrapping ones they're more of a cuffedtailored cigarette pant and I reallylike them because I feel like they lookreally classy and chic and I can dressthem up or down depending what type Ihave with it and these were the cheapestthing I bought from paper instances andthey came down to $12 I guess from Zarathey'd be $70 so it was so worth it forme one of my favorite things I boughtwas this crop top from cotton on bodynow lots of the time I don't get croptops from cotton on body because I feellike they stretch really easily all ofmy other ones are really floppy now andthe elastic has completely given butwith this one I like how the bottom partthe whole thing is elastic so this bigband here is just this big thick elasticband that I love this detail at the topwhere it's sort of see-throughand the back is really cool the onlynegative about this is that I have tohave the straps tightened all the waywhich makes these bits go floppy it'sreally hard to explain so I'm gonna haveto chop them and sew them back togetherbut anyway I love this crop top and Ican't wait to workout in it that one was25 dollars the other thing I bought fromcotton um but it was this black braletteI'm obsessed with bralette I thinkthey're so pretty I don't have any boobsso I can wear these all the time Ipretty much need no support and becauseI have no boobs I just would rather wearlike a bralette rather than paddingbecause even when I wear padding I justlook like a smaller a so I'd rather justaccept I have no boobs and not trying tolook like I do to have them they came inall different colors but as far as likeones array and things like that go Ilove black wear it underneath like afloppy white shirt and that would lookreally cool and chill so I love that andthat one was 1495 I believe yes thatalmost 1495 I also bought this jacket sothis jacket is from dollar girl and thatis a nice little cheap store in Sydneythat you can buy things from I actuallyfound one in witchery a couple of weeksago that I loved and it was $400 andthen last night I was just walking pastall the girl and I saw this and it was$80 so $80 for a big trench coat isquite good then here's the most excitingpart I had never been to Lululemonbefore lots of the girls I follow on youand the fitness people I see onInstagram they're all obsessed withLululemon and I didn't even know thatAustralia had a Lululemon until Igoogled it and I found out that therewas one in the city I am in love I'vesaid before I'm very picky with type asI have quite chunky thighs I have a bigbum and have a small waistI felt very unprepared in these typesweren't necessarily my favorite lookingI love them I think they're beautifulbut um there were definitely the mostcomfortable and if you are really pickylike me and you like them high waistedand really tight and you want to bendaround and not have to adjust your typeI highly suggest these types the firstones I got were these and they arecalled the seamlessly straight crop andI bought these ones because the wholething is like elasticated it's reallyreally hard to explain I don't know ifyou can see but the whole thing has likethese little elastic ripping height andthe waistband is like the same elasticribbing and seriously suck you in somuch I like that they're cropped becauseI'll probably wear these in summer and Ithink they're very timeless they're noton a specific trend so it's not likethey're leopard print or they're likeAztec while those prints come in and outI like stuff like black and gray that isjust in forever so I'll just wear theseuntil they're dead they were originally$99 and I got them for 60 so I reallyreally liked them the next types Ibought are going to look a bit boringbut I swear these are the ones I'm mostexcited forthey are honestly just plain black tiesthey are so high-waisted I'm obsessedwith them so I love how high-waistedthey are they fit amazing they'rehonestly just plain black they're quitethick and I really like that because Ifeel like the thicker tights are themore they suck you in they were 109dollars although that's quite expensivefor plain black tights I can't tell youhow many black tights I've gone throughI probably have like 10 in my drawer andbecause I wear them three times my buttis so big that it stretches them andthen I have to pull them up all the timeso I thought screw it I'm just going toinvest in some really good expensiveblack tights that I cantap it ever the next type I got werethese ones called the Wonder underpantroll down not even the print that I'mobsessed with it's like the feel of themand how they suck you in and they arereally high waisted and I honestlycannot wait to work out in these there'ssort of like a really faint leopardprint I guess but like a gray and blackleopard print there were some more typeslike this that I loved and they had likethis really cool feather print on thembut I thought there's one more versatileand I not only will I wear these to thegym but I can just put like a floppywhite shirt with like my black and whiteNikes and it led the jacket and I couldjust wear that to uni I also boughtanother bra and it was from bonds sobonds was having like a 40% off sale soI got this for like fourteen dollars andembarrassingly enough it's called likemy first bra but I'm obsessed with themanything that's called my first bra giveit to me I like that it's got a littlebit of padding so it's like if you getcold you like can't tell you're cold youknow what I mean you can't see yournipples the last thing I've purchased isactually this snow jacket from a brandcalled color web and it's cool becauseyou can wear it like a day look as wellso I've been wearing this to uni justlike a normal hoodie underneath so it'sgot a 10k rating

unless I'm beingchased or likes I see other peoplerunning up my goai there's something weall major we're running away fromsomething bad but the pants smell goodyeah what about support for the bra doyou like are there any sports bras thatdon't hurt when you're having no onehiker I'm a hikerand I I stay at a wouldn't live milesper hour that's a good pointer I thinkwe each do different types of workoutsthis one does some hardcore working outor do you Orangetheory and it's just youspend a lot of time on the treadmill Ialways start on the treadmill I my pantsfall down pants on the ground lookinglike a fool with your pants on theground wait err what kind of workoutsdid you um as few as possible but when Ido work out I have a peloton bike uhmostly because I don't like to leave myhouse and you know I like kind of beingin one position and I know cuz I'musually like kind of bit over it's notI'm usually bent over and I feel like Idon't do a lot of up and down likemoving to stretch it has you stay forone position for me yeah but I thinkthese work amazingly as spent in oh Iwant them they're really cute right nowso I know I said that they felt likethey were staying in place but I keepfinding myself going like this so it iskind of falling I think it's also justpreference I like it to beI think everyone every woman alive and Iam going on a limb speaking for all ofus we like a peds to stay up we donothing is that crazy we doconcerned with armpits why he shouldchange outfits before it gets a littletoo stinky in here yeah I mean goodstart though so far so goodyeah let's go we are all wearing Jimshark which is a brand that I have beenvery curious about this is a higherimpact than the airy so everything ismore snug the sports bras are moreheavy-duty and these are a little moreexpensive than the airy stuff but not bymuchso what do you guys think I really likethe color I like the aesthetic of it allsure I like that these have pockets I'venever seen legging with pockets but Ithink this is just I'm not a leggingconnoisseur never seen it's gonna changeyour life it's a game changer yeah I putmy keys in here whoalike you said Lauren yeah yeah that'sthat I like again I have a torso issueso they just teach are gonna be wherethey're gonna be but it looks good yeahI do like them and I like the color thebra no it feels there's am wearing ashirt under it's not too flashy but Ireally like the bra and it's likesupportive it's you started to get intoit but you're okay with it now it was sohard to get into yeah I don't know ifit's because of the back of the back islike really crisscross oh that's reallyhard when you're sweaty to get in andout of so the bra looks will be easieryeah I just didn't realize it was a fastchange you know but it's supersupportive I love that and the top youcan wear is like a cute little crop topthis is what didn't see that this looksso cool I will say I'm not comfortablein it at all I usually wear a small insports bras but this around my neck isalready kind of like rubbing me a littlebit I don't know if I'm read it all butit feels like it's like rubbing me Rachdo you feel like maybe high cuts thehigh cut sports bra trend is just notfor you I feel like it fits me here it'sjust this piece that makes me feel likeit's wrong something's wrong like it'stoo tight you try to get crafty and itlooks cool but like it's not funlike this is cute for like a photo opbut it cannot keep your functionalityI'm like literally a mildlyclaustrophobic clusters living so I'mlike kind of mildly freaking out rightnowbut I'm gonna move on to the pants whichI feel like I'm pretty comfortable lookwe got the bus start with itDarren don't even start with mewell write me let me say these werereally hard for me to get into like kindof like your bra it was like I thought Iwas like I'm not gonna be able to wearthese but they're really tight whichmeans they probably won't come down butsomething that I do not love about thesepants which I should I knowoh gee oh my god Becky look at her buttthe reason why it looks so good is onebecause it's so tight but also they hadthese seams right here yeahlike puffy in this like attractive waywhich aesthetically I appreciate butfrom comfortability it's not like I canfeel this seam on my butt and like feelit like feel how rough that is it's likethat on the inside it's like hard justdon't get a hemorrhoid why would sheokay no yes so here's this reallyprocess it was it literally was likeputting on pantyhose which I wasconcerned about until they got here sojust the leg part is really tight like apantyhose which is fine that's greatI've you know my calves need support tomy complaints aren't are I can feel allthe seamsoh no don't like that like teeth yeahsureOh terrible you should be called Jimgums nagging complaint is this waistbandis really short for a high waistbandusually they are like this thick yeahand so the beauty of these of like highwaist bands is they double up the fabricaround your pooch so this it's only onepiece of fabric and here from here tohere is two so that's really flatteringand I'm only getting the doublewaistband fabrics from here to here andso it's not like smoothing out the way Iwould prefer things just be smooths outwhich just means that I feel veryexposed here and it feels very thin hereI mean but also great date pants I loveour priorities out was no different hewould eat that up look of it not thatboth really cute this is a like clearlya high impact sports bra which it's notsomething I am concerned about but ifyou are 1 billion straps and then thelittle cookie thing which I actually Ithought I was annoying but now I'm likeyeah it'd be so easy to get out of thisproblem when you're funny yeah unhook ityeah I will say overall Jim shark hasbeen the most interesting to look at theinteresting colors the interestingdesigns like I appreciate the effort andmaking it look fun and original becauseI have seen one too many sports braslike I was just wearing before but I dothink there's some elements of it thatneeds to be worked out still like theseams shouldn't feel like they feel butmaybe they wear down on their suits Iguess I'm just something so much likeman if these pants stay up then I willdeal with you on comfort because it'smore important to me that my pants dayup so should we let's do the squat testwhich I guess is more the squat test isyou all have to look through my buckokay Lucy no have we tried throwingwater on ourselvesyeah first what color show sweat I'm notwearing it wow that's bad okay okay itlike bounced off her no I don't feel anywetnessI'm not going next drew I'm good I justwant that much I was gonna keep oncalling what dry moisture managementwhat is unwiseit means bullish that means they're abunch of liars I mean what did youexpect mooster off your skin to helpkeep you dry good place like expectingit to like repel yes are my expectationsrealistic little it's fabric you knowlike it's gonna get wetdon't be cold dry dry pants true you doknow are they falling down where do notgo in anywhere they're already down Imean they feel the same do you feelthese seams on your good no they're seemthere's like a seam like right in hereand it goes downnot just come from the inside no myseams aren't like that that sharp stuffbut it's just this parts are so thepants are great I need some work don'tblame gym shirt it's for the bad and webelieve a brother thing exactly I need alot of help but this hands I think asfar as staying up they do should wechange we should change it to the nextround

excited about youroutfit this is the thing like I saidbefore like I I don't care what leggingsare when I buy them I'm like coolthey'll work when I'm walking but I mustsay these are like doe baths like theylive up to the hype what makes you lovethem so muchwake it up first of all you look greatin all the language you look like afitness stormtrooper I just feel like solike Katniss Everdeen like like like I'mbout to fence and it's just I think thelogos in gold is it not yeah fear andthey fit so well like they feel likenothing is going anywhere that theperfect amount of high-waisted they'reflattering yeah like they're expensivebut these like get it this is the onething like I get this what why what isit for other than like cosmetic cute youknow you're when you go to the storeyeah but the bra is also I think cute Iwill say for me if you have a largerchest size this I feel so secure it likenothing is seamless it does roundanywhere it look like you were born withthat on what your back good this is goodthis is good so apparently this bra is a32e which is really hard to find andtechnically that's my bra size like 32triple you know yeah where you have togo take our measurements into the wildand find the perfect bra do it CaptainUnderpants like you really could lookgood at anything even though it wasreally hard to put on like it for asecond I thought it was too small butlike I feel like a warrior you know youlook freaking hotmight want to note that although it's a32 II which I'm appreciative of it's $98which is like Lauren you seemed veryreserved I look this is definitely adifferent fabric than all the fabrics ofLululemon's that I've tried and notliked because they fall down so quicklymm-hmm it feels it already feels like 10times better than the waist bandsthe other ones I warned ya um it oddlyfeels a little too big and this is asize down then the other Louisvillewomen so that feels weird the problem isthese are fleece-lined they'recold-weather working out I'm very veryhot sweaty human and it worries me if Iwere to work out in these inside not inDenver these also come with a drawstringoh not too big anymore and I just wantto complain about what we think yeah ohthis is very good so first of all thisbra 108 dollarsI didn't even spend that on bras that Idon't have to wash every time I wearthem um second of all it was really hardto put onI couldn't undo it and this is my brathis is my true bra size bra size yesI'm falling yeah okay I don't reallyknow how to explain that there's moldingin here and it's in the wrong placeit's very Center doesn't say there'smolds in here I was like what's more itis time for you to take a showersure you need to take a shower this istoo tight and then the boobs are in thewrong spot yeah hundred and eightdollars okay the back of the bed I'msorry for this much money I don't knowyou should be like massaging my leg orproducing cookies it just is like soexpected it's not all his loss don'tfeel so sad why are you so sad do youever just go on the ball to do an abworkout and then you just put asidetheseare you able to do you are you lookingfor some you know human that's Howardwe're gonna help me they're not

[Music]hi everyone avi heretoday i'm going to be reviewing thelululemon air wrap pullover hoodiebut before i get started make sure tohit that subscribe button so you canstay tuned to all my new videos droppingweeklyand so you can help the channel grow sothis is the airwrap pullover hoodie inthe colorpink punch and i did buy this in a size12.all right guys i do want to let you knowthat i purchased this airwrap hoodiefrom the we made too much section lastweek and i've been testing it out youknow since i've got it i've had it forabout a week now and i actually reallylike it a lotin terms of sizing recommendations iwould highly recommend that you do staytrue to sizei'm typically a size 12 in little lemonhoodies and i did buy this in a size 12as wellso now i'm going to show you guys how itdoes look on me i'm going to go aheadand try it onalright guys so this is what it lookslike on me once again this is thelululemon airwrap hoodie in the colorpink punch and a size 12.i got this in a size 12 which is my trueto size for lululemon hoodies and i'drecommend that you guys do get in trueto sizebecause although it is like an oversizedfit it's mostly just oversized in thearms hereand the body is just like true to size ido like it it's just likea little bit oversized so nothing islike clinging to youit does have that like spacerconstruction so it's nice and like flowyand airy in the wayit is made and it's weight of the luxecream fabric which is smoothit is cool to the skin and it's slick tothe touch and nice and softit's one of my favorite fabrics fromlululemonand i really do like the color here ithink it looks way better in person thani did onlineas you can see it's definitely a lotmore like orange reddish looking onlinebut in person it's more of like apinkishpeach color and i do really like iti think the fit is nice and flatteringit's not too big not too largethe arms are oversized but i honestlydon't mind this i really like the lookof thisadditionally guys one last feature aboutthis is that you can go ahead and likecinch the waist if you want to so that'sanother function of this that is greatso it does have this little string righthere you just go ahead and pull thisto your desired lengthand then you kind of just like tie itto hold the position there and nowthe waist is cinchedi really like it cinched i like it theother way as well i think it's greatthat you can kind of customize it andwear it both waysand to undo it super easy just kind ofundo that knotstretch it back out and there we goi love that this cinch is so easy itactually works because a lot of theitems that do have cinches they justlike don't cinch properlyand they'll send you maybe like half ofit not the other side but this one worksthrough and throughand it is a waist length hoodie i reallylove that it's not cropped because ilike having crops every once in a whilebut primarily i do like to wear likewaist lengthfull length hoodies and shirts and thiscolor actuallyi think it can go with a lot ofdifferent items as you can see i'mmatching it with likeblack and orange but it can honestly gowith like jeansit can go with navy blue it can go withyou knowmarble print like you see on the modelhere this can go with a lotand i really love this color i thinkit's perfect for like spring falleven summer on my cooler days because itis nice and airyokay guys so i also wanted to mentionwhen i was umlike looking into purchasing thisreading some of the comments i saw thatsome people said thatit felt like they were like choking whenthey were wearing this you knowsometimes cessation like thati will let you know that i have not hadthat experience at all i find this supercomfortableno pressure whatsoever on my neck um i'mthinking maybe if you size down theremight be an issue with like the neckbeing too small i don't know buti haven't had that issue guys so i justwant to quickly show you guys the tag incaseanyone's interested in any of thatinformationhere it is for you so now i just want totalk aboutkind of the logo so this one does havethe traditionallululemon silver logo on the back hereand i love the placement of it and thecolor of the logo is definitelynoticeable so one thing i like aboutthis hoodie is that it hasreally big pocket it's just one pocketbut it has two zippers on both sidesand the zippers are smooth on both sideshereand the pocket is huge guys like it'slike a nice kangaroo style pocket goesall the way throughand it does have a little pouch insidehere that can hold your cell phonecredit card anything else you wantinside of there securelyyou can definitely fit you know a waterbottle guys a 500 milliliter waterbottleone thing that you might not beexpecting from this air wrap hoodie isthat it hasa gigantic hood so i actually reallylike the hood on this but it ishuge guys i'm talking the hood literallycomes down and covers my entire face asyou can seeit's gigantic i mean if it's rainingyou're gonna stay dry butthe hood is huge all right guys so justconsidering the pricethe quality the color the durability thefunctionalityand the fit of this air wrap hoodie iwould go ahead and give it a 9.6 out of10.i definitely do give it a thumbs up andlike i said i did buy this on we madetoo muchfor that sale price i think it's a greatdeal would i buy it on regular priceprobably not i might if there's a colorthat i really like but if i'm tellingyou if this goes on we made too muchagain another color i'm definitely goingto pick one up because i like it thatmuchand as it is currently on we made toomuch in size0 to 14 all in stock in canada and theunited statesi will go ahead and put a link in thedescription for you guys if you areinterested in buying thisand i'll put a link to the regular oneas well if you guys want

bagand it was just different and also Iactually wanted to buy the black baghowever the black bag in this style ofgym bag is a different material thismaterial is like a nylon materials ablack one apparently I don't rememberwhat kind of material it was but itpicks up a lot of lint anyways as youcan see it comes with these straps letme just put this up these straps righthere I'm actually keep these unbuttonedso I can access the bag pretty quicklybut comes with these awesome straps hereand it also comes with this amazingblack and white strap with a pad thatslides around which is perfect it's verysturdy and has like reflective threadgoing through it so if you were to carrythis at night people would be able tosee that I really like the strap and heywait in the middle of this bag as youcan see it might look like it's astraight zipper right now but if I leanit this way toward you guys the zipperis actually on a diagonal so the zipperstarts up here and it ends down here Iabsolutely love that feature becausewhen you openyou access more of the bag when it's ona diagonal now let's get into the bag Idon't carry clothes or things to showerafter the gym because I actually liveliterally a 5 minute drive to the gymactually that's being really generousprobably like a three minute drive tothe gym so I don't shower at the gym Iprefer to shower at home so I don'tbring too many things so these are myessentials for my workout andpost-workout so what I carry is in herein the main compartment I have a towelwhich I use to wipe myself off after Iworkout or I bring this to the treadmillor the elliptical when I'm doing cardioon Carter day which I absolutely hatecardio day but anyways also I have myprotein right now what's in here is darkchocolate protein by Kaizen or Kaizen Idon't know how to pronounce the brandit's a natural isolate protein and thenat the bottom this white stuff isglutamine which is a muscle repair so ithelps your muscles recover faster thisshaker bottle I got from GNC and Iabsolutely love it because it's a goodsize it's not was monstrous ones thattake up a lot of space so I find thatthis is perfect for what I need down atthe bottom right here is my workouts Ihave programs in here slash doodles tohave like a bunch of different ones sowhen I go into the gym I kind of justflipped through what day I'm working onand pick whatever one because I need aprogram if I don't have a program I findmyself to be very lost in the gym andjust end up losing track of time and notknowing how much I've gotten done andyeah it's not good so as you can see inthis bag right here the first thing yousee is this amazing quote which sayssore today strong tomorrow and it's sewnin on this leather I don't actually Idon't know if this is leather and itjust has a nice quote in there tomotivate you when you open your bag sothat's awesome on this side of the bagright here it has two zipper pockets uphereit has a little writing neces tabletwhich is where I leave my tablet my iPadbecause I need to watch something onYouTube or Netflix while I'm doingcardio because like I said before Iabsolutely hate cardio day it's my leastfavorite thing to do don't like Chadmiles I don't like the ellipticals I donot like running outside just cardio isnot my thingbut you have to do it and the only way Ican do it is if I have my iPad otherwiseI'm gonna only be doing like a 5 to 10minute cardio so what else I have inhere is just an old membership card withgood life and then these keys are for mybike which I take in the summersometimes to ride to the gym so that'sthe first zipper the second zipper whichis the mesh the zipper here it actuallycomes with this neat paint hair tieso it's an emergency hair tie if youdon't have one you can just take thisone off and use this as a hair tie whichis awesomeif you open this it says keys chopsticksand other easily lost items which is aperfect pocket for a lot of things Icurrently have in here a bunch of stuffI have my iPod headphones my locker lockwhich is like totally beat up and rippedand the oops my I phone / iPod holderwhich I wear it's an armband some of mypants don't have pockets in them so Ineed to wear this on certain days when Ihave those pants on and then I also havetwo headbands one from Lululemon Iabsolutely love this one because it'sthick and it's tile so you can adjusthow tight it is on your head and becauseit's thick it holds back all theflyaways which is nice this one is likemy emergency headband if I forget myLululemon one because the one thing Ican't stand is working out with hairs inmy face and I have a lot of flyawaysaround my face so yeah so I'm going totry this bag aroundso this is the other side as you can seeit has three separate pockets on thisside of the bagthis one says blister kit which I do notkeep blister a blister kit in there butI do have a few band-aids foremergencies and then here it says sockswhich I do keep a pair of socks becausesometimes I wear flip-flops or sandalsto the gym and I forget to bring sockssometimes and then on this side it saysdeodorant now some of you guys know thatI don't worry do do it anymore if youwant to know more about that then I willlink a video right hereor I'll leave a link down below in thedescription box yeah I haven't worndeodorant in almost a year now I have anatural remedy that works for me andit's worked better than any do ever usedso anyways in the deodorant pocket Iactually have my workout gloves nowthese are really old and it's funnybecause when I initially bought theseworkout gloves I didn't buy them to workout cuz I bought these in high schooland I actually bought them for a costumebecause I was dressed up as Tomb Raiderand she wears gloves I think or so Ithought that she wore gloves I got theseat Walmart it's athletic workshowever they are beat up now there'sactually a hole right here which isn'tvery attractive and as you can seethere's threads everywhere so these arejust really old gloves and I plan to buynew ones I'm actually looking at a pairof Nike ones I just haven't found ones Ilike because I'm very particular withthe colors that's pretty much it for theinside bag but you'll find out what thisis let's go to this side so on this sideI have my water bottle because well thispocket says h2o that's good so I do keepmy water ball in there what's awesomeabout this bag a lot of people likedabout this bag is this particular pocketright here now what's special about thispocket is that if you unzip it it's thishuge pocket but you keep your Jimmyshoes in I actually use the wash bagthat came with this gym bag this issupposed to be like you know if you'retaking a shower at the gym or if you gofor a swim or something you put it inthis bag but since I don't shout at thegym because I'm so close to the gym Iuse this to keep my shoes in there toprevent the inside of this bag fromgetting dirty because I can wash thisbut I'm not gonna throw this bag in thelaundry anyways so I don't find that myshoes stink so this pocket is great interms of keeping other things clean sothese are the gym shoes I have right nowthey are the Nike freeze I absolutelylove these for my weight training thesoles are a little bit flatter they'renot as thick like they are for runningand they're super super light and thebottom is very flexible look at thatanyway so these are the shoes that I'musing and I'm actually looking for a newpair right now because these are beat upas you can see the bottoms are grossbecause I've worn these outside now sothese are where I keep my shoes and thisis where it says to keep your shoes andthen down here there's actually a littlepocket as well where it says what theFluffy's so this is where you keep yourflip-flops I don't know showerflip-flops if you wear them into theshower but I usually wear my flip-flopsto the gym so they never end up in thebag so as you can see it goes into thebag like this which is awesome butanother thing that's great is that ifyou don't use this shoe pocket you caneasily fold this up like roll it downand there's actually a clip as you cansee there's like a little thing here youcan roll this up if you're not usingthat compartment and clip it to theattachment down below and then you'llhave an open bag so that thing won't goin there but I do use it so that'sstaying to the other side of the gym bagI actually just did this in because Ialready ate the ones that I brought tothe gym earlier I keep that in therebecause this has a pocket that saysbanana hammock how cute is that so I dokeep it banana in there just because itdoes say banana hammock sometimes Iusually just carry my banana in sothere's athis is the backside of egg whichactually has another zipper which youcan put more stuff in there but I don'tuse this plug for anything but I keepthe straps that came with itthis strap actually if you zip up thisstrap actually attaches on this straphere and it goes across to the otherstrap on the diagonal side and what itdoes is if you do yoga you can carry ayoga mat that will be held on to the bagand it won't move anywhere so you cancarry it with a yoga yoga mat on topwhich is coolso this is the front of the bag whichyou guys saw earlier I'm sure you guysnoticed already throughout this videothat there's rose gold hardwareeverywhere which I find super adorablefor gym bag Sundays if you unbutton thisso in here I have a protein bar actuallyreally like this protein bar I haven'ttried the other flavors but I actuallyreally like this one this is the cocoaraspberry flavor it's got 15 grams ofprotein hundred fifty calories sevengrams of fiber and the important thingis that it only has one gram of sugarthis in the banana usually helps me ifI'm hungry after my workout beforecardio or before I hit the gym I gethungry so have a budget and I had thatbar in the snacks pocket which makessense and then here honestly I usuallyjust throw my phone in the big pocketbut you can slip your phone in hereobviously for organization if you areOCD and want to follow the labels andthen here it has a pocket for sunscreenI have my gym membership in here as wellso I keep that in this pocket and thatpretty much concludes the bag I didn'tshow you guys in the clip before but atthe bottom of this bag actually has likea leather I don't think this is leatherbut it has like a leather looking panelat the bottom so it keeps the bottom ofthe bag from getting too dirty so I justwant to give you guys my final thoughtson this bag I absolutely love this bagand I thought it was very appropriatefor me to upgrade from my old one sincemy old one was just a middle compartmentwith no pockets inside and a frontzipper pocket and I would just geteverything lost in there so now that Ihave this gym bag it's nice to havepocketsorganize my stuff in there now for someof you it might be too many pockets foryou I'm not really sure on yourpreference but it is a lot of pockets inthere so if you're not into that thenmaybe this bag isn't for you anotherthing that I like with this bag is thatit's a really good size for not just thegym but you can take this bag and use itfor like a weekender trip or you know anovernight stay which is great so it'snot restricted as a gym bag which is ahuge plus for me now on that note thisgym bag I think would be very perfectfor those who are always on the go so ifyou go from work straight to the gymwhich I do that a lot it's a great bagfor that because there is a lot of spaceso you can pack a lot of things then youcan pack snacks pack your clothes pack atowel all those things can fit in hereand it's a really good size if you onlyneed a gym bag that carries a few thingsthis might not be the bag for you and ifyou are going to get this bag it isavailable in other colors unfortunatelythis one in particular isn't availableit's designed for some reason theystopped making it after March like Irealized after I uploaded this springhaul video that they sold out and thenthey weren't going to make it anymore Idon't think because the pattern for thisbag isn't an option so they do have newpatterns in the same style of bag whichare still very amazing patterns but ifyou are gonna get this bag do not getthe black one stay away from the blackone because I saw the black one inperson and I read reviews on it thoughtthe black bag collects a lot of lint andif you were to go in the store and ifyou see the black bag and feel it forsome reason the just the black bag is adifferent material than these ones theones with designs and stuff I don't knowit's that it's that weird smooth mattematerial that you know we just collect alot of dust dirt and lint and it's justnot attractive and it's not cute sodefinitely stick with the ones withpatterns and plus if you're gonna getgym bag and spend a lot of money may aswell make it a cool design and make itunique and stand out which is why Ichose this one because it's so differentanyways that pretty much concludes myvideo for today I hope that for those ofyou who were on the fence about this bagthat I helped you out a bit to make adecision on whether you want it or notbecause it is a pricey bag

what's up everybody so today I ambringing you guys my first review or Iguess it's really a product comparisonof the Nike legendary sculpt tight pantsversus the Lululemon high x pants thatthey have so in the luan fabric materialso I purchased my very first pair ofLululemon pants about I want to saymaybe two weeks ago and I've beentesting them out and you know I'm prettysatisfied with them and something justyou know a lightbulb hip and I was likewell what if I compared it to the Nikesculpt will the Nike legendary sculpttight pant which is kind of a littlesimilar with a high waisted type ofshape so that's what I'm going to bringto you to you guys today and I'm gonnapretty much compare them give you prosand cons and let you know which one isactually worth the money and which oneand you know is off so I've had theskull the Nike sculpt tight pantsfor I want to say over a year now so Ihave actually gotten some really goodwear and tear out of them I have thepants and I have the Capri style so Ican let you guys know which one I preferand then I just recently purchased theLululemon high-time pants and those Ipurchased about two weeks ago so I'mgoing to give you guys a comparison I'mgoing to first talk about the Nikesculpt the Nike legendary sculpt pantwhich um is Nikes high waisted leggingsbasically and so that one retails for110 dollars on the nike website and theypretty much say it's for trainingpurposes it's a training tight you canuse I mean I basically bought them onebecause I liked a high-waisted style butyou know it's great for yoga andeverything my overall will let me firstgo into a little bit more productdetails and I'm reading it straight offtheir website for you guys so let's see- good good - let me find it so they saythat it's pretty much a 70 centimeterinseam based on the size medium and thefabric is a the body of the fabric isdry fit 80 percent polyester 20 percentelastin and then says gusset lining notreally sure what that means but it's dryfit 100% polyester and it is machinewashable and they pretty much are sayingthat you know it has a dry fit fabricwhich helps keep you dry and comfortablewhich is nike signature fabric and youknow stay cover the power mesh waistbandsits high on your waist to help minimizecreases and lines for a smooth look andkeep you covered when blend and keep youcovered when bending and stretching andso there they do give you a tip um I'musually a medium in Nike leggings and Iwas looking through reviews when Ipurchased this and even when I went intothe store and actually purchased it inperson I tried on a medium and it didfit really tight now these are scopetight pants so they're meant to you knowbe kind of like compression leggings sokeep that in mind I personally want asize up it's to a large in both thelegging and the Capri just because ityou know I didn't wanted to toocompressed but that's all personalpreference um and then the high timepants which are the Lululemon pants andI'm going to read you what the tag saysand it's pretty much they they are highrise 7/8 length pants were designed totake you from Hoffa to happy hour thereare a full on blue on fabric it's afour-way stretch wick sweat and givesincredible support and coverageit says added like I think it's inSpanish we say leak wrap but I'm notreally sure what I like wrong I'm notsure how it's pronounced in Englishfiber moves with you and stays in greatshapeit has a wide waistband that lies smoothagainst your skin and then it's - yourkey card and hidden side entry pocketand it has a hug sensation now theLululemon pants retail for $98 so theyare cheaper than the Nikes legendarysculpt tight pants so keep that in mindso now I'm going to pretty much gothrough the pros and cons and just mythoughts of both leggings and so thefirst one I'm going to talk to you guysabout is the Nike sculpt tight since Ihave had that one for over a year nowI've had the Capri and the pants and Idid purchase them I believe full pricethe Capri are only $100 or $10 you know$10 less and the pants are 110 they arevery I think in my opinion the materialand the way they fit is kind of feelslike I guess it's polyester but to me itkind of feels like a little like acotton II sort of thing I'm not sure itjust you know they fit they do fit goodI do like the pants but in comparison tothe Lululemon ones which I feel likejust hug you in the right places and sothat's one con of the sculpt pants andI'm not sure if it's because I'm youknow I sized up but I do feel like itdoesn't hug me as well as the Lululemonhigh-time pants I feel like theLululemon high-time pants hug me and youknow actually keep my you know because Ihave a little bit of us that can groupout a little tiny bit of stomach and itkind of hugs that all in the rightplaces and it keeps it does definitelyfit smoother now both of these pantsthey do not roll down too much which isyou know a huge issue for me is that Ifeel like sometimes high-rise pantswhether it's leggings or pantsyou know when you spend down squat downwhatever they tend to roll down and theydon't come back up and then you'realways like you know trying to pull themup and that's annoying especially whenyou're working out or even if you'redoing something like high-intensityplyometrics like burpees or just youknow jump squats or jump lunges and youdon't you know you don't want to stopmade workout just to fix your pantsthat's annoying um in that case I wouldsay that the Lululemon's did win in thataspect where they hug you a little bitbetter than the Nike sculpt tightanother thing is that I don't you knowthey say that this is a dry fit fabricwhich is you know I do believe I don'tfeel like you can see like sweat spotsor anything like that but I I feel likethe Lululemon win in that departmentjust because I feel like they they justyou know they hug you better but theyalso I feel like they wycked sweat morethan the Nike skull pants I feel likethe Nike School pants theythey pretty much absorb the sweat and Ifeel like it doesn't you know lets youbreathe or whatever but it absorbs thesweat but I feel like if I sat somewhereyou would see like a Prada like abuffering ring or something of sweat andso that's one thing to keep in mind isthat the Lululemon they just feel and Iguess that's the spandex part of it isthat they just feel like the sweat isbeing absorbed but it's also like goingout like it's it's not staying in theclothing if that makes sense and that'sone of the cons with these Nike skullpants where I feel like you know I'msweating or whatever and I feel like thepants are really absorbing a lot of thatso sweat which I think that's probablythe purpose of the dry fit but I feellike it's just holding on to it likesucking it up kind of like a sponge andI'm not sure that is the mostcomfortable way to feel when you'rewearing leggings after a while nursingso that's the second thing so the thirdthing is that the Lululemon pants areactually cheaper I mean not by a hugemargin but they are cheaper than theNike scope Nike sculpt type pants sothat's another thing to keep in mind isthat the Nike ones are actually a littlebit more expensive and I feel like theydon't really hug you the way theLululemon ones do I mean don't get mewrong I like the Nike sculpt tights I'vehad them for a very long time but Idon't feel I feel like the Lululemonones just fit better in terms of justkeeping your shape you know I feel likethis tight pants kind of suck you in alittle bit but like suck you in and kindof like all the wrong places um and I'mnot necessarily the wrong places butthey just make they kind of like are youknow they're compression so they kind oflike make your they don't give your butttoo much of a shape you know they youknow they do but then they don't it'syou know it's weird and so another thingand which is I guess my last point thatI want to address is that you know Ihaven't had the Lululemon pants for avery very long time not as long as myNiki sculpt tights but I've had them alittle long enough to determine what I'mabout to say now I had the Nike sculptpants and pretty much when I would putthem on and then after a few workouts Ithink probably after like one or twoworkouts the seams started to breakapart they started to get loose on theside I have a seam in like the I guessthe crotch area that is just loose andI've had to like cut and for 110 dollarsyou would think that they would sew thema little better but then again with howcompanies do things nowadays I'm likenot at all surprised you know Nikedoesn't really have the best trackrecord um you know historically for youknow just manufacturing their theiritems too well but the Lululemon ones Ijust feel like it's kind of I don't wantto say seamless but it doesn't you knowI just feel like it doesn't like I don'tfeel like there seems everywhere thatare going to fall apartand it's honestly as soon as I wore theNike sculpt pants I want to say maybelike a day or two afterwards the seamsstarted breaking apart and I've beenvery careful to not like pull on thembecause you know that I'm gonna have ahuge hole in my leggings and for theprice of these leggings you know youdon't you basically you know that's notthat's not good so overall I'm not goingto lie I think I do prefer the Lululemonhigh time pants better than the Nikesculpt another thing too is that theNike sculpt pants are you know prettymuch full length pants and so you youknow they go all the way down now thenthe Lululemon high tide pants are 7/8which is Lucas salad that I purchased sothey're cut just a tiny bit shorter andI don't know I kind of prefer it betterbecause it makes it you know kind offits your legs a little better overall Ibelieve you know and I still like Istill like these Nike school pants butoverall I think the Lululemon high-timepants pretty much have made you knowhave become my favorite leggings so farokay so in the Lululemon I am a size 6in this so you can see that that's proofsize 6 and it's kind of backwards butyou kind of get the idea I'm a size 6and the Lululemon and in the Nike sculpttype pants I am a large I could havebeen a medium but at the timeI purchased these pants you know I didyou know I didn't really fit too well inthe medium but these are in Lululemonsizes a size six which is the high timepant and this is Lulu's medium so six toeight is Lululemon's mediumI hope the review was helpful you knowI'm not bashing any companies you knowI'm not saying one is better than theother one this is just all personalpreference it's all my personal opinionI have a bunch of leggings from Nike andI love their leggings I love theirdesigns but overall I feel like lemonsquality just kind of beat theirhigh-rise pants in this one so in anycase guys

hello friends welcome back I am comingat you again with another LululemonYouTube video so this time it's gonna bekind of small haul that I did but alsoit's more than two items so fromLululemon I consider that to be a fulllong haul so I have you solved that mypast Lululemon collection video you'llknow that I was wearing a size 4 and Iwas having trouble with a lot of myshorts and bottoms I did decide to sizeup to a size 6 and the Lululemon bottomsand it's been great I decided to sell alot of my items as someone I alreadyknew so I got a little bit of money outof those and use some of that to getsome new items so here we are the firstitem that I did end up purchasing is myfavorite hottie hot short which I know Italked about a lot in my last video Igot them in black and a size 6 they arethe 4 inch inseam they fit so muchbetter I have so much more room in mylegs and my waist I don't feel tightaround the like crotch region from theliner inside so you know a little bitabout these they're pretty great shortsthey were might they are my favoriteLululemon short when I keep going backto the most they have a nice little logoon the back here and the only bad thingabout theses they don't really have muchof pockets so if you're wearing themaround out and about then you know everbigger put them what I mean like that'skind of given with a lot of shortsanyway so that is the first item they'reso great I'm so happy I sized up 206 andI was so excited to get those the nextitem that I did get is the super highrise as you all know I love Wonderunderpants in black in a size 6 I'mgoing to get these homes I haven't yetso they're so awesome this is the luxuryand fat bag so that super breathabletries easily and feels really nice onthe skin and I'm so happy I'm kind ofupset that I you know did have to getrid of my basically brand new ones andthat nice camo print but I'm sureanother print will come out next yearthat I can get so or later in the yearso those are so great and as you allknow I love the super high-rise becauseI do have a long torso so they just fitreally flattering on me and I love themso muchthe next pant that I did purchase arethe a-line jogger so at first I didn'twhen these first came out I wasn'treally interested in them because theway they looked on the model just tosaid hi one of them to fit on me butthen I saw someone else wearing them anddecided to go ahead and get them I didget these in a size four so I couldprobably get the six in these but a lotof people do size down on the aligns andmy other line pants still fit me welleven though I kind of had to size up onall the other fabrics so I went aheadwith the four like I said I couldprobably get a six of these but thesefit perfectly fine and I love the waythey look they have pockets on the frontand because of the pockets you will seethat's not a super high rise or anythingit's a regular rise but it's a regularhigh rise but it's really not that highbut it's not a big deal there was supercozy I love that I can wear these POWand a bow and feel put together withouthaving skin tight pants on they have theclassic a-line that contour on the backwith the lulu logo and a small pockethere as well yeah these are really greatin these are they 28 inch length I don'tthink the crop would look quite right onme I do have kind of long legs so it'sso buttery soft and so comfy I'm sohappy I decided to get them I've beencontemplating it for a while so they'rereally really great am I so you can seeI got a lot of items in black as I'mkind of redoing my wardrobe a little bitso the next item that I have is I thinkit's the baptistry tank I did end upgetting this in a size 6the 8 would've fit but it was kind ofloose and I wanted something a littlebit more supportive if I was going onabout so it does have these support brainside because it's white it is a littlebit see-through I don't really mind itbut I if I did get another oneyou know I'd want to get a darker colorthat's less cedar like the black ordersomething else but it's great just forlike lounging around the back is supersuper cute these teams have greatyou use so many people talk so greatabout them I'm happy I tried them out soif you're looking at a support tank Ireally like this that how I didn't quitefit me how I wanted it to its way tolike snuggle area as well but this wasreally great so I'm so excited to havethis moving forward um the next itemthat I got I forget the name but I'llput it up Lulu just released their firstdouble t /e sized bra you guys that'slike a regular sports bra so this is socute I feel like its a mix between theenergy and the free to be serene plusmore room for girls like me and it's soexciting we've been waiting so long forthisI've been purchasing a lot of theathletic force bras because they alwaysoffered like small medium large and ddouble D and so I've been fine withthose for the longest time but thisfeels so nice it has great coverage andit is medium support but I'll still wearit for just about any workout be backI'm sorry I'm probably gonna end upgoing back and getting the other colorsas well because I think this is gonna besomething that does eventually sell outso I'm hopefully LuAnn will keep makingthese products I mean we've been waitingso long there's so many cute bras thatjust don't fit girls that have a biggerbus so it's so excitingyep and I got it in the white and ofcourse it has a little ooh look out andthese shops on the back our like a goodmix between the energy in the 3d screenit's so exciting it's so exciting I meanit's been a long time coming so the nextitem I have I purchased this in a size 6and 8 and I ended up returning the 6 soluckily oh and sorry also this pointspart is a size 8 at first I purchasedthe 6 but I had an opportunity for the 8because I was nervous that the 8 BAMsize would be too big but they actuallymade it nice and snug so it kind ofallows you to go up if you need to whilestill having the support so the bandspice was perfectly fine on me and thatwas so exciting so I did get the size 8in that as well as on this swim top Igot the size 8this one obviously does a very thin bandso it's not gonna be like super supersupportive and also I probably wouldn'twear this in front of like grandparentsor anything like that but if you thisisn't necessarily made for like justlarge bust so if you are like a B or Cer and hey or whatever this is going tolook so flattering on you to the fronthas like this where it overlapsand it's a rib material so fun and Ilove the white it's lined with a tancolor and so when you first pull it outit actually looks like it's super dingybut when you're wearing it it lookssuper bright so it just helps kind ofkeep it from being see-through which isI mean awesome so yes you have thisreally flattering cut in the front Ilove it because I feel like it looksgrown-up in elegant while also being ispretty in trendy and then on the back wehave the Lululemon logo here and thisnice like you back and I really likethat look especially this summer like Ijust been loving that rather than yourtypical you know Chris drops and ties sothe I love the clip on this thing it'sjust push this out and then you justpull it under so to go in it's supereasy to put on it but it's also secureit's so secure too so it's so awesomeand it's so flattering I actually it's akind of a funny story but I was out atthe pool with my boyfriend the other dayat our apartment and I was wearing thisand shortly after it was like the nextday I went to the local Linda lemon toreturn but the size six talked becauseit was too small and the girl there waslike oh my gosh I have been looking atthe top online and I didn't know if Iwanted to get it but I saw some girl atthe pool at my apartment and she lookedso good and then I was like girl wheredo you live and it was me and I was likethat is so funny what a small worldbut I was like thank goodness I didn'tlook bad in it it would find so it looksreally really cute and flattering on Ijust love it so much so of course Icaught the matching bottoms and a size 6and this is the clear waters top andbottom you need again unlikelaughs it's so cute and has the tanlining inside as well they also offerthese in a high-rise and it's reallyreally cuteI haven't ever purchased a high-risebottom just because I don't know why Icare so much about two hand linesbecause for the majority of the time Ido wear a regular rise so if I if I geta high-rise I probably would wear itmore like nighttime and you know theevening swims and stuff but these justhave a really flattering look I thinkthey have good coverage I like that youknow you have this big band that'saround the only problem I ever have withyou swim suit bottoms is that sometimesthe elastic on the top flips when itgets wet but it's never anything superbad that you can't just quickly fix soit's a ripped material you have he kindaLululemon logo on the back and Iactually knew that I was going to getthese in a size 6 because like in theearly early spring well probably wasn'teven spring yet I don't know I saw thatthey had this bottom from last year onsale and a few other colors and Iactually ordered a green in a size 4 andI loved it I'm a big fan of green so Iloved the green one but an ordinate sizefor her because my normal size and itwas way too tight on me should have beenmy first hint and so I returned it butthey were out of that color in the sinksand it was on sale so I went ahead andgot I forget what's when I got firstactually but I ended up getting thischambray chambray guys that I said thisblue color and it's almost like a grayso it's super cute fits on a bunch ofbits with a bunch of different colors soyeah this is a size 6 and it's the sameexact Clearwater's bottom so it's ribbedas well and I think they still have thiscolor online in a size 6 it's this redcolor and super cute not just so manythings and it's I like these colorsbecause they kind of pop a little bitbut they also look really puts the otherand you know can be seen asbe a little order and stuff like that soI have the red and then I also have thisreally cute like blush paint color and Ilove them because there's such goodmaterial they're nice and thick and likethey're all double layers youI love how Lululemon put the tan liningand a bunch of them so that it reallystops it from being seen through andthese all look so good with like a whitetop or a black top so it's it's so greatthey don't go togetherso those are all the items I got I knowit's like a huge haul this has been overthe past like couple months and it's nota huge haul but it's a good amount ofitems I know this stuff isn't cheap soit's a big deal but I was so excitedthat I was able to get some money fromthe end of that don't fit me anymore andit was sad to see like having to sellthem for so much less than they wereworth because some of them were likereally new and some of them were inreally good shape as well I just keep mystuff and really nice shape I take careof it and then having to sell it forlike not even half the value but I'mhappy because someone else is getting toenjoy them and you know I was able tokind of put that money towards a coupleof new items so so excited let me knowwhat you guys think of these items I'malso going to post an a short Athletahaul that I have done recently here soonI'll probably post that one within thenext few days or so and I've beenthinking about like maybe doing aswimsuit haul review just so the stuff Ibought this summer and maybe like one ortwo that I loved last summer but I knowit's already like getting into July andI don't know if that's something thatyou guys would want to see so let meknow I can tell that the Lululemonvideos are

[Music]give me the chills[Music]hello friends welcome back to my channeltoday we're gonna do a quick littleclothing haul I picked up a few thingsfrom a ritzy ax and never lying butthey're all big items I also picked acouple of things from Lululemon as wellso I would share with you some of thenew things that I picked up within thelast couple weeks a couple fun ways tostyle each item and before we go and getstarted first make sure you hit thesubscribe button if you haven't alreadyand little notification bell withoutfurther ado let's go ahead and getstarted okay so this is the first thingthat I picked up in is actually along-sleeve turtleneck high neck topfrom LululemonI feel like these types of tops you canoutfit so many different ways they're sogood for layering this was actually onsale from Lululemon I got it for 50doulas originally was 88 material issuper nice and soft I also love that ithas the little sleeve ease it's nice tohave something like that because then Idon't have to worry about the sleevegetting stuck and having to pull it outyou don't mean just a small detail andthen the back of the sweater also hassome like really cool stitching so Ijust feel like it's a very expensivelooking piece that was on sale soobviously I had to have it I'll send itwith these pants from outdoor voicesthat I've got a while ago I'm obsessedwith these pants are actually like cargopants after horses is more of a likeathleisure brand so these are actuallymeant to be worn like outside but Ibought them because of fashion I havethem in a size medium and I love the waythat they look there's actually littlezips so you can change them into shortscapris and long pants and I thought itwould be cool if I paired it with thissuper puff this is also one of the newerthings that I picked up recently and Ihave been wanting a Super puff for solong but this is the super long superpup from Orencia I am obsessed it is sowarm and cozy and one of my favoritethings about this is it has an innerlayer sleeve that feels exactly like theLululemon Alliance like it is just sosoft and comfortable and every time I goout and try other puffy coats I was justconstantly comparing it to the Superpuff just because I feel like these havesuch a good shape they feel really niceanda good weight and they come in so manygreat colors as well and I feel like theprice point is totally affordable thisis the finished outfit that I had inmind and I threw it on my Nike Air ForceOnes I've side these in so many lookbooks they're just like a really goodtrekking shoe I have a little whitebeanie that's actually Brandon with thisoutfit I look you feel like I'm readyfor the slopes or to go skiing I thinkif you live somewhere super cold I'mgoing to New York and March are I'msuper excited I definitely can seemyself wearing an outfit like thisbecause this Co is just so warm and cozyand I like how long and thick it is andit just gives me like a cool girl vibesyou knowokay this is another piece I picked outfrom Lululemon I don't want to spend toomuch time on it just because it is likeone of their basic long sleeve tops Ilove these for working out and also forlayeringespecially if I'm going somewhere whereit's super cold I feel like it's a goodthermal layer but they launched thisreally cool neon color on camera itlooks more yellow but in person it'slike a neon yellow green I think theseare worth the money because I have twoof them that I wear all the time it'ssweat wicking it's breathable and theyjust look so cool and expensive this isanother piece I picked up these areactually little booties from every LaneI was gifted to things from every laneone of them was a brown wool coat thatis amazing that I'll show you guys in asecond but another thing that I pickedout are these booties and they arecalled the boss booties I love these Ifeel like the shape of them are so coolI like that these are kind of amid-shaft they're not super super highbut it's a great length because it willgo with a lot of things also like a goodheel so I feel like these would be supersuper comfortable they're true to sizeso I got them in six and a half justlooks super high quality and the bootitself is just so beautiful this outfitI think is super just cool and casualand I imagine myself walking around thecity if it's really really cold and youstill want to look a little bit moreprofessional maybe I would swap out theheady for like a sweater but I do havethese Levi's 501 skinnies and the bossboots I was showing you guys earlier Ijust think this is such a cool laid-backoutfit you don't look like you're tryingtoo hard but you still look very puttogether okay next thing I picked up wasthis blouse from ERISA I am obsessed Ithink it is so pretty so chic andelegant looking and it's actually thissilk blouse from Wilfred this color soldout so quickly and it is such a prettybrown tone color my favorite thing aboutthis is this blouse material it makes itso easy to dress up or dress down youcan throw it over like a black tighterdress if you wanted anight outlook and here is a more officewhere type of outfit I just have a nerdblack pants on if you have any type ofone of these pants called and then stylethrough the shoes I have these littleslip-on flats from Zara that I got awhile ago I think these are just supersimple and the pointy heel kind of justmakes the outfit look a little bithigher level and not so casual over topI have a new coat that I also wanted toshare with you all this is the coat thatI got from every Lane this is theirItalian ReWalk coat and shut it off onmy Instagram stories the other day and Igot so many DMS it's around $300 andeverything's website but I feel like itis such a striking piece that makes melook so expensive it just makes you looklike you have a lot of money a lot ofresources if you know what I mean so Ijust let this coat the color of it islike my favorite part about it and it isdouble-breasted so if you wanted to wearit like this you totally can so if I'mgoing somewhere super super cold I mightwear a couple layers and a hoodieunderneath feel like with such astructured coat over top makes theoutfit look really structuredsophisticated definitely officeappropriate anyways this tote is aboutthree hundred dollars and everybody'swebsite and they did gift it to me Ithink $300 for a wool coat is such agood price and it is such a beautifulshape I do have an aside zero I wouldthink on a size two but it ended upbeing too wide in the shoulder so thezero does fit me perfectly the arms arereally greatly okay I wanted to show youall quickly a more casual way that youcan wear this if you didn't want to wearto the office manner with the sameLevi's 501 skinnies I showed you allearlier and my little ever layingbooties the more where these two morelike okay these are super cute it's atthe perfect heel length and I couldtotally see myself wearing it to theoffice walking around the city they'rejust such a comfortable boot wentsomething like this since we are using alot more darker tones I definitely wouldwear a like darker overcoat so pairedwith this outfit I have this black coatfrom RIT SIA that you've seen a ton oftimes it's from BAP time I feel likethis coat kind of just ties everythingtogether but again this is a greatexample of how you can style the blouseany more casualtone down way next piece that I got fromher Vidya was this sweater I am soobsessed with this I've seen so manygirls style it so many different ways onInstagram on a rich dudes website and Ijust love the look of cardigan worn as asweater this one here is from I believeWilfred or Babbitt on my favorite partis the color I feel like this goes withso many things that layers really nicelyand especially under like a coat itlooks so much more sophisticated thanjust like a plain sweater so I love thisI can also see myself wearing it openand like the spring or summer over adress or something like that it just hasa really good shape and I love that it'scropped because it's so versatile I'mpairing it with these blue jeans from aGoldy these are like one of my top orangjeans ever the high-waisted jeans justreally complement my figure and alsoplays with the proportions of thesweater really really nicely over top Ithought it would be so cute to layerthis every Lane coat we're just reallymaking use of all the brown tones I feellike it looks so sophisticated andstriking and I love matching tongue Ijust feel like it makes you look so muchmore expensive and stylish so I do havethese jeans cuffed a little bit becauseI did want to pair them with thesebooties these booties are from Zara Igot them a while ago but I've styledthem so many different ways you probablyhave seen them all over my Instagramokay so I love the way that this outfitlooks it just makes me look so let's getit and high-end this ever link oh I'mtelling you goes with so many differentthings and I just love how structuredand long it is I love all the browntones together and with those our shoesit's just a lot of really good tonesplaying with each otherokay now I have a little bit more of acasual outfit that I wanted to show youguys this is the same sweater and Ipaired it with these leather pants fromER it's yeah but these are really coolbecause they're kind of high-waisted butit's a straight legged pant the leatherjust makes the outfit look a little bitmore interesting rather than just beinglike so much black I paired with itthese white common projects that I raveabout I used to wear them so much but Iobviously was wearing my coils a lot doreally love how these shoes look withthis outfit it just keeps it lookingvery high-end and designer and then overtop

"now I'd like to welcome a friend an fwechampion she flew to Prince George evenin British Columbia last fall for theone-day E Series there and changed manypeople's lives former VP of Starbuckswho helped grow the company withStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz from 1986onwards then CEO at Lululemon grew sales350 percent in five years transformedthe business into the world's mostprofitable retail apparel company andthen you'd think she'd be done but noshe did what all smart people do shebecame an entrepreneur and now she'sturning the frozen food industry on itshead being the CEO of Louvre oh anddistributing in 6,000 retailers in theUS including on tell two flights she's amother she's an innovator she's a friendof fwe please welcome Christine dayThank You Kristina it's a pleasure to behere and and join you join you once moreand Prince George was lovely by the wayI'd never been there before and thatshows you how the power persuasion thatChristina when she asked you to dosomething you find yourself on littleplanes or you know I have to head backtonight even just getting here late lastnight because it meant so much to me tohelp Christina with this amazing programthat she has started that I think reallymakes a difference and it's worth everymoment that I've put into being heretoday and I hope you'll feel that wayafter my talk what I want to speak toyou today about I mean there's so manythings that I'm gonna try and cram like30 years of experience into 15 minutesthat I'd like to talk about but I thinkyou know I've had an opportunity toparticipate in some great companies youknow Starbucks the the story there was Iactually started with Howard and ildrenOllie and my first job was to help himraise the money to grow the company andtook on an operating role at the sametime and there was one store and revenuewas about 400,000 for the whole year andwhen I left it was a 7 billion companyand I was running ten countries in Asiaso it was an incredible twoErnie and I learned so many things therethen I took a year off because I havethree children I want to spend a littletime at home and then I started atLululemon and that was about just undertwo hundred million and was one pointsix billion when I left after six yearsso I've learned a lot about growth butI've also learned a lot about marketdisruption and so you know one of thequestions I get asked a lot is did youjust get lucky or did you see somethingand so what the first thing I want totalk a little bit about is isrecognizing good ideas and and what isit that I see in the marketplace and howhave these companies come together to beso powerful in the marketplace andbefore I go there I want to talk alittle bit about what we're doing atLouvre oh so my personal experience ismy mother suffered from diabetes due toan illness that she had in her early 50sfor a little over 20 years and sherecently lost her lower left leg due todiabetes complications and has kidneyissues so I had to help my dad find foodfor my mom to cook for her becausethey're by themselves and my dad was nowtaking on a lot more of the cooking butI also had to be really sensitive towhat my mom could eat and the realitywas I couldn't find much and my dad'snot much of a cook unless it's on abarbecue so you know finding healthymeals I realized as I was walkingthrough the grocery stores you know theorganic is not enough because it'sactually very poor nutrition in a lot ofcases and has high sodium has high sugarrates which is you know really bad verylow in protein the right not the rightcombination of foods if you're anutritionist so I happened across asmall food company that had a greatpurpose but was very much struggling inand not probably going to make it and itwas probably a lot worse shape than Ithought when I took it on so I took onthat small company and changed the focusof every meal we did to perfectnutrition and affordable and so Irecognized standing in the grocery storethat there were about 200 items thatcould be redeveloped to a healthyprofile based off of nutrition and be 70to 80% organicand have antibiotic and hormone-freebeef and that could be affordable andnot served in plastic trays becauseeverything we do is served in a paperpouch so you know it was it's a steammethod of cooking which also can be putin the oven so you don't have tomicrowave it so that was disruptive onone level but that wasn't enough for meto keep it interesting so I wanted tochange the whole way foods brought tomarket so we've partnered up with somesubstantial farms in the US and we'restill completing some additional dealswhich will ultimately bring us intoCanada but what we've done is we'vemoved dehydrators out to farms becausein the farming community only about 50%of the produce actually makes the marketin fact MacLaine's just spoke about thisin an article this monththat's just recently out about theamount of food waste at farms and it'stoo expensive to ship it so what we dois we dehydrate it there into flakes orsemi dehydrate pieces now that saveswater it saves energy it reduces thecost and it brings the most nutritiousactually food to the marketplace and themost flavorful and then we take thosecrystals or semi dehydrate pieces andmake the sauces and the ingredientswhich make our product more flavorful orreduce the sodium levels and and reallypreserves the whole economic cycle ofsustainability and then we're just nowtaking the pressed juice pulp remainsfrom juice companies which is all thefruit and vegetables as well and makingthat in so it's reclaiming food and thecycle to make food more abundant and atthe same time and then food can beaffordable but it's all organic foodwhich everybody is seeking and chasingso disrupting the whole cycle is whatwe're up to while we're manufacturinggreat tasting food so we're currently inabout 5,000 grocery stores in the US andwe just launched in Vancouver this lastweek and we'll probably be in theToronto market by July so that's whatwe're up to at Louvre oh so and when Istarted there thiswere you know just under a milliondollars I think for the product andpeople said no why did you start and youknow in something that small you couldhave done anything and my response wasthe growth is all ahead of me so ifyou're somebody who loves to growbusinesses small doesn't scare youbecause you see the future that's allthe way in front so what is it I'velearned about building these greatcompanies and and seeing the first isthat your company has to have greatpurpose so people don't come to work foryou as a job they actually come to workfor the mission of your company and whenyou get them to work for the mission ofyour company then they believe and workdoesn't feel like work they get upcoming in every day to be a part of thejourney and to make a difference in whatit is that you're up to and that's acommon thread about Starbucks which wasyou know creating the third place andsustainability in the coffee farms andbeing really clear and articulate in thepurpose and values of your company iswhat engages your workforce it attractspeople who are there for the mission ofyour company not just to have a job orbe there based on pay so if you're gonnaattract great people and have a storythat changes the social narrative you'vegot to have a great purpose and be withgreat values and that's a common threadso what I'm always looking for is what'sthe purpose what what is it that I cancreate that's different than what's herebefore what's needed in a way thatdeclares a powerful purpose that notonly my employees but my consumers areengaged with the second is you needgreat differentiation so when you lookat Starbucks you know at the time youknow coffee was commoditized and it wasyou know 50 cents a cup and and peoplehad forgotten what good coffee was socreating great coffee and bringing it tothe third place and having a place wherepeople could gather together again as asense of community brought social valuesand the consistency and quality and thecustomization that Starbucks brought wasalso great differentiation so what wasdifferent from getting just a black cupof coffee was customization so getting adouble tall extra hot how sweet no wetmocha anytime you wanted it anywhere youwanted ithad high value and so that ability tocreate something that's trulydifferentiated and unique in themarketplace and at Lululemon whathappened was we brought the mindset ofyoga to the athletic world but we alsothe purpose was also to help build moreyoga studios and our work withambassadors creating more yoga forpeople to go to created more market sowe weren't selling product we weremaking a market with the work that wedid with our ambassadors and trustingthat we knew our job well enough but tocreate bringing fashion into athleticclothes you know women did not want toin their 30s look like they're wearingtheir soccer uniform to the coffee shopand then bringing the retail experienceso no longer shopping at Dick's SportingGoods or Sports Authority or you knowthe the local sporting chain where theyhave no dressing fit rooms and if theydid have them they were filled withshoes and if you didn't have the brasize you wanted you had to ask the guywho was taking care of shoes to go getyou another one and he'd look at youwith that blank expression so bringingthe retail shopping experience toathletic wear and bringing that yogamindset which was a purpose peoplewanted to believe in and actually designclothes into what women did instead ofsoccer football which I recognize somepeople do do those things or rugby orhockey most of us go to the gym so weactually designed for what the marketwas so those differentiation points andat Leveaux recognizing that nutrition isthe unsaid conversation that's mostneeded in the marketplace so we're noteating empty calories thatdifferentiation and understanding how tocreate a story around that in themarketplace that you're first in iscritical to building a great businessthe next thing that I look at is greatknowledge so you know I am an ideaperson and a strategist but I alsobelieve in knowing the field that you'replaying in and examples I give is I youknow of my of my boys one is a carfanatic he knows everything there isaround cars so when we go to buy a car Ibring him with me and it'sreally funny to watch the salesperson inthe end of the beginning of theconversation they're talking to me inabout five minutes later they're talkingto my at the time twelve-year-old who'snegotiating for my Lexus so because heknew cars and and it's his passion andhe's really good at it my older son isyou know all about sports he's a walkingyou know ESPN and so he knows sports sowell at eight he won the sports triviacontest on a cruise in the bar you knowthat's like who he is he's talkingsports and if you know your businesswith that level of passion you know thenyou know the playing field you know whoyour competition is and it's just likebreathing to you because you know youhave that great knowledge of theindustry you're in reading about itworking in it you know it's connected tothat passion but you have to know theplaying field and you have to know whoyour competition is and you have to beinterested in that so think of it alwaysas knowing your ESPN facts do you knowthat about your business great ideasoften fail and Christina and I think inyour your talk talked about like 50percent of entrepreneurial adventuresdon't make it you have to be able toscale with impact in your business andthat takes great discipline which is theother thing I've really learned to do soI know what metrics matter in mybusiness both strategically andoperationally and I make sure that whenI do my planning that I'm planning notonly for what has to happen today butwhat has to happen for the future I callthis the to bridge analogy so there's alot of congestion on the bridge I havetoday but if I only fix that instead ofbuilding my bridge for the future Iwouldn't be able to live my purpose forthe organization so I'm always planningon two horizons for the businesses thatI'm in so I'm managing for the long termand the short term issues that we've gotand I know what metrics matter and wetalk about them weekly so great team Ithink you guys all know about thatbut I want to share a few lessons aboutwhat I've learned about being a leadersince we're gonna run out of time sothere's some of the other things like Italked about but another one thing I'velearned about being a leader is youalready are one and you probably justdon'tpress it in all the ways that you couldand that each of us has uniqueleadership characteristics andeverything that's happened in our liveshas shaped us to be that leader that weare today all the good times all the badtimes actually create your leadershipplatform and you can't be somebodyelse's you can only be your own so it'sthat ability to look inside yourself anddefine leadership so for me I defineleadership in two ways one is creating afuture that would not otherwise occurand if you think about all the companiesthat I've worked for that are vision andpurpose led I'm about creating a futurelike food you know redefining the foodsupply chain and reinventing CPGcompanies that's a future that would nototherwise occur and then the othersecond part is creating the space forothers to perform so if you create thespace for others to perform you're notdoing everything yourself it's abouthaving that great team it's aboutcoaching it's about setting clearobjectivesit's about resource management it'sabout taking risks and choosing therisks you're gonna manage because I'llassure you at the top there are notperfect solutions those got made fartherdown your organization than I ever gotto you so the other thing that's reallyimportant is knowing yourself andknowing your journey and story as aleader and what is it that you bring inyour strengths and the second is knowingimpact that you have on other peoplelike I have a very definite style I'm ateam player I like to run a team as anorganization so I'm not a very I amdirective and the outcomes I want from astrategic perspective but I'm not goingto be as hands-on so I need players wholike to play in their own space and bepart of a team so knowing how I work andthe impact of my style on other peopleis part of what helps buildhigh-performance teams you know we'vetalked a little bit about passion andwe've talked about you know beingyourself a little bit and the one thingthat I've learned in my whole life fromthe time I was a very little girl isthat I've always been different and I'vebeen really happy to be different andthat's probably what's made me the mostdifferent is I haven't felt this need toconform or to bepeople expect me to be and from a veryearly age you know my mother would tellyou that was very very true and thebeautiful thing my parents gave me wasto not live a life of comparison or Igot to live a life of being me and Iknow that gave me the confidence in myin my future to express myself and mycapabilities in a way that didn't put mein a box and that mattered and that isthe hugest gift that you can givesomeone whether it's your child or astudent or colleague at work it's givingthem that room to be all of theirstrengths forgive them the things thatthey're probably not as good at and findways to bring teams together that arecompatible because you can't be otherpeople you know I think Oscar Wilde saidit best when he said be yourselfeveryone else is taken and you know I'vebeen learning to lead from this placeinside yourself is critical the otherthings are like you know hard work as atalent too when people say to me what isyour greatest talent I would probablytell you it's I work hard and I workhard at relationships as much as I workat my work so I tell people you knowwhen it worked for meyou know problems are what we come toresolve every day opportunities what wecome to pursue and relationships whatallows us to do both against the purposeof the organization so you have tomanage all of those dimensions as aleader and being bold is also reallyimportant it's the thing I found youknow if you're not bold then you'll bestanding around the water cooler talkingabout the person who is and I'd ratherbe the person who took that chance andthat opportunity then be the one whostood idly by and then the other thingis being your own disrupter you knowwhen I've already shared the stories inthe beginning about how I look atmarkets I'm not afraid to operate in thespace as a leader that's not analyzedand known so the thing about doingsomething different is it's never beendone before and therefore cannot bemeasured you have to move into yourstrategy and be confident of theinnovation in the site you see it anduse your skills to build the scalebehind it you can't measurewhat doesn't exist yet you can only saywhat would it take to win so I know I'vewon in this nutrition I think if I cancreate 200 SKUs that have beenreinvented accepted by the consumer andthen I'll have a billion-dollar companyso I can't look at analytical and salesof what doesn't exist I have to create agoal for the future to say this is whatthat market opportunity looks like andit's the last couple piece of advice isthe other piece is about yourself as aperson and I find it's farmer as aleader being humble is so important andthe difference is that we'reaccomplished but we're not any moreimportant than anyone else and so youcan be proud of your accomplishments butthey are not who you arethey are only what you've done so to bea real leader to people you have to seethe people that you're working with andthat are working for you and you have tocreate the same type of environment forthem that you'd want for yourself andyou know at the end of it sometimes youhave to call your own game because notyou can't be the leader that you want tobe everywhere and you have to know whenit's your time and I recognize that atStarbucks and I recognize that atLululemon and you know so sometimes youthe power of choice is also the biggestpower you have as a leader and leadingyour own personal journey and staying inyour values so those are the things thatthat I've really learned over my 30years and there's so much more I couldtell you but I think we have generoustime for question and answers orconversations so if there's anythingthat you'd like to talk about I'm reallyopen to that but I just want to thankChristina for giving me the opportunityto share a little bit about marketdisruption and the leadership journeythat I've had thank you",22,UCCsZspMxh8n7RKcBOx3mA-A,The Forum,1,1,0,15,"['FWE', 'toronto', 'christine day', 'women', 'Entrepreneur (Profession)']","Market Disruption -

theother material about CEUs for cardiookay I don't know about the purple somuch you have to wonder on now feel goodthey're like nice and thick and thissounds like more of the cottony feel andthey do so good did you feel what's thedifference between this under crop andrezoning I guess that one does thisstyle is a different solution same thecompression is oh I see but definitelynot the dance studio Zumba pain I'm notopposed to GZ there but these not fortravelingthey can figure out what size you whatsize of a mannequin those are six okayroll downtrying these on in the charcoal colorburst they do have a nice seam and youguys were right out of hi Keeks isunclear about these and you said theband is kind of what makes them specialand yeah they do eggs like crazy fan allright so now I'm going to try it on theblack ones and see how those compareokay Mitel see you're helping me decidebetween the charcoal colored ones andthe black ones they both feel good thecircle wins felt more like yeah theyfeel it just kind of softer more caughtme I guess black or a dark gray is thisthe same style what's their front whereis it wonder underpant roll downoh why right hey right okay as I triedout a few different periods I think I'mgonna get the black and the six sohopeful with these I tried on these twocharcoal are really cute they're themore cotton ehindbut I think if I'm only gonna get oneperiod evidence you eat the black onesdon't wash them with cotton and don'tuse fabric softener and wash them incold water I'm glad you told me aboutthe cotton thing yeah what darks it isso humid oh my goodness is like supercalm and humid it's like the calm beforethe stormand I got the card in the mail rightjust like there's nothing I want or needa couple of makeup to try out so I'mtotally into trying like makeupmy last favorite pair of yoga pants thatI had were from Victoria's Secret and wewere in New Zealand and they got tornmy idea so I get into five new throwthose out so bummed that I havepurchased a pair since then and so thisis the first pair that I finally likewent after and I've really needed himbecause we'd be going to Arizona so Idon't have any like warm clothes so I'mtrying to like run around and find likesome warm layers are you hungry we haveseen before you where's your babiesthough she's got to lose their littlewatering hole here did my babies you gotyour two chicks there looking goodyou're looking healthy nice and glossyand plump yeah maybe they areit's pouring rain this morning andthat's authority to look for a NorthFace I'm hoping that they have my sizebecause I looked at it online and I justwant to see it in personI'll get it here if it's the same pricesonline bad enough for this do have myBeastie Boys hat on todayhiding from the rain nice thing is theglacier top exactly like before but itis like you see I'll come back to thatjackets no although this is whitejackets oh no no that's a green beansweatshirtshere's Columbia I was looking atColumbia but I think I want to go withNorth Face I don't know let's seeglacial three from Columbia I feelinglike really ill-prepared for this winterfor some reason I just I have like nowarm clothes at all so I'm just kind oflike right now I'm in like a built inold navy shirt and it's not even warmenough for out here so alright I'm goingto try this one on which this is a nicefluffy one this is the most detail sothat's right oh this is so freaking softbecause the oh my gosh I love this itcomes to different colors it has likeway more colors available online theyonly have like a couple colors here so Idon't know so if I didn't go with thewhite then I'd have to order online if Ihit this but I love how thick and fluffythe colors is so soft and then the backin suits down a little bit more alrighthere's the second one this one I cantell right away is too shorts but if itwas a little bit longer it would beperfect cuz I really like how soft it isand it's a little more fitted to thearms it kind of like like they're likethe length of those sleeves andeverything and I like how it's it's alittle bit thinner so it sort of fits toyour body better but yeah two minutestoo short but this one is like supervelour soft inside so that would be areally nice one for someone this onethat is the same one just a differentsize so I guess I'll try that one on andsee if it's any different in length sothat was the small and not the supermedium and so basically here is thedifference of the medium it's just alittle wider the links didn't reallychange all that much so the arms get alittle bit a little bit wider a littlebit looser yeah Michaels outside hereshould I try and some shorts like thistry on some tights and then I can wearlittle tanks together look so I do theglacier please from our face so here'swhat it looks like and it does have anicer length on it it's a little bitwide though I wish it would put a littlea little more snug but that's okaybecause if you're if you're wearing likelong-sleeved shirts and stuff under ityou know the layers don't build up underthere a little bit I like the length ofthe sleeves so this is also a little bitless I think this is like that but it isway more lightweight for please comparedto like the other ones that you sprayedon here's the medium of the first onethat I tried on and I like the link itseems to fit good the first time I triedon was a small I think you're probablygonna end up seeing is one of these ifit's not sure what color yet and theback has a nice link you I just grabbedthe Benton Springs from Columbia whichis like one of their most popularbest-selling releases and here it issemi compare between the Columbia andthe best-selling from your face sohere's the Columbia Benton Springs andthis is in the cream or ivory color waitlet me see oh yesit's like many different things a littlebit bulkier just you know I guess youget bit more leaders inside so it's justnot as big but it's still supercomfortable the police is just morelightweight compared to like that'ssuper thick and like a high pile andthis is just a little like dinner morelike micro fleece kind of feeling thelength is nice so I like that it has alonger length there's a big differencein price up to this one read it this oneis only $35 whereas the North Face oneis what I heard yeah big difference inprice being that the north face is threetimes as much as the business rings fromColumbia but you have to go with the oneyou love because I'm shopping for thefleece not uh please don't we goquality over quantity rightwhich one did you like better Idefinitely like the North Face I'm intown after go feed the water be littleanimalhow'd that golike I've ever hadI feel and the fifth that I love becauseyou're they're super comfortable nicecushy

have to have that done sothe tracking is the main thing that I'vehad to pay attention to and the trackingis like how the aligners are how thetrays are fitting it onto your teeth Ihave to fit all the way on there becauseif there's a little gap right at the youknow right at the bottom like in betweenyour toes like there's a little bit ofair gap then they're not trackingproperly so I'm always like

I am so excited to share these with youguys because not only are they cheap butthey're also from Amazon just one myfavorite places to shopso get ready what is up guys and welcomeback to my channel and I'm back at youwith another legging video and not justleggings but Amazon leggings which aresome of my favorite leggings justbecause they're so easy to order they'reso cheap all these I'm reviewing threetoday they're all in the range of like$18 $25 and they're meant to be dupes ofthe Lululemon aline leggings which I'msure you've seen him but they're thoselike high waisted leggings like no bandat the top basically like super superflattering so we're gonna test all theseout today and see how they compareso the first leggings are these cr-zyoga leggings and they're described aslike a naked feeling and the first thingI want to say is that fabric so theseare a slicker material but they don'tfeel like a compression they're verylightweight so I feel like these aregoing to be the closest ones even thoughthey don't have that like like you knowbrushed feeling but they do have a verysimple logo it's they look like bluelogo and if you can see the fabric isslightly shiny but it's also super thinso these are $24.99 with prime of courseand they come in a bunch of four colorsbut they're mostly like dark colors soColerain just slightly less than wewould want and there's 71% polyamide and29 percent spandex I don't know is thatcr-z yoga they have a size extra extrasmall just like a double 0 toextra-large so that's the largest rangeI've seen on these super leggings soto be inclusive I also got a size smalland all these leggings just becausethat's what I normally am and wheneversomeone tells me they like run small andI get a medium they end up looking todayso I'm very small all of the leggingstoday don't have that top band sothey're very stretchy at the top andaren't gonna like cut into your waistwhich can sometimes be unflatteringthese also have a double band so it'snot the same quite the same as a littleof it they also have the extended guestcrotch so let's try these on and seeanything so these are the cr-z yogaleggings and I just have to say justlike putting these on it felt so nicethey're like very thin and like conformto your body yeah if you like these evenmore than 1200 leggings which you guysknow I love but as you can see thematerial it's just not it's notgathering in any unusual spacescameltoe I mean I don't really thinkthere is any it's just so smooth it'svery thin so you can kind of see theoutline of the pocket that you can inthe Lululemon as well and I just thinkthese are such a nice like slickmaterial without being compression umthen squat groove that looks prettysquat proof to me so we can say squatproof so very thin material but notsheer even also they're about a 7/8length on me I am tall and you can seethe extended gusset crotch the logofalls on a next place the seams fallabout right above the butt and again itis that double seam so I would get theselike I would get these like an 8 out of10 I'm really liking them actually youknow maybe even more I really don't haveany complaints about these I just I lovewhen leggings just conform to your bodyand just feel like you're not wearinganythingand these literally feel like that so Iwould say these are almost a perfectdupe for the lines except for thematerial is slick instead of that likerush feeling but they're conforming tomy body in just the same ways and thewaste balls are just right above mybelly button again no seam so yeah I amreally loving these the next pair arethe low pass yoga leggings um they aredescribed as tummy control high waistedthey also have the same little pocketthat the lines have sounds like an innerwaistband pocket again no top seam andthese have a very similar single seamlike the little lemon lines and againthe gusset crotch but this material kindof feels like the classic like Lululemonwonder under material so and it'sdefinitely a lot like thicker andsturdier so these are definitely aheavier pair of leggings then the likethis your z gopis the material I feellike is not quite what you want if youare looking for an exactalign to I'm just because these do feela little thicker but yeah anyway theseare 2299 with Prime and they come inthis color they come in a little reddishpink of midnight blue and I look kind oflike a dark lilacso good color range and these are nylonspandex materials the low hatha-yoga hasa size extra small to extra large theseare also 7 8wait so you know that good for shorterpeople or I'm tall and I kind of likethe side things like so call mepersonally one drawback of all theseliking videos I just get really hot I'mtrying them all on but anyways I'mwearing too low ha Co go right now andI'm liking with a lot more than Ithoughtthe material is definitely thicker thanthe last one and it's that like cottonII know shine material there's no cottonin it but I just feel it more cottony tome um camel toe let's see not really Idon't really find an issue since thesearen't seamless they don't even get alot of camel toe [ __ ] proof and theseare almost a full length on me so ifyou're a little shorter these will befull length but if you are tallerthey're probably more like basicallyseven eighths they have the same innerdouble gusset crotch or extended gussetcrotchthese have no seam so if you don't likesorry these have no logo so if you don'tlike logos then these are great but Iactually these they felt they felt alittle more stiff when I was holdingthem up but when I'm trying them onthey're actually really stretchy and Idon't know they feel like the old-schoollike who IMed wonder under fabric but inthe align shape in almost a littlesofter not soft event Alliance butsofter than the original move it was soI think that's all I have to say onthese they're slightly lower rise itgoes about to my bellybutton but Ibecame that but none of these also lovethe colorokay the last ones are probably like a 9out of 10 so these would be like aneight this final pair are these rounddangwomen's yoga pants with pocket Powerflextummy control fries okay you know didlook like a Capri I think these are alsolike if something's like you know itsays the free you can't trust these arethe cheapest they're 1899 and they havethis color which is like a wine colorthey have black same kind of blue as thelast air or the green but a lilac graypurple royal blue and regular gray sothese I definitely have the biggestcolor rangethey almost like it feel exactly likethe Aloha ones but they also have thisthe same inner pocketthe only difference is they do have alittle logo says the Rio Grande orwhatever it is again very similar backseams no pop seam extended guts a crotchthese just feels very very similar likebelow hot yoga are a little softeralmost a little more like the actualLululemon ones but they're about thesame weight so I feel like they're bothgoing to be pretty thick again these arenylon spandex these are they're almostexactly this our leggings are made with87 percent nylon and 29 percentif you ask me that just doesn't add upto 100 so that's interesting but yeah Idon't really know what to what stressthat okay size range is also extra smallto extra large so it's pretty good solet's see how these are on so alreadythese are my least favorite I justreally kind of struggled to get them onI don't know if they're like they runtoo small but I did mention that like upI'm literally out of breath to try theseon um I did mention that they felt alittle stiffer and they definitely arethey're just they don't feel quite aslike they're not hugging me in all theright places they're not they're justnot like sliding onto my bodyeffortlessly and they don't feel likeweight look I feel constricted ifanything when it just feels tight andwhat I have a pair of leggings I'm alsoa dancer so I like them to be like veryflexible so I can like stretch with themand I feel constrained and I'm feelingkind of constrained in these um yeahalso these are the only ones if a logo Idon't love this logo I don't know itjust kind of said their name again itgoes about up to the belly button hasthe same little inner pocket same gets acrotch it's the cottony material butit's almost got the shininess because Ijust feel like they're so stiffI don't know terms of camel toe we don'treally have any their squat proof youare about the same like just about theankle on me a tall person yeah I justthese are just not know I'm gonna Ithink these are going to be returnedthey're just yeah unfortunately thecheapest but you know that one's partnerexpensive so we don't get last that arecap of the cr-z yoga's to have a veryfull size range color range is a littlemad but if you just like you know darkneutral colors that it's perfect for youthey feel they form to your bodyincredibly well they feel so smooth andthey fit they hit me at a perfect pointon my waist and the waistband is superflattering and I just these just feellike you're wearing nothing and theystretch any way your body wants tostretch so I I think I change this tolike well these are my first favorite inthis video except for the color rangeI do like classical leggings but theseare so nice now could they get low hasee other leggings I actually did thinkthis would be a great actually take outpretty good reviews but these are justthey feel they almost feel like thelittle bit of fabric and maybe a littledefinitely a little thicker but there'snot thicker in a way that constrains youI feel they feel almost as form-fittingas the cr-z yogas but just a little bitof a thicker material perhaps better foryou know winter okay like almost now andI felt like these really let me stretchanyway I wanted I got them on veryeasily and didn't feel like I wasstruggling to like pull them up I reallyliked these these are definitely mysecond favorite it's not tied forfavorite and finally the rounding he'sactually got like four and a half starson Amazon I they just felt a littleconstructing on me I really struggled toget them on and when I did I just feltlike I didn't have my full range ofmotion which is something I look for ina workout pant I like to be able to liveas much as I want to because you knowyou are trying to move when you'reworking out hopefully they have the samewaistband so the waistband is firing butbasically they're exactly the same asthe lo Cascio Gerbert Aloha's yoga are alota more form-fitting and flexible so youcan move a lot more in these and thesejust feel more constricting perhapsthese might be a size too small for me Imight feel different things if I triedon a medium except instead of a small soyou might be able to get away with thesebeing a little more flexible if you wentwith a size up so I'd say the first twoare definitely true to size and this onedoes run a little small but I feel likethese are just even if you've got abigger size they're just not quite asstretchy they just feel a little moreconstricting but they are they are spotproof and not sheer at all so definitelya win on those so all of these leggingsfeel like very high quality very thickand I'm impressed with the qualityoverall I just say with the cr-zand the low Hoss you're gonna get moreof a smoother material and a moreform-fitting look which I just prefer alot more so I hope this helped you guysand I hope maybe you tried this I thinkout because I am definitely going to begetting a lot of use out of these forsure maybe they'll show up in afavorites video I don't know but yeahthank you guys so much for watching Ihope you enjoy you know $20 Amazon we'llsee you guys bye[Music],22,UCqOC1SiA6v994Sx_WR1-xew,Kathryn Mueller,113,22,0,936,"['Raorandang', 'lululemon align dupe', 'Lohas yoga', 'lululemon

just because these do feela little thicker but yeah anyway theseare 2299 with Prime and they come inthis color they come in a little reddishpink of midnight blue and I look kind oflike a dark lilacso good color range and these are nylonspandex materials the low hatha-yoga hasa size extra small to extra large theseare also 7 8wait so you know that good for shorterpeople or I'm tall and I kind of likethe side things like so call mepersonally one drawback of all theseliking videos I just get really hot I'mtrying them all on but anyways I'mwearing too low ha Co go right now andI'm liking with a lot more than Ithoughtthe material is definitely thicker thanthe last one and it's that like cottonII know shine material there's no cottonin it but I just feel it more cottony tome um camel toe let's see not really Idon't really find an issue since thesearen't seamless they don't even get alot of camel toe [ __ ] proof and theseare almost a full length on me so ifyou're a little shorter these will befull length but if you are tallerthey're probably more like basicallyseven eighths they have the same innerdouble gusset crotch or extended gussetcrotchthese have no seam so if you don't likesorry these have no logo so if you don'tlike logos then these are great but Iactually these they felt they felt alittle more stiff when I was holdingthem up but when I'm trying them onthey're actually really stretchy and Idon't know they feel like the old-schoollike who IMed wonder under fabric but inthe align shape in almost a littlesofter not soft event Alliance butsofter than the original move it was soI think that's all I have to say onthese they're slightly lower rise itgoes about to my bellybutton but Ibecame that but none of these also lovethe colorokay the last ones are probably like a 9out of 10 so these would be like aneight this final pair are these rounddangwomen's yoga pants with pocket Powerflextummy control fries okay you know didlook like a Capri I think these are alsolike if something's like you know itsays the free you can't trust these arethe cheapest they're 1899 and they havethis color which is like a wine colorthey have black same kind of blue as thelast air or the green but a lilac graypurple royal blue and regular gray sothese I definitely have the biggestcolor rangethey almost like it feel exactly likethe Aloha ones but they also have thisthe same inner pocketthe only difference is they do have alittle logo says the Rio Grande orwhatever it is again very similar backseams no pop seam extended guts a crotchthese just feels very very similar likebelow hot yoga are a little softeralmost a little more like the actualLululemon ones but they're about thesame weight so I feel like they're bothgoing to be pretty thick again these arenylon spandex these are they're almostexactly this our leggings are made with87 percent nylon and 29 percentif you ask me that just doesn't add upto 100 so that's interesting but yeah Idon't really know what to what stressthat okay size range is also extra smallto extra large so it's pretty good solet's see how these are on so alreadythese are my least favorite I justreally kind of struggled to get them onI don't know if they're like they runtoo small but I did mention that like upI'm literally out of breath to try theseon um I did mention that they felt alittle stiffer and they definitely arethey're just they don't feel quite aslike they're not hugging me in all theright places they're not they're justnot like sliding onto my bodyeffortlessly and they don't feel likeweight look I feel constricted ifanything when it just feels tight andwhat I have a pair of leggings I'm alsoa dancer so I like them to be like veryflexible so I can like stretch with themand I feel constrained and I'm feelingkind of constrained in these um yeahalso these are the only ones if a logo Idon't love this logo I don't know itjust kind of said their name again itgoes about up to the belly button hasthe same little inner pocket same gets acrotch it's the cottony material butit's almost got the shininess because Ijust feel like they're so stiffI don't know terms of camel toe we don'treally have any their squat proof youare about the same like just about theankle on me a tall person yeah I justthese are just not know I'm gonna Ithink these are going to be returnedthey're just yeah unfortunately thecheapest but you know that one's partnerexpensive so we don't get last that arecap of the cr-z yoga's to have a veryfull size range color range is a littlemad but if you just like you know darkneutral colors that it's perfect for youthey feel they form to your bodyincredibly well they feel so smooth andthey fit they hit me at a perfect pointon my waist and the waistband is superflattering and I just these just feellike you're wearing nothing and theystretch any way your body wants tostretch so I I think I change this tolike well these are my first favorite inthis video except for the color rangeI do like classical leggings but theseare so nice now could they get low hasee other leggings I actually did thinkthis would be a great actually take outpretty good reviews but these are justthey feel they almost feel like thelittle bit of fabric and maybe a littledefinitely a little thicker but there'snot thicker in a way that constrains youI feel they feel almost as form-fittingas the cr-z yogas but just a little bitof a thicker material perhaps better foryou know winter okay like almost now andI felt like these really let me stretchanyway I wanted I got them on veryeasily and didn't feel like I wasstruggling to like pull them up I reallyliked these these are definitely mysecond favorite it's not tied forfavorite and finally the rounding he'sactually got like four and a half starson Amazon I they just felt a littleconstructing on me I really struggled toget them on and when I did I just feltlike I didn't have my full range ofmotion which is something I look for ina workout pant I like to be able to liveas much as I want to because you knowyou are trying to move when you'reworking out hopefully they have the samewaistband so the waistband is firing butbasically they're exactly the same asthe lo Cascio Gerbert Aloha's yoga are alota more form-fitting and flexible so youcan move a lot more in these and thesejust feel more constricting perhapsthese might be a size too small for me Imight feel different things if I triedon a medium except instead of a small soyou might be able to get away with thesebeing a little more flexible if you wentwith a size up so I'd say the first twoare definitely true to size and this onedoes run a little small but I feel likethese are just even if you've got abigger size they're just not quite asstretchy they just feel a little moreconstricting but they are they are spotproof and not sheer at all so definitelya win on those so all of these leggingsfeel like very high quality very thickand I'm impressed with the qualityoverall I just say with the cr-zand the low Hoss you're gonna get moreof a smoother material and a moreform-fitting look which I just prefer alot more so I hope this helped you guysand I hope maybe you tried this I thinkout because I am definitely going to begetting a lot of use out of these forsure maybe they'll show up in afavorites video I don't know but yeahthank you guys so much for watching Ihope you enjoy you know $20 Amazon we'llsee you guys bye[Music],17,UC4yq3FWEWqMvFNFBsV3gbKQ,힙으뜸,93,219,0,796,"['심으뜸', '룰루레몬 레깅스', '룰루레몬 레깅스 종류', '룰루레몬 리뷰', '룰루레몬 소재', '룰루레몬 가성비', '룰루레몬 매트',

and then in theback it's just totally plain so I don'tknow Kiera crop topTimothy Spacek it's cropped love it itkind of reminds me of brandy melville ina way it's 10 bucks but I really do lovethe print it's super cutenext shirt is from Kyra once again and Ibelieve this is like six bucks and thisone is actually a bit more softer thanthe other ones brandy melville so thisis their Sachi halter top so I

likecertain styles while to be free it'slike always sold out and people are overpricing them on eBay and it's so sicklike it like oh it's like people buythem purposely to resell them for ahigher price

forthemselves at retail price I haven'tbought one sports bra from Lulu thatwasn't under or at retail price this isthe only Lulu these two are the onlythings that I bought like a lower pricebut guys please stop doing that that'sreally not nice because people like usdon't want to spend over retail I boughttwo of those sports bras that are overretail and it's kind of annoying in away like I know people actually do thatjust to get money and that's really likeselfish why do you want to spend 90bucks for something that could have been46 bucks at store like really oh I needmy coffeeI know Lulu

hey guys so today's video is going to bea clothing and fashion haul from my tripto LA for VidCon the week before lastit's gone really quickly since I've gotback I know I got back quite a while agoI did actually film a beauty haul withmy friend Lily if you guys haven't seenthat already it is up on my channel andi thought i would do a clothing haul aswell i'm seeing as i missed an uploadwhilst i was at VidCon and only did oneupload that week I thought I would do alittle bonus video today for you guys tosee just because I normally upload twicea week and I felt really bad notuploading twice so yeah I hope you guysenjoy this little bonus midweek videostarting off with clothing while it'sall clothing but there is one jewelryitem which I'm super excited to show youyeah I picked up quite a lot of dressesactually and I don't really know why Ididn't go shopping there with theintention of buying anything specificbut the first place that I got quite afew dresses from was Bloomingdale's theyhad an amazing sale on like a crazy salewhere they had like already reducedstuff that was like an extra 40% off ofsome another and then when you spent $50you got $20 off so I ended up picking uptwo dresses from the brand aqua which isone of their kind of more affordableranges that they stock improving nailsthe first one is this pink polka dotdress which has stripes at the bottomthis is just a really lightweight funpretty girly dress it's a little bitBarbie I have to admit they actuallyonly had this in a medium so it's alittle bit big but it's very becauseit's wasted you can easily built it soI'm definitely built this when I wear itit's all ruched on the front that'sreally flattering really light and funto wear and I have a couple of tripsleft this summer so I wanted a couple ofsome dresses that I could wear and yes Ireally like this and this was reducedfrom $88 to 44 so it's half price andthen like I said if you spent $50 yougot $20 off so I got that one and then Ialso got this one which is from againthe same brand and this was around $60so together they were 100 so therefore Igot $40 off so I got them both for 60which is a really good price this wasoriginally 88 as well it's like a purplekind of slightly like tie-dye at the topand then it goes into like normal floralprint and bottom it's purple blue andpink I don't knowa lot of purple but I just really likedthis the cost of it it's reallyflattering I ended up getting this in anextra small so I got this one in anextra small and this one in a medium sothey're kind of the kind of dresses thatare elasticated at the waist as well soit doesn't really matter what size youget but I tried on the small and thisand it had quite a lot of excess fabricaround like my boobs and stuff becauseI'm a bit smaller on top than I have onbottom so yeah so I got an exercise onthis and they were a really good pricefor super super stuff with those and Ithink that I will get a lot of wear outof them in the last kind of couple ofmonths of warm weather that we've got Ialso picked up something that wasn't inthe sale from Free People which I loveand if you see my get ready with mevideo that I uploaded this week you willhave seen this already it's actuallyNavy but it has a black kind of underlayer underneath it which is kind oflike a fishnet starts at see-through youdefinitely have to wear like either abando or a strapless bra with it andthen it has almost like a toga effectbelt around the middle which it's kindof I don't know something about this Ijust really really liked the quality ofthe fabric is gorgeous which sometimesthe three people because they're quiteexpensive everything this was about $120so it was a bit of a splurge butsometimes the fabric is not very nicethe fabric on this is such such gorgeousquality and it has like the ruchingaround the neck and just like all of thelittle like ties at the bottom areplaited I just like it's really prettyit's very very comfortable I actuallywore it twice when I was out in LA and Ireally liked it it's just very very easyto wear comfortable and good for kind ofday today Ruby it would be really goodfor the beach as well and just kind ofhanging out really like that a lot and Ialso picked up something from Lululemonand I have to say especially in the UKLululemon is so expensive it's one ofthe most expensive workout gear brandsout there and I don't normally buy a lotof stuff if I go over there I think I'vegot like a couple of outfits from therein total over the years but they last sowell you know you can pair them to kindof Nike and your generic kind of likestandard high street brands and I lovelike the Nike Fitness leggingyou love them but they go see-throughafter about six months to a year for meand that's just I don't know they'restill pretty expensive and I just thinkI'd rather spend a bit more and havethem for numerous years which is what myLululemon want to do I've had some ofthem for like two years plus and theyare still like they look like new so Ispotted these in the sale and I ended uppicking them up there a little bitgarishbut I would definitely wear these withlike a plain grey top a lot of the otherexercise gear I have it's quite plainand these were reduced from $100 to $60which is about 40 pounds so it's stillquite expensive but with the discountthey're similar price or a little bitcheaper than the normal kind of Nikeones and the actual fabric is so thickthat I think these will last a very longtime I love the way the seams are cut aswell they're just really flattering youlemon always have really flatteringlines on all the gear and they have alittle zip pocket as well and I justyeah I really like these I don't knowreally fun they're almost like that kindof smashed glass kind of tinfoilApostoli effect really liked them and Igot them in a u.s. size 6 which is a UK10 pretty standard sizing in Lululemon Ifind them pretty much always the six andthen I picked up a pair of shoes fromGAAP which I've actually worn a lot ifyou watch my vlogs from VidCon you'llhave seen these but they are these lasercups sandals I basically forgot to packsome kind of neutral flats when I wentto LA it's one of those things thatyou're just like I totally overlooked itand we're packing and I only packed likesilver metallic sandals that didn'treally go with any of my other outfit soI kind of had a bit of panic when I wasthere and I was looking for kind of nudetan sandals that weren't too distinctivethat would kind of go with everything sohard to find but I ended up findingthese ones they were the last pair inthe gap sale and they were off amannequin and I managed to convince theguys to let me have them off themannequin and there were seventeendollars so that's just over ten pounds Iwore them loads I really liked them Ibelieve they are real leather as well soyeah hopefully they'll last quite a longtime really like these a lot thatlaser-cut tan with a little ankle strapreally nice really comfy they are halfthe size two smokes they were the lastparentless so desperately I bought themanyway so they're a little bit small butlike not too small enough anyone elsereallyapart from me so yes they are my sandalsand then the last clothing item I boughtwas a bit of a special purchase becauseI have a very very special event comingup I ended up picking this one up fromMarsh in the sale again fromBloomingdale's and it's just gorgeous Ireally really love the cut of this it'sactually difficult show on camerabecause it's white but it has tiny blackpolka dots all over it's much easier tosee kind of in person it's just gorgeousit has this kind of like ruched ribbingon the front that's flattering on thesides and then it has loads of kind ofextra fabric in the skirt so it feelsreally squishy and swishy not squishyswishy and princessy when you wear itand then the back is an open back and ithas this tie along the like top of theback which i think is really elegant andpretty and again this was about 60% offMarge is one of those brands like alwayslook in the shop because I love theirstuff but they're so expensive I onlyever really by the occasional thing fromthem when it's at the end of the salelike massively discounted because Ithink originally this dress was likefour hundred and eighty dollars orsomethingso yeah it was very very welldiscounting them with the exchange rateit was a really good price so I got thisin a size two they're sizing reallyconfuses me because a lot of the time inMarch I'll be a size one but thensometimes obvious size - and this haslike not the most stretchy waistbandthen you have to fit it over yourshoulders so the size one if it had hada zip in it I would've been able to getit on and it would have fitted likereally snugly but the size - becauseit's stretch I had to actually like makesure I could get it with my shouldersbecause there's no zip on it anyway I'mwaffling so yeah I picked this up in asize 2 which they're not normal sizingin March they have like one two threeinstead of like eight ten twelve kind ofsituation and so yeah I picked this upin a size two and I really loved it andI'm hoping to pair it with my severeWebster savanna shoes if you guysremember me putting those in video acouple of months ago they're like myblack and white ones a little orangedetail on the bottom and I'm hoping thisis going to be the perfect dress forthat event and then the final purchaseI'm actually wearing right noware these little crawler earringsactually have some hair caught in themfrom forever21 and I spotted these andthen one of those items that you know nomatter where you spot them obviously notif they were like thousands of poundsbut if they've been quite expensive Iwould have wanted them as well because Ijust love the design so much and it justhappened that I was lucky and it was inforever 21 and they were $5 I absolutelyadore these they are gold crawlerearrings with stars on them and theyhave little time on taste I'm gonna do aclose-up so you guys can see but it'sreally dainty and pretty they were oneof my favorite things that I found onthe trip and they were only five dollarsdon't you love it when that happensI do so that is it for this haul video Ireally really hope you guys enjoy it Ihope you're having a great day bye I'vegot a little bit of a different videofor you guys so firstly what really bigexciting announcement that I have beenhaving to keep secret for ages and soexcited too,26,UC1-szPBG7Oh4icM1FcQakQg,Fleur DeForce,239,88,0,5782,"['la', 'haul', 'free', 'people', 'lululemon',

hey guys welcome back to my channel Ihope you're having a great day today'svideo is a Lululemon haul and trying onvideo I told you guys in my last videothat I went to New York City forChristmas my husband surprised me withthe trip and while I was there I did atiny bit of shopping I only bought a eyecream but then I did some serious damageat Lululemon so if you would like to seewhat I got at Lululemon and watch me tryit on then just keep watchingso when I was shopping at Lululemon Iwas basically looking for some tops andlike jackets not really pants or shortsI already have a ton of short then Ialready have quite a few pairs of tightslong tights and props Heights so I didget one pair of cropped tights because Ilike to wear them to run on thetreadmill because the shorts kind oflike will start to bug me sometimes sothese are just the cropped you knowtypical black tights they are ventingand the legs here and we even know ifyou're gonna be able to tell but there'sventing and the legs of these tights andcame out with typical Lululemon it's gota little pocket in your back so you canput something in there which is reallygross like what are you gonna put inthere money and then like go to thestore and be like here's my sweatingmoney and I want to buy something so Inever use that pocket but I do reallylike these tights and I like to wearthem when I know I'm going to be runninga lot and then I needed something towear home on the airplane and because Ididn't bring enough clothes I'm not surehow that had the products I didn't knowI was going there when we left there itwas like 40 degrees it was really coldbut I already have two pairs of longLululemon pants like the little bellbottom kind of ones that I'll wearsometimes to work out or I'll just wearyou know out and about whatever so Ididn't want to buy another pair thoselike $120 and I don't need three pairsliving in Florida I already have a tightpair that's tight all the way down thatyou can wear with like boots or whateverso I didn't want those and so I foundthese pants and they were on the salerack and they're like the last pair andI know why they are so ugly but I lovethem and I was like if they're like 40dollars and then this really wide bottomand it's just like a really wide leg allthe wayand then it is like really high superhigh waisted crotch area right herewhere my elbow is I'm so bad Ness sothey are really high waisted a and Ihave a long torso and they're stillreally high waisted but they are supercomfortable they happen to be my sizewhat they have left and a favorite theywould just be like really good likeHouse lounge pants and they are they'reawesome and then I got three tops andI'm sure I've fun tops I have a ton ofthose power Y tops but when you when Iwork out I might feel like there's toolike chesty like they're just showing mychest off a little bit too much so Iwanted to get some that came up furtherand so I got this purple one and it doescome up I'll try it on but it comes upfurther on my chest further than thepower Y does and then it just has likethis crisscross back which is reallycute and then it just has like that's abook will kind of a little bit looserdown at the bottom which is great foryou know working out I got a white oneand I got this one because it comes upreally high also so this one comes upyou know further more like that and thenit has a really sassy crisscross backit's hardyeah so it has the really sassycrisscross back and that's really cuteand this is all like vented materialright here and then it has like a looseyou know bottom also I got this blackand gray one I love black and gray and Ihave a great jacket and so this would beanti black jacket so this will go willand mix-and-match with what I alreadyhave but it looks like this at the topand then it has the cute like blackright here which this is not as itmelted yeah this is like a little bitvented here there's two layers there butthen again it has like this sassy littlecrisscross back which is super cute andthe loose you know kind of looser on meand then I wanted some tops not to workout in but if I was just gonna wearworkout clothes if I'm not doinganything if I'm just like poppin mallgrocery store like lame boring errandsthat I can just kind of where myLululemon stuff or not like get alldressed up I'm being lazy so I got at-shirt and I only got one of these andI love this shirt it just fits it's justlike a little exercise material likestretching material so you could wearthis with an exercise bra also which Inot typically do but maybe I will try itout but it's just it's not you knowtypical standard t-shirt but it fitsreally well and it is just really reallycomfortable I really like this materialI got two long-sleeve ones I got thisgray and white one so it looks like thatand then in the fact that cause likeit's like a little bit of ruching righthere to allow for movement so again youcould wear this with the exercise topbut I got them just basically the wayaround town but I thought this would gowith my gray jacket that I had out witha black jacket and I have a white jacketalso and then I just got this dark grayone same kind of thing just kind of ascoop neck top same like ruching in theback to allow for movement but this oneis really cool because on the sleeve ofthis one the one where that's on yourleft sleeve and has a hole right here soyou can see your watch which is reallycool like if you're wearing a Fitbit youcan you know look at your Fitbit or yourApple watch or whatever it is that wereregular watch so I thought that that wasreally cool that you could like have alittle hidey-hole for your watch and ofcourse they both have the little thumbholes so you can wear on your hand I gotthis vest I saw this on an email and Iwas like oh oh it's so cute but it was$200 but they hadn't was like no way butthey had it in the store and I was 50%off maybe just because it was like thelast couple sizes of this color and soit's just little you know puffy vast andit has pockets and the zipper twopockets and then it has like littlepockets here also and you could storeall kinds offrom this mess but you know we're goingskiing also so you could use this as askiingbike layer and some of these others thelong-sleeve shirts I could use is ascheme layer also but in Florida youknow it'll be cold in the morning andthen why the afternoon it's hot so it'salways like really good to have likelayering stuff to take off the lastthing I got is a super cute white jacketokay so it's white jacket looks likethat it's like a cream it's almost likea cream color and then it's like a whitehere on this material here but I foundhis pockets and then the zipper and thenon the back it has like a little ventingaction here and this all inside thispocket is all like a romantic rightthere and then it has this super cutelike puffy material hood but the thingthat's really cool about this jacket isthis puffy material hood is like a vestbut it's like a half a mess it onlycomes down to its shorter and then itjust attaches to the jacket in the backwith this one like little string thatyou put through like a loop and so youcan take the whole you can take thiswhole part out and then there's a wholepocket right here in the back I meanLululemon really thinks that you have tolike store a bunch of stuff from out ofa huge pocket and the back you want to Idon't know store stuff in your back butthis just adds an extra layer to thejacket so if you want it you can have itif you don't want it you don't have tohave it like this when you have it onI'll show you you can't wear this codeif you have makeup on I wore in New Yorkand I had makeI got makeup on the jacket so it'sreally just it just like sits up here onyour face a little bit too much but thenwithout that in there it's just liketypical jacket on the inside and thenit's just much lighter this way and thenthe venting would be more effective sothis makes it warmer that is all I gotand now I'm going to attempt to zoom youout and I will show you real quick whatit looks liketryam video give it a thumbs up if youliked it so I know that you like halltry on videos and I'll do some more

hi everyone abby here today i'm going tobe reviewing the ariseyoga mat from lululemon but before i getstarted make sure to hit that subscribebutton so you can help the channel growand so you can stay tuned to all my newvideos dropping weeklyso this is the arize 5 millimeter mattefrom lululemonthey actually call on the website rightnow a rise map made with fsc certifiedrubber five millimetersso the color i purchased was calledpixel print matte alpine whitesilver and i do want to say i've hadthis map for nine months now so i feellike i can give you guys an accuratereviewso i purchased this yoga mat tobasically do some beginners yoga and todo my floor exercisesum like doing home workouts that type ofthingand it's definitely a great mat um forthose purposesi do want to mention that i don't do hotyoga so i don't like sweat profusely onthe mat but i'm justkind of giving you guys a review basedon how i use it so this is the firstlululemonyoga mat that is made of sustainablysourced rubberum i think it's great that they're doingthat and they're giving you knowconsumers the option to buysustainably stores products instead ofbuying you know just one that was justmade out of rubber that waskind of sourced the old-fashioned wayand it does cost a little more becauseof thatthis one does also have an antimicrobialadditiveon the layer here which helps preventlike mold and mildew fromgrowing on your mat and it does havethat nice absorbentlayer it is an open cell yoga mat so itdoes absorb your sweat and stuffand when you are working out on it itdefinitely is grippywhich is great so i'm just going to do aclose-up now and show you guys the printup close so this is what it looks likeup closeum i think this print is absolutelygorgeousand one great thing about this print isthat it hides sweat like nobody'sbusiness it is amazingi know a lot of people think that blackyoga mats are the best of hiding sweatbutin my experience that's just not true ido find that prints specificallydo hide sweat the most i know somepeople aren't concerned with that butfor me i doappreciate when your mat does kind ofhide your sweat um because if i wasgoing to take this into a studio youknow like pre-coveredi definitely would be a little bitself-conscious if my mat was covered insweat and it's really noticeable so i'mgoing to go ahead and do likemy little water sweat test to show youguys how the mat looks when it does getwetso i'm just going to put a little bit ofwater in my finger there andso honestly you can hardly really noticeiti'm going to zoom in a little bit closerso it's wet like kind of right here butthis printum as i was saying is really good athiding kind of sweatand water marks so that's definitely abenefit of getting you know a print likethisor kind of their other prints in generali find that the prints are definitelythe best bet for a hiding spot becausethey do have a bunch of different colorsall together and basically when your matgets wetit's not like as noticeable because youdon't have one solid color that'ssuddenly darkenedso i do want to mention that this yogamat in particular the arize yoga matis one-sided it is not reversible so youcan only practice on this sidefor me i definitely do like this side ithink it's comfortable to useit is very very grippyso when you are on here and you're doingany type of poses it's going to keep youstill um this material in particularis soft so when i've used the reversiblematin the past it's definitely kind of likea harder material so this is softer so ifind that you kind of likesink more if that makes sense if i'mhopefully i'm explaining that properlybut you kind of sink more when you aredoing certain poses it's notuncomfortablebut that's just something to notice sothis is their standard size yoga mat i'mgoing to go ahead and post thedimensions for you on screenand i do want to say that i am 5 8 andthisyoga mat length is perfect for me i canlie down completely on itand my feet just kind of touch thebottom they don't hang over at allif you are taller though you might wantto consider getting their bigmat which has an extended width andlength for people who are kind of tallerthan six feeti do want to mention a con about thisyoga mat so this material in particulardoes attract some kind of lint pet hairum crumbs or anything like that likecrazyi don't know why but like with lululemonyoga mats i find that's definitely anissuewith this one it's no exception so ijust wanted to let you guys know thatthat is the con that i have noticedabout this map like i did say i've hadthis map for nine months nowand i want to show you guys there's notype of discoloration on my mati haven't had that issue at all i doknow that some people do have issueswith discoloration on their matsso i just wanted to quickly point outthat i haven't had that issuealso i'm going to do a close-up ihaven't experienced any scratching onthis matand i just use my yoga mat with my barefeet i don't wear anyshoes or anything with it and this isnine months old so i think it's holdingupamazingly it's really durable um in myopinion it's definitely more durablethan the reversible mat that they dohaveand i think it looks practically brandnew and it's nine months oldum they did go ahead and shove a logo onthis side i'm not quite sure why becauseyou can't practice on this side buti mean it's nice to have it there thisside is just meant to keep your yoga matjust stuck to the groundso you're not moving around and you'redoing any of your posesso just considering like the color thequality the functionality everythinglike thati would definitely go ahead and givethis mat a 9.4 out of 10.and i do give it a thumbs up if you areinterested in purchasing this i'm justgoing to post a link for the arise matin the description below alright sothat's all for today thanks for watchingguys and make sure to like comment andsubscribebye,22,UCY3_f-t8VBYh9rq8iHS-kdg,AbbyBReviewing,0,0,0,9,No Tags,Lululemon Arise

buy two so here theyareokay i'm going to be trying them on andi'm going to compare them to my belovedlululemonsand i'm going to let you know what ithink so here we goso this is one of the ones that i boughtnow i like the thickness of the fabric ifeel like it really does hold youthey call their fabric bionic which ithought was cool because it reminds meof like the bionic man you knowand if it could make me feel strongerthat's awesomeuh in reality it's just uh like it'slatexand uh poly you know it's just a blendbut it's really thick which is awesomeso i'm not afraid thatif i like bend over that you can seelike my underwear or something like thatyou know and i feel like i'm reallycovered and i'm held in all the rightplaces that's the good thingi also like the pattern a lot i thinkit's so cutei love that it goes really high upbecause it hidesall of like my tummy my son washumongous he was like 10 poundsso i and i gained 60 pounds while i waspregnantso trust me i have some loose skin goingon in there so i'm really happy to havethisup here as opposed to below my bellybutton okay now i'm gonna try on thesecond onethis is the other one that i gotnow why did i get these i like lilac alot but i love the fact that they saidthat it was like a snake skin printcan you see it oh yeah it's cool i seeithere's the let down it is not snakeprint everywhere in the backoh it's your weight put your leg on theside yeah the differencea flex can you tell i'm flexingokay so the back is not the sametexture as the front i really wanted itto bethe same texture front and back ithought that would be a lot coolerhere's where i think they could havedone things a little bit differentlylet me show you okay guys so here ismy final verdict on dyi define yourinspiration workout pantsversus lululemons okay now i love thefabric i like the different types ofprints i think it's reallyfun their price is interesting alsobut there's one thing that bothers me umi'm going to show you quickly but i kindof have a camel toe people i don't wanta camel toenow why does it do that well check thisout lululemons yes they are expensivebut check this outthis is one panel of fabric can you seethisi don't know if you can see this they'reblack okay but look all of this is onepanel of fabricyeah now if you guys know anything aboutsewing and cutting patternsthis cutting this whole one panelwithout a stitch here like this one hasa stitch right heresorry i'm putting it in my crotch butit's importantthis is more wasteful okay more wastefullike well you end up wasting more fabriclike if you cut out two pieces you knowyou can like manage to save more fabricso yeah it cuts down cost see here againyou have a stitch down the middle ofyour crotchso everything else i love i love thefabrici love the pattern i wish that theywould do like lululemon and not havea center stitch lemons yeah did i saythatoh sorry well i wish that they would dolike lululemons andnot do a center stitch you know justhave one panel of fabricbecause i think that could avoid for alot of girls and women you know having acamel toeso it's like i feel like if i wear theseevery time i go to the bathroom i'm kindof going to beadjusting it or trying maybe puttingsome toilet paper folded upso that the the center uh stitch doesn'tlike goyou know in and cause a nice littlecamel toeso that's it ladies will i be purchasingthem againhey

themin the dryer these things are amazing ihaven't watched these yet but iall of the reviews that i've read werereally positive on that endso because of the patterns because ofthe price because of theyou know the sense of the fabric likehow it feels on me like how it holds mei would say that i would buy them againbut just cautionif you've got like a chubby vaginado not get these because it will justemphasize youryour camel toe okay um i can't say thati dobut all i can say is that it doeskind of have a tendency to get all youcan say is that this is kind ofturning into a weird subject it's not aweird subject it's important no i knowso important for women i'm telling youand you knowalready you're wearing like if you'rewearing pants like these you knowyou want to make sure that everything isjust being held in the rightway and that's part of it so justbuy or beware if youif if you worry about this maybe theseare not the pants for youso other than that i like them i wishthat with the snake pattern it had beenthe samein the front as in the back that wouldhave been cool i feel a littlelet down by that other than that thispattern iseven more beautiful you can't seeanything can't see it becausenow we see it yeah this pattern is evenmore beautiful in real life thanin their website on their website thiskind of looked whiteand it's actually the palest shade ofpink really pale pale

youyouhi everyone so I just want to jump rightinto today's video so I built this hallalready just like I told you guys goingon my so now I know what it it had a newcandle today bath and Bodyworksand it is fresh balsam fir and althoughit smelled like Christmas trees it isvery sentence yeah I wanted to film thisvideo for you guys earlier and I diddidn't turn out quite the way that Iwanted it to so here I am refilling itit is December 14 and I'm a few daysbehind on my blog so I have lots morecoming for you guys I'm going to addthis video I'm going to either put it infront of the video or I'm going to tackit on the end of some training footagethat I got from elitist summer tents I'mgonna guesslet's get started so okay I got thiscute dress from forever 21 just blackand it's body con is a shorter dressthat I planned to era tights thematerial oh there we go so it's a littlebit of a rimmed material almost feelslike it should be pajamas to be honestbut um yeah pretty sure if you put acubes here flip it and some nice tightsget them could dress it up you know soyeah a long see black dress it's companyis nothing smell a long time thisbecause there's kind of like a basic butit's a long sleeved like kind of shortturtleneck top from forever 21 oh yeah Iforgot about this I got this niceburgundy color skirt and I love theburgundy color like it's like actually avery deep almost Brittany plum color andI really am loving it with my color hairso I think it goes really nice with thatand and look how cute the burgundy colorlooks with the faux fur like kind of thegreytopher so I almost want to go back toforever 21 and get myself like cute forjacket this color or fur vest my friendright hand has a fur vest I really likeit look how cute I'm so pretty it looksit looks dark and displayed but it is Imean I got another skirt from forever 21and this one is very similar to the lastone actually fits a little bit betterand it's it's like silky material it'ssilky stretchy kind of spandex but it'sribbed and it won't probably won't focuson its thinner ribs in the dress but umit actually looks really dressy on so Ilike that I post it on my Instagram Ithink probably probably over a week agonow but how I like clothes that arecomfyfirst and foremost and then if they lookgood that's good after that so that'swhy I like live in leggings just if I amgoing to dress up I'm going to want towear something that's still comfortableand these body con skirts and thedresses like in the con or this nicestretchy material are what is reallycookie so yeah oh oh yeah as I'mchecking out I always get caught up inlooking at the items at the checkoutthey always get me this headband itactually goes like this with a bow onthe outsideI was just looking for headbands forwinter to go around my ears like earwarmers and I find that the knitted onesalthough they look really cute they tendto make my skin really itchy and sweatyand my hair really staticky so I wasreally hoping to find headbands later atthe cotton material and I get betterwhen I turn it inside it was kind of alittle turban thing so actually try iton for youyou ready make it around in your boxlike this okay you got me most I needyou upoh it's a cute one in the gray and thenI also got the black one so this is whatthe black one looks like these ones werefor ninety by the way so we'll need fivebucks it's really good so the black oneis just the turban style and hementioned that one for you just go toCenter with a little bit hittingprobably I saw this on a girl that Ifollows Instagram she just put her hairup like this in a bun Simo bun on top soI might try that as well when I got myhair done laughs it was white if youremember or recalled from my earliervlogs but it was pretty much just whitelike platinum and I went in because Iwanted a darker silver like it is nowand I asked do that and then she putlike a permanent dye in and it ended upsitting on too long and I turned my hairblack like black like this color blackit's like a swampy blackish green colorand it's really bad so I ended up havingto get stripped like twice after that toget it back to the lightness that it wasbefore so it was actually traumatized Igot a toned after that and since thenI've been doing all the repair in thetoning myself because I'm traumatizedand I don't really trust your stylistanymore I have a lot of breakage aroundmy hairline as you can see here and Iwas really bad for a while but it'sstarting to grow back in oh I can'treally look cute in buns but with theseheadbands I can kind of hide thatbreakage and it goes all around the backof my head so when I put my hair up in aponytail it's actually really thinwhereas before I used to have a reallythick ponytailyeah I think it's worth it in the endlike it's a really pretty color now andif you guys want me to do a video on howI color and tone my hair just let meknow comment down below and I can do oneof those I actually need to tone itpretty soon again here so I might filmit if you guys are interested and then Igot two bras so I got this sports braand it's kind of key because it has alittle bit of the lattice in the backlastly I got this bra so I showed youguys another one that I got in astraight version of this in my breastaugmentation video so this is the samebras up in black and I really like howthese straps are gray I've never seenthat before can I really like the detailon the back so that's it for foreveryone so now it's move on to me oneat the exciting part and when I wentshopping at Lululemon it was actually atax free day and it was at the aftermathof Black Friday so there's a lot ofreally good sales going on so I got alot of stuff looting not one not two butthree pairs of the zonin crop first Igot them in blue and I just kind of

it's christina marie from very easymakeup and today i wanted to doa review of a lululemon tennis skirtdupe um so this is the lululemon tennisskirt um it's actually pretty old i'vehad this for a year nowthis is the lululemon play off thepleatsskirt and the dupe that i bought onamazonfor a fourth the price is buythe tags are still on it crazy yoga itis also a pleated tennis skirtit's a little bit different than thelululemon tennis skirt but it has a lotof similaritiesso i wanted to do a review of theplayoff the pleats tennis skirtby lululemon and then compare it to thislululemontennis skirt dupe for much much cheaperum so what are the characteristics ofthe lululemon play off the tennis plateskirtum it has a couple of things it has apocket in the front for your keyslet me see if i can show it here this isthe frontit hides right in hereso fits your keys really really nicelyit has a string around the waist to makeit tighterit has good pleats on the side and thenwhy a lot of women love this skirt is ithas the gripperson the bottom of it and it has twopocketson both sides so those are some of thecharacteristics of the lululemonplay off the pleats tennis skirtum i've had this skirt for over a yearnow i wear it basicallytwo times a week at least in the summertime for runningit's held up really really well as youcan see the pleats are still verynoticeable on this tennis skirtand i throw this lululemon tennis skirtin the wash and the dryerand it's held up very very well soi actually love this tennis skirt umi'll admit i actually don't like it fortennis this is just me personallyi find it a pain to stick the tennisballs in the pocketi prefer the tennis skirts for actualtenniswithout the grippers where you juststick the tennis ball under the skirtbut anyway this is the lululemon playoff the pleats tennis skirtnow the crazy yoga tennis skirt isactuallyreally really similar um it also has thestringin the middle and it has pockets in thefrontthey're basically copying the lululemontennis skirt umexcept they're charging 20 versus like ahundredum it has a very similar frontas well it has the grippers on thebottomof this tennis skirt it has pocketson both sides it has a zipperin the back for other stuff and it alsohaspleats in the back now these two tennisskirts areactually different it's not a true dupeof the lululemon tennis skirtum and here's why a couple ofdifferences main onethe lululemon tennis skirt has pleats onthe sidethis tennis skirt by crazy yoga haspleatson the back so that's difference numberonefrom the front view as you can seethis tennis skirt by crazy yoga hasstitching on the side and the lululemononealso has stitching but it's actually iwas hoping thatthis one would be better quality thestitching on the lululemonis a lot more subtle um i think it'sjustbetter quality honestly of stitching theoneon the crazy yoga stitching is a lotthicker it's more noticeable umfrom the gripper perspective the crazyyoga grippers are actuallya little bit thinner and i can tellthey're not as strongas the lululemon grippers on the bottomand i've had this for a year and this isbrand new umso you do kind of get what you pay forthe lululemon tennis skirt is slightlyhigher quality in that regardfor the stitching around the waistbandof the two tennis skirtsum they're about similarum they both have the stitching veryvery welldone they look the same aroundthe waist and i think at the bottomlooking at it this is the crazy dogstitchingthe lululemon one is definitely betterit's more refined so from a very verydetailed perspectivei think the lululemon skirt is bettermadeto be honest also in the back it hastwo layers of material which i think iskind of cutewhereas this crazy yoga one just has thedifferent back and it has one layer andas you can tellthe stitching is still good but it'snot the same quality as the lululemonstitching unfortunatelyum i actually really love elijah tennisskirts and another brand calledkyogen um but this is a goodoverall lululemon tennis skirt dupeum it's about twenty dollars on amazoni'll include a link belowwhereas this one the play off the pleatstennis skirt by lululemon they sadlydon't make it anymore and when i did buyit at full priceit was like 98 maybe 80 but it wasexpensiveso what i'm gonna do now is i'm going totry on thiscrazy yoga tennis skirt thatis known for being the lululemon dupeandgive you my honest opinion of this skirtthisis the lululemon tennis skirt dupe onamazoni'll show you it below this is by crazyyogaum so as you can see there it's prettyshortbut tennis skirts are always shortthat's justhow they're made um the grippers aroundthe thighsi will admit i actually like this morethan the lululemon tennis skirtum it's not as tight and i have prettymuscular thighsthis tennis skirt by crazy yoga is asize small so it's more comfortablei will say putting it on right away thenthe lululemon play off thetennis pleats skirt um the pocketslet's test it out when i go running ialways have my cell phone in knit onepocketmy credit card mask whatever in anotherthe pocket itself is still very goodum i didn't mention this earlier thepockets on the lululemon skirt are alittle bit biggerbut not worth mentioning um so the skirtpocket is very good as you can see thepleats are cute umit looks nice i like the stitching onthe side like thisit's very flattering it kind of goes outa little bitit can be tight underneath it doesn'tlook tight onand overall it's cute i think for mepersonally it's a little bitloose at the waist but that's the samein on the lululemon startso um you can just tighten it no problemand tada that is the crazy yogatennis skirt which is a dupe um againthis is asize small on amazon and i'll post alink belowso now what i'm gonna do is show you thelululemon skirtum so you can see whether this one'sactually a dupe or notso this is the lululemon play off thepleats tennis skirtum when i first put it on i could tellit flares outa little bit more at the thighs orupper thighs whatever you want to callit but other than thatit looks pretty much the same the backof course is different as mentionedbut they're both pleated tennis skirtsand they're both really really cuteagain you have the pocket on one sidepocket on the other sideyou have a small pocket in the middlehere for your keysand then a pocket in the back which ipersonallynever use um so in summary the crazyyoga tennis skirt is a pretty good dupeof the lulu tennis skirtum they're both about the same in myopinion they're slightly differentstyles butboth really good the stitching on thelululemon tennis skirtis better but who's gonna notice andanalyze the tennis skirt that close upso please subscribe to my channelon one of these sides and links to bothtennis skirts arebelow i'll be honest it's going to behard to find the lululemon playoffthe pleats tennis skirt you're going tohave to look on poshmarkwhereas the crazy yoga tennis skirt youcan buy on amazontoday for only 20 bucks um anywaygood luck shopping happy spring andlet me know your comments thoughts belowif you want me to review anything elseor have other athletic gear that youlove now that it's spring i basicallylive in athletic clothes all the timethanks guys,22,UCtfIIesdkm5p4HiSZ1Q9bbg,Very Easy Makeup,2,0,0,15,"['Lululemon tennis skirt', 'Lululemon play off the pleats tennis skirt',

pantsdon't worry I'll try everything on soyou can kind of see how it fits and I'm5 foot 9 for those of you wondering sothese are the wonder under roll downs Ican personally go in a 6 or a 4 in thesethese ones I always rip the tags offbecause they always bug me but I thinkthese ones are a size 6 so I got theseand they're really really soft andstretchy and I love the pattern it'slike such a pretty floral print and thenthese ones you can wear high-waisted orroll them down kind of more like yogapants style so if you ate a lot where ami wasted and they'll suck you inotherwise you can roll them down andthey look really cute too and then inthe back they have like the little itprobably can't even see it but they havea little Lululemon in here and there andI just reallylove these pants all right the next pairof pants I got was in Californiaactually I got these ones in Portlandright when I got back but though thesame exact style of pant like the hothigh-waisted ones but these ones aresize 4 so they're a little more snug onme what's actually alike they're in thiseggplant maroon II purpley color andthen they have the Lululemon there andthen when you roll it down it has on theother side as well so I got these pantsand then I had gotten this sports brathat's the exact same colorum oh crap I forgot what this is calledI think this is the free to be wildsports bra you'll see what it looks likeon and I'll put everything in thedescription I'll link as many of thesethings as I can find they're still onthe website but this is basically itit's a shorter like sports bra this wayand then my energy one so it doesn'tcover as much about Li how many can youcover so that's not a huge issue for meand then the back is super coat I likethese ones because as you you'll be ableto see in the video when you wear likeracerbacktanks it kind of pokes out and then alsoyou have like this really cute like thinband at the bottom and then you have thelittle Lululemon on the corner and yeahthere's worth those are really amazingquality I can't stand sports bras thatlike dig in or cut or just like I don'tknow like I just I'm really obsessedwith this or super bra and it matchesthose pants all right so we're going tomove on to what I got for my birthdaylet's start with a big oneMichael got me this bag I've beenwanting and I really glad you did it'son the website price in a store anymoreat least of the one we went to sowrinkled frumpy the bag it's huge youguys this is it it's like a giant duffeland I saved the tag since I just got ityesterday this is the sweat and go bagso I really love this color I think thatin the fall time it'll be really prettywith some maroon type clothing andand the summertime is perfect it's anice light color and it's got the rosegold blue the lemon right here and ithas like a pocket here a little zipperpocket here and then you open the top ofit and it says sweat it and forget it ithas like a little like bathing suitbaggy in here it comes with another likelittle baggy inside it's got pockets andthen it's got like a perfect pocket bikehere that I like to put my laptop in soyeah if you guys want like what's in mygym slash person but a video let me knowbecause this is my new favorite it'sgood for like going to the gym goingovernight places I stay at hotels likeonce a week with Michael for his job sothat is perfect so he got me a Michaelalso got me these shorts I don't haveany workout shorts because I'm not a biglike shorts persons I'm usually supersuper pale but now that I've beenself-tanning I really wanted theseLululemon shorts so these are the UMwhat the sport short and I love thislike stripy pattern they have like coolpockets on the side there are pretty bigpockets too and then they say lululemonathletica on the band and then they havelike a little Lululemon and being righthere and then on the inside they havelike a little pocket and then they alsohave a drawstring so you can make surethat they're fitting properly and thenthese ones are a 4 inch inseam sothey're a little bit longer soespecially people like me are reallytall and have long long legs these areperfect because they're not superhoochie short so owen other-- storyMichael had to order these fromAustralia from a place called stylerunner because they don't have thispattern on the website anymore so if youare looking for these go to style runnercalm and that's where Michael got minethe next few things I got I boughtmyself for my birthdayhow cute right now the first thing Iknew I just wanted to get a plane likeone of these tanks thisis the swiftly racerback and I like ityou probably can't see I don't know butit has kind of like the Lululemonembossed into the fabric and then italso has a little sign up here and thenit's got um like little patterns maybeyou'll be able to see it better when Itry it on this I'm not gonna lie to youthis is a size 2 which is weirdsomewhere on my throat I'm over 6 in thesports bras yeah so this is $48this is like a paper-thin tank top so ifany of you understand why this specifictank top is $50 please let me knowbecause I have a no freaking clue thenext tank top I got I kind of understandwhy it's more expensive and you'll seewhen I try it on what it looks likereally because it looks kind of grosslike this but it's this really cool armygreen kind of heathered and it's gotlike a super high weird neckline I'venever seen any shirt like this beforeespecially not a workout shirt but Ilove it it like covers up here so ifyou're like bending over to lift weightsup or like doing anything like thatnothing is going to show not that I haveanything to show but then the back dipslow so if you wear any of those coolsports bras they'll still show and ithas like ventilation all over it likeyou can't really tell but the way thefabric is placed like it's gonna bereally Airy so if you sweat and it's allscrunched on the side so it hugs you andstays on your body it doesn't like rideup on you and then it's got the littlewound women in the corner this is theend the flow tank and this was fifty twodollars but the quality of this one ismuch better feeling to me personallythan the other one I mean I love it theminty color is really pretty and it'spretty but this one is like really wellmade and I understand why it costs whatit does so this one I definitelyrecommend if you want something a littledifferent it's definitely going to be apiece that not a lot of people will havethere's only like two in this store nextpurchase is going to look really strangewhen I hold it up you see which way itgoes so I got these pants that looksuper weirdand these are the in the flow crop - andI usually don't wear crop leggings tothe gym but I figured since it's gettingwarm outside and summery like I shouldget some things that are not justfooling fans I really like wearing fulllike pants I don't know why I just dobut these when you put them on this partlooks more normal but this fabric islike it's nothing I've ever felt beforelike this is the absolute thick as italmost feels like a thick sweater Idon't know like it's just like the supersuper thick fabric and then thewrenching on the sides and I mean I'veheard how am i see people wear thesepants I picture them being really thinmaterial but no this is friggin thickand then it's kind of got the Lululemonembossed like in a big circular thing onthe buns then you've got the little logohere and then the actual pattern ofthese I don't know if you can tell butit's like a chevron II type pattern so Ireally like these and these were 88which you know right so last thing fromLululemon is gonna be these high x panor perfect length for short people likethe perfect full length for short peoplebut for people like me who have reallyreally long legs these are gonna be inbetween a crop and a full pan so kind oflike an ankle pant which is kind of funbecause I don't have anything like thatand they're high-waisted they come rightto my belly button and then they're thiscool pattern and then they have thisreally cool like black detailing on themthese aren't really like the roll downones but I guess you could but these aremore like they fit perfect perfectthey're not as high-waisted as thehigh-waisted ones but they are stillhigh waisted so they've got it's justreally cool pattern on them and then Ijust really liked this like cutoutdetail and then it's black like I knowlosing them and makes them with meshcutouts too but I really like the blackone I think it looks a little lessscandalous for the gym the last twothings I got I ordered from gym sharkwhen they weren't out of stock I alwayshave a stock of everything likeseriously like I don't understand how acompany does well when they literallyarestop all the time but that does not stopme from stocking their website 24/7waiting for something to show up anywayI got thisJim shark seamless tank top I think theystill have this in stock it has thelittle Jim shark logo the quality ofthis top is amazing it says Jim charwritten on this side it's super thin butsuper super soft and sweat wicking andit fits like a glove and I absolutelylove it I wasn't expecting to like thisshirt that much but I do in the color isjust like something and then I got theoh crap are these the Flex legging I'lllink them below if I can find them but Igot these leggings when they launchedand I love them the Jim shark legginghype is definitely worth the height Icannot wait until they get their otherones in stock actually checked thismorning and the ambition leggings areback in stock but they don't have extrasmall so I'm gonna wait but when theyget more the leggings back in stock I'mdefinitely going to order everything butthese ones have the blue band thatmatches the shirt and it says Jim sharkand then these are a material I've neverexperienced before like it's not whatyou would think you just have to trythem when they're in stock but they havelike this weird ruching at the back ofthe knee here and it just kind of helpsthem form to your leg it's really niceand thick but it's like breathable soyour knee doesn't get all crunched upand then here at the ankle it has a nicelittle stripy detail and these um are alower rise and they definitely make thebutt a look nice so I am loving my Jimshark stuff I cannot wait to get moreand then that was only at Lululemonstuff and you've been to Lululemon youknow that that is a lot of stuff forthat store because everything is reallyreally bringing expensive but I wasfortunate enough to kind of gather thosethings all I really wear on a day-to-daybasis isand workout clothes not all women butworkout clothes so I felt it better toinvest in things like that versus justbuy a bunch of clothes that are justgonna go sit in my closet alright

[Music]hey guys say and welcome back to mychannel so we normally talk aboutlegging dupes on this channel but youknow I am open to all active or dupesand recently for Christmas I got aQueenie Keith jacket from my mom and itis very very similar to the Lululemon tofind jacket and I hat so I obviouslyhave a little undefined jacket I hadthis from like years agoum and the Queenie key jacket is just socomparable to the actual Lululemondefined jacket and you save a lot ofmoney so I just wanted to go over likemy comparison points on these and if Ithink it's worth it to get this one orif I think the little mo jackets worthit so stay tuned so first of allcomparing price the Queenie key jacketis an AM song so you do have AmazonPrime there and it's only 1499 so that's40 dollars 99 centsso while that is a little more expensivethan like Queenie Keys normal stufffirst of all this does have like reallygood construction in it and this is avery nicely made but second of all ofthe Lululemon define jacket is 148dollars so you were saving over $100 ona jacket which that's just a lot ofmoney for a jacket like I know who thelovin has like super high prices butpeople keep buying like it's reallycrazy like I'm not actually the biggestmove alignment fan I feel like a lot ofgood fabrics it'll very easily and Idon't love that but this is a super nicejacket with a lot of cool features but148 dollars is a lot of money so thisone is only 40 dollars so the Lululemondefine jacket I bet they make it inmultiple fabrics but the one that theylisted online was their luan fabric myfabric is like a little differentbecause I have like this kind oftextured color but it definitely doeshave like a few pills you know that itis like kind of like a more cotton IIfeel and luan if you didn't know is likea nylon like red blend the Queen ikijacket is made of either a polyesterspandex or nylon spandex depending onthe fabricI'm not exactly sure which one this isso this is the nylon spandex blend andit definitely feels like it's lesscotton II but it's not that like shinyslick compression material but itdoesn't feel like it'll get pills andI'm really good at telling if things aregonna get pills because I hate to feellike nothing else so I really don't seethis getting pills at all but this noteis definitely a different textureanother very important aspect of aLululemon jacket are the thumb holes Ilove a good jacket with thumb holes Ijust feel like it really keeps it overyour hands very nicely so we see righthere Billu I'm gonna find jacket it'sgot foam holes and the Queen iki jacketalso has some holes so they did a reallygood job of copying the little detailsbut yeah there's stumble there's alittle thumb hole right here the Queeniki jacket - so you're not losing thatfeature and the fold-over cuffs or as Ilike to call them hand pockets but yesthe Lululemon ones have these littlefold-over cuffs they call them somethingspecial but it keeps your hands warmlike if you're running and it's coldwhich i think is such a good ideabecause like why would your arms be coldbut not your hands you knowso the Lululemon one has that and sodoes the Queen iki jacket so you'reagain getting that future I think thisis such a nice feature and it's like sonicely made on both the Lululemon andthe Queenie key they also both have backventilation so by back ventilation Imean there's this like top piece offabric this is the coop this isobviously a little em'ly jacket the toppiece of fabric and then it has thislittle mesh insert almost actually it'slike open here I think so if you getlike too hot while you're running that'ssupposed to like be a bench to kind ofcool off and the Queen Kida it has thesame thing it's okay it's similar on theQueenie key the Queenie key isn'tcompletely open it just is a full meshbut it does have to say back ventilationas you can see right there it also has avery similar logo if you couldn't tellbut the Queenie key logos likeokay thank you and mesh insert so nokeep you warm when you're like Cola butit also when you get a little sweatyit'll also keep you very coolthey both have nice little zip pocketsas you can see the zip construction isvery nice and I love zip pockets becauseI don't trust regular pockets that arelike kind of like horizontal becausethings will just fall out of them if I'mgonna keep like valuable like keys orsomething in there I want it to use itso they also have the zip pockets andthe kind of like inside pocket on thethis is the Queenie key they do havethat like inner pockets on the inside ofyour jacket if you wanted to tucksomething into this little pocket theyhave that and they also have that on theLululemon so the sizing is a littledifferent the Lululemon I believe I havea size six in mine but and it justdefinitely feels a little tighter thanmy kini key one but my queen ek one isalso a medium and I think of four to sixit's like a small so this doesn't makesense that this one would feel a littletighter a Lululemon Devine jacket comesin size 2 to 12 at least that's what itsays on their website currently maybethey have more sizes but that's what thewebsite says clean ki carry sizes extraextra small to extra extra large so bothbrands are very size inclusive and havea lot of different sizes and youdefinitely wouldn't like I mean thiscomes up to extra extra large so theyhave definitely have a large size rangefor the Queen Ikki which is great sothis is the Lululemon define jacket asyou can see it has this nice likecontouring detail this is kind of likethe shape of their logo and also addslike I don't know it feels like it'svery likeflattering to the body and thisdefinitely feels a bit luxurious jacketI definitely like that about it it'svery I mean this is a size six and I'dsay it's definitely tight on the chestarea but it gives me a little more spaceat the bottom the zippers feel a verygood quality obviously this extensivebetter beat quality as you can see thelittle little Lululemon logos rightthere actually part of my little zipperthing broke off like a while ago butthat you can't really you can't reallytelland yeah here are the hand pockets inaction and love these and yeah this isjust no no this is just the trying onportion but yeah this is just a greatvery luxurious jacket obviously noproblem stuff it also the inside of thepockets are lined look like a mesh aswell so so here is the Queenie keyjacket I do have to say this is stillpretty soft to the the Lululemon jacketis just like such a nice the fabric isjust so nice and like so soft andluxurious but like that's kind of aLululemon thing but yeah but I mean thisone is still very very nice it is moreof a match so this is like a charcoalgray and it definitely is more matteit's not like shiny like some of thephotos on the on Amazon looked a littleshiny and they do have a similar littlelike contouring detail as you can seebut it's not like as abrupt this is moreof a lining and the other one was likelike darkened but I think that this ishow the plate color Lululemon ones looklike they do have a very similar littlezipper right here instead of theLululemon logo obviously it's like theQueenie key but it's definitely likealmost exactly the same as the Lululemonone collar also very similar this thisis a medium and it feels slightly largerthan the Lululemon size six but it'sstill like somewhat tight on the chestIV and I have a little more space downhere but it actually say this one's alittle more fitted overall in terms oflike the actual sizing but yeah it's socute yeah still have the thumb holes andhand pockets and everything yeaheverything about this feels veryhigh-quality Queenie key definitelydoesn't excellent job with their qualityI've done a fewuse for them for and I just really likethis stuff I love their leggings they Imean people think that their Lululemonon me all the time like they asked melike oh I like your Lulu's like they'renot but you thought so you know but yeahthis jacket is definitely an excellentdupe for the the Lululemon definedjacket I don't think anyone would evenknow this and then lessor like a littlelemon like clone sewer you know likesome people are so yeah overall Idefinitely say that the quality whilethe Lululemon just feels a little moreluxurious than the Queenie key theQueenie key does feel very high qualityI mean 40 dollars for a jacket is stilla decent amount but I just think thatyou really are this really is a greatinvestment especially if you really loveLululemon and can't afford like multiple$150 jackets this is such a greatalternative it has all basically all ofthe same features that the definedjacket has you're not gonna missus handpockets back ventilation zip pocketsthumb holes all of it I think that it'ssuch a great jacket and I would say thatit does run pretty true to size like Ioften get mediums and tops so this and Igot a medium in this and I have nocomplaints about the fit the sleevelength is good on me and I have longarms so yeah I hope you guys find foundthis video helpful I think this wouldmake a great gift for someone like I gotit as a gift and I think it's just likeit like it's a little easier to buy foras a gift but like a pair of leggingsyeah you guys enjoyed this video and Iwill see you next time bye[Music],26,UCqOC1SiA6v994Sx_WR1-xew,Kathryn

super sporty it has thelittle tassels at the neck kind of foldsover and yeah has pockets and I love itso the next item is these what is thebrand the brand is intro love the fitbut I just like them because they'rejust some little joggers but they have alittle twist on them because they havetheir I like the printit's a herringbone print and then it hasa white I mean a black tuxedo kind ofstripe down the side it kind of makes itlook like ants pockets but they don'thave pockets just fake pocket but anywayjust a little joggers to throw on or asporty day and I am just like reallygetting to the point where I'm trying tothrow things that I'm gonna wear on adaily basis but this channel Iabsolutely love dressing up for you guysand showing different styles differenttypes of styles I'm really

like avintage pair of pants they're David dartsport but they gave me the same feel asthe previous ones and these are blue andthey have like black running throughthem and the ankles on these arethey come in a little bit and so theseare just as a sporty pair of hands towear these actually do have pockets sothat's good and yeah okay so the nextitem are these and Taylor businessslacks and they're a nice like kind ofgrayish brown brownyeah grayish brown color so I reallyneeded some more business pants becausea couple pair that I had didn't fitanymore they were too big and so yeahthese are gonna come in really nicely orreally handy when I have to actuallydress in them like typical business wayI don't lately don't dress in a typicalbusiness way when I wear businessclothes but you know sometimes there'snot everybody that you depending on whattype of meeting you go to you have todress a certain way so you know I'llgladly do that when I need to otherwiseI'm going to definitely show my stylebut anyway the next pair are these pantsfrom casual corner annex and only thingabout these I've been wanting some whiteslacks but I've been seeing them onInstagram Pinterest and I wanted ifeveryone wasn't appear for a while butlike every pair get they're kind ofsee-through and these are no exceptionso I don't know if you guys have somesuggestions or how to maybe I don't knowmaybe I wear some shorts underneath butit's summertime you wear white you knowpants in the summer because you don'twant to be hot so I don't know if youguys have any suggestions of how to wearhow I can wear these are not showeverything that's underneath them let meknow in the comment section okay so thisnext item actually made me laugh atmyself a little bit I was in the line toleave to check out and I saw this cutelittle red jacket and I thought like wowyou know that's cute a quarter you knowI can't beat that of course and it'sfrom Land's in it has a nice little flatflat liningand I thought it was just cute and so Itried it on like Oh three-quarter lengthsleeves that's interesting on a jacketbut you know I have long arms so I'mnothing really fits me anyway so I'mlike okay I didn't think anything of itthen I put the hood on and I said huhthat hood is kind of small but you knowI'm not good anyway so then I came homeand I looked at the tag and I'm likethat's a little boys jacket which mayeverything makes sense all of a suddenso you know whatever but I still like itand fourth quarter you know I can't beatme you know just needing a jacket to runout of the house and that'll be greatso the next item was really exciting Iwas trying on my stuff and they havelike a two-way mirror so it's not reallya mirror but you can see yourself in itand I was trying my stuff on and a ladywas standing next to me trying on herstuff too and she tried on this sweaterand she said I didn't understand whatshe said but she just gave it to me sayhey try this I'm like okay and so shewas like I don't know which way it goeswhat's the top and what's the bottom andhonestly she was right you can't reallytell what the top or the bottom is ofthis sweater but and it has like a linegoing down the bottom but and has notags on the inside of it but I tried iton and I looked at the sleep I saw thatand I like that Lululemon I'm like welleven if it's not if even if it's aknockoff then you know it's only aquarter so I was excited I wasn'texciting and fine but it has no tags andI couldn't find whether they actuallymade this sweater at any point in timebecause who knows how long ago thissweater is from but it has the holes inthe sleeve in the yeah and the sleeveand so it's a really cute sweater ifit's like weird but weird in a nice waynot weird in a weird wayno not weird in a bad way so yeah so Ithought that was really cool a reallyreally awesome fine and in the next itemare some a trend that I haven't triedyet so I'm excited to try it and theyare overalls and I'm gonna say I haven'ttried it yet cuz obviously there was atime that I did wear overalls but thatwas middle school and this is now so Ifound these Bugle Boy and they arereally cool I think they're really coolthe only thing is is that one of the Ididn't realize this until I got home oneof these is broken but you know I'lljust wear one up and one down you knowand so it has a really cool Bugle Boysymbol on the back on the back of thepocket and so yeah I thought that thatwas something that I can try like I keepsaying for a quarter I mean why not tryit okay so the next two items are I havean obsession with jacket so you'vealready seen two jackets I mean justregular jackets but even more so withBlazers one I'm always cold - I justlove to layer I love to layer so thenext item I found is a vintage this isDonna Morgan duster and so I'll try tohold it up it's pretty longand it doesn't dust the floor actuallywith me it comes down about me at calfmini--lengthbut I just thought that this was kind oflike a really cool jacket I'll shoot seeif you see like it has pockets on thefront and it's just a really cool I justthought it was a really cool jacket Imean it just is a really cool jacketblack jacket you can't go wrong and thenlastly in that portion or for that storeI found this Casper jacket and this isvery vintage you can see like the thestructure of these shoulder pads arelike off the chain for real and but Ireally like how this comes down thelapel comes down into these blackbuttons and then it has these pockets onthe side and then in the back it has thebig black buttons on that and I thoughtabout like taking the sleeves off I'vebeen doing that to everything soprobably leave the sleeves on and you'llsee you guys see how I style it ofcourse their sleeves are not long enoughnothing ever is but I just thought Ilove this color blue this actually usedto be my favorite color to wear growingup and so I still love it of course andbefore I became a green junkie but um soI love that color and I am reallyexcited to style it okay so this is whatI found first of all another jacket andI just thought this was cute I wouldprobably end up doing something so it'skind of why I just feel like it fitsreally wide on me but anywaywhat the tag says tag says pottery but Ithink it's supposed to fit why but it'sa denim quilted jacket and has adrawstring at the bottom and so I justthought I mean four-quarter why notexperiment with it so that's that then Ihave a pair of jeans and these areanother Gloria Vanderbilt pair of jeansand I just wanted these because my otherboyfriend jeans or distressed jeans orwhatever I ripped them so I just wantedanother another pair that I could stressso those will be in my distressing pileand then I got another pair of thosestretchy mom jeans because I sawsomebody do one with patches and Iwanted to do one with patches so thesewill be getting kind of bleached andpatched and whatnot oh then I saw thist-shirt and I couldn't pass this t-shirtup um and I'm not gonna tell you why butyou know guess so it's just somebody'sworkout tee and it says Nike Air it'salready cut around the neck so it's justsomething to wear when you're just aboutto run around and do whatever and itsays maintaining air maintaining airsuperiority 679 so I said it was meantfor me I'm not gonna tell you why but itwas meant for me and so I got fat andthen something else that was just youknow something to play around with Idon't know that I'll necessarily wear itor use it to make something else I don'tknow I don't know but I got a footballjersey and this is like the cropand I like outfits but I'm not sure I'mnot sure if I could pull this off I'llstyle it for you guys and you seewhether I actually am boy if you see itin the lookbook then you'll know whetherI was able to pull it off or not andthen I found this Liz Claiborne whitewith black polka dot shirt and I don'thave a polka dot blouse and so I kind ofthought that this was a classic thing tohave and and I'm really excited that Ifound that that was really you know kindof like a staple piece to find and thena really cool find was this vintageDiane von Furstenberg blouse and it haslike a little stand up collar and thenthe button the buttons don't start untillike down here and it has cut where'sthe buttons it has covered buttons so ofcourse it's vintage and yeah it's like ataupe kind of like a taupe gray taupecolor so that was a really really coolfind and then I found another littleboys little boys jacket and this one isreally cool nice and utilitarian and letme see what's the brand on this one epicthree it's and I knew it was a littleboy jacket because it says size 10 butit's not it doesn't fit on me like asize 10 and you know kind of fits and soit's just a black jacket and it hascamel on the inside and they put on theback it has a tiger woven on the backreally kind of big on the back so Ithought that was really cool and Ireally liked to mixlike the idea of hard and soft and so Iwould probably something thisutilitarian I would probably style itwith something like really like a staplepiece something really classic and youknow kind of breaks it up kind of breaksup the stuffiness of it for me so yeahso to end this haul I actually forgotabout these two pieces I went my husbandfinally let me take him to the thriftstore because he needed some new jeanshe hates shopping and he was not intothe fact that I when I first startedthrifting he's coming aroundovertime when he's seen the stuff thatI've been able to get but so he finallylet me take him and so of course I'm notleaving without some other stuff sothese actually were not accorded we wenton 75 no we went on one dollar day sothis is just a shirt that I'm going tolike cut up I'll probably you know justcut it down and make it one of those lowside tanks and it says Paris ParisUniversity so I thought that was cutejust to wear with some jeans and thenthe last item are some more but theseare like like kind of loped like thosereally light material and these arethose stretchy jogger jeans with timein the front pockets I thought thatthose were cute and this brand iscrystal crystal apparel yep so that isit for that

sweatshirt butit's a sweater and that was a small sothe next time i think i would probablyget a medium I don't know it was kind ofnice that it was fitted but it was fromthe gap and they have lots of goodcolors including that really brightpaint which would probably the next onethat I got and then several of you ifyou'll notice our Christmas tree isstill in process um John usuallydecorates the very tip-top because evenwith me with my little grabber that weuse and my stool I couldn't geteverything up there and last night weevery night we've been shipping say lastnight we shipped until late and I wecouldn't get to it but he does have thatthing that you guys were talking aboutthat you get at home depot that is likethe lightkeeper I think he bought thatlast year and we cannot find it so thatreally led to the Clark Griswold thinggoing on because he was so frustratedthat he couldn't find it and then hewent to lowes and home depot and theywere sold out so by that time he was sodetermined I mean he just had that crazylook in his eye and he just replaced allkinds of fuses and bulbs and thenyesterday when I was going through Ifound the little pack of fuses and bulbsthat came with it he had gone and boughtmore he had even bought lights and wastaken off the lights he was just youknow going nuts but I told him what yousaid last night he said that's what Ihad that's what I can't find so anywaybut we're going to deal with it I thinkthere was just a few out and so it stillit looks good we have a few I haven'tput the actual bulbs on there yet but welove it it lights up the whole room andlet's see Rachel k I still have some andI've ordered some more today I've hadseveral of you ask me does it work foroily skin and the answer is yes it workswonderful matter of fact I would gear itmore you know for oily normal to oilyskin than I would for dry if you did dryit would be good with maybe a liquid ora moisturizing foundation over it butit's wonderful for all the skin that'swhat i have is ole et zone then I had abunch of questions about the brighteningpowder from Bobbi Brown I use that as afinishing powder it doesn't have anyshimmer or any Sparkle I really don'tknow even I guess it's just all thecolors combined what brightens is justit evens out your skin tone it iswonderful and it does not even I've hadpeople ask me you know was it like theslaw right spotlight or anything it'snot like that at all it does not takethe place of a highlighter it takes theplace of your finishing powder and thensomeone asked me what was the differencein that and the laura mercier with thelaura mercier is more of like afoundation powder it's to give coverageand it leaves more of a luminous finishthe brightening powder would be go overthat especially like me after I spraywith the pics + then I go over with thelet me back up and maybe you can see mymakeup better yeah then you can on yougo over it with that Bobby Brown and itjust helps you know finish it and let'ssee I just want to get questions thesame questions over and over I try tojust maybe answer them in a video so ican get everybody's hmm what are some ofthe other ones that i had a lot of youcommented about you know we're in somuch makeup and that tutorial just itwas just a made-up look like today ismore of probably my everyday i just haveon Bobby Brown taupe and Lancome drapeand our lashes are just they're justsimply easier I mean I would ratherspend the time putting these eyelasheson than my scary any day and then when igo to take my makeup off at night it'sjust take this off

okaysnatch snatch snatch right I pretty muchgrabbed all the colors there was in mysize and they were all on sale and thenI proceeded to you know go try it on sothen I guess I'll show you what I got Ihope you know that would help right sothen so I got these pants and they'recalled the zone in crop and they this isthe purple color I love this this islike a kind of like a blush pink purpleI guess

god so I got these pants there arethose Onan crops and I'm not gonna readlike what its size but basically umthese are like well I'll kinda read whatit says because I don't know what'sabout to explain it so these are theseamless seamless ones and they usestrategic strategically placed it seemsto provide the zone support and minimizedistractions which is so true and umthis is like a super thick fabric likeit's it has held in sensation it saysyeah it doesn't sound very right butthat's what it says held in sensationand yeah this material it's like sothick I think it's like one of thethickest materials that they have umit's kind of like scuba diving um yourmaterial like super spanic see butanyway so these are really good to likeas you can imagine to like suck you inand hold you in the right places andjust it's like Spanx I guess it's likeLululemon Spanx but yeah so then um yesI tried it on everything I loved it andwhat I loved was that it actually has umI'm so excited to explain this itactually has like uh so they I don'tknow if you can see they like sewed inthis area here like under the butt areaso it's so weird like when you try it onit just like pushes your butt up alittle bit more it's so weirdyeah I don't know it's kind of like alittle hidden seam band thingy that theysewed that lifts your bum just a littlebit more and it like seriously when Iwear these and I I do like day it's justlike and you have that booty pump whenyou do like day you know when you doyour booty day it's just my butt wasjust like whoait looked so good and I just love thesepads and like it wasn't just in my headyou know because I I've got a lot ofcompliments - when I whenever I wearthese pads that's basically what I haveto say about these pots they're just soawesome and they really like hold you inthe right places like more so than alltheir regular um you know style oflinkings like wonder unders or thehigh-rise ones and just oh these onesare not amazing and I don't know whythey're on sale like I asked a girl andshe was just like I don't know likethat's such a good price hey she evenagreed with me right so then I got um sooh yeah so anyways the sale price umcame off of these so these are size 4and they're regular a hundred andeighteen dollars Canadian and then thisis like the sale price think cap felloff so this is from the other one sothey were on sale for $39 like what asteal like that's why I did like aquadruple take when I seen this priceand I was like seriously like leggingsfrom Lululemon for $39 like it's unheardof you know like it's from especiallyfrom a hundred and eighteen dollarsthat's like oh you know that's likeprobably like almost a hundred percentoff no my math is so bad you know but umand I'm Chinese like go figure eight soyeah it's like a lot of percent off allI have to say and I was so happy when Iwhen I um no needs you know it was likethe the Lord was calling my name theangels were singing and I was like thankLord like it oh yeah the I went intoLulu at the right time at the rightplace the right day the right store andI was just like it was meant to be forme so then I picked okay back to realityso yeah I picked up these purple pairlove these I haven't worn these yet andI also got in the crop so like I wassaying these are the crop ones right andI find that the crop fits better on mebecause I'm shorter and I'm 5'4 I'm 5'4and it's just the crop stuff it's morelike leggings for me and I don't have toget them hemmed or anything and so likeI don't have to get them hemmed and youknow wait for them and it's because Iwhen I get my song I want to wear upright away or like the next day so Ihate when I have to have them pantsbecause you know I have to pick it up inlike two days and I just can't wait thatlongI just want patience for thatbut no really it's really not a big dealso yeah so the crop style fits meperfectly as pants and I love the cropstuff so I got the purple color and thenI also got this green color I love thiscolor tooI don't have anything like this in thiscolor and I just really really reallyreally like this so love it oh so ohthis is the back so yeah the Lulu logois right there on the back of the leftleg as always and I wore these alreadyso these are fresh out of the wall Ijust washed these and you line dry themright so these are like freshly linedried and then oh this is my otherfavorite pair well they're all myfavorites but the red pair so I got pairredand you know I always say I love brightcolors and whoever has been watching mylittle hauls that you know that I lovebright colors and like like how muchhappier can I be like Lulu likeLululemon hardly ever has like brightcolors and when they do it's just I'm sohappy and like yeah you look at thisright so there's those three in the cropand then um they also it also came in umlike the full pant leg length I guess soum these are just called the zone intights and they're the same it's justlonger like more of a pat one and theseones I kind of have to like roll likebunch up up at the bottom of my anklesbecause they're a little bit long or Ican fold them too if I wanted to Ihadn't worn these yet but I got it inthis like olive green color like armygreen olive green color I love thiscolor as wellandjust longer the longer version so thelaking version and yeah so these areregular $128 the laking ones and on salefor 39 to like I really cannot believeit's that cheap like I really cannot itjust blows my mind but it's good for meright so yeah these are all size foursand um it's a little bit tight but thenlike the like for my experience withLulu and from what the girl was sayinglike for seamless styles like they havemiss doll and then they have another oneit's like the m2 StreetPass style whereit's seamless you want to go a sizesmaller because they do stretch quite abit and my other two sheep leggings Leethey did stretch quite a bit and here Ithought I was just losing weight but itreally is the pant that's just stretcheda bit so that kind of like made me kindof sad but that's okay so yeah I wentwith a size 4 Lee I fit a size 6 toobecause I did try size 6 on but um I wastaking that into consideration that itwould stretch over time and you knowwhat I like squatting in these and likeyou know after grass and drop it likeit's hot and like die lifting and justlike stretching and stuff so obviouslythey're gonna stretch and it's shoe sobesides for fit me so much better andI'm so glad I went to size fours andsaid the six cuz I was gonna get the sixuntil the girl told me about it and Iwas like okay yeah so anyway too muchtalking and then I also got it in thischarcoal grey color I love this and Ihaven't worn these either so this is thelegging to like the full length pant andyeah same thing and in the dark grey notthis so like four five pairs of leggingsfrom Lululemon I paid like 40 times fiveso okay $200 plus tax and I think that'ssuch a good deal for five pairs oflittle leggings when regular price youknow it's a hundred it's over a hundreddollars each so um this would have beenlike one this would have been like sixhundred dollars almost cuz yeah theseare 128 and who's 118 each regular so Isaved like a gazillion dollars and mysoul is very happy that I saved all thismoneylike even if I didn't like them I wouldjust wear them like around a house orsomething for fun just because it's likeso cheap rightbut yeah I'm so happy I love these andthen I picked up one more pair of catsbecause like I've always wanted a bluepair of Lululemon's like I don't whyshould I do it I like never mind but umI just always wanted these like wonderunders like these came I've seen theselong long long time ago and when I wentback to get it it was gone and when Iseen these again like didn't you remakeof these I have to have them so they'rejust in the royal blue color and boththese are the Wonder under crop hi-riseand once againI love the crop I love crop because it'slike flowing for me I don't have to havethem done like I said so yeah these aresize fours and yeah the wonder underhigh rise so I like the high rise toobecause like it kind of like covers yourtummy and it just sucks your tummy in alittle bit more and yeah so the usualyou know wonder under pant I have reallynothing to say I love these pants andthey're so like stretchy and feels likeskin and I just love this new color Ilove it

so today's video is gonna be an updatedWest in my gym bag I now have to tunebags because I'm crazy like thatmy dog is making of appearance Culleytrying to say hi yeah wait there couldbe she's like so happy because I'mcurrently sitting on the floor I have todream bags I'm sitting on the floor justbeing real here and just so happy now Ilook closer look at that she can attackme tell so if you see her jumpingthrough the video she's just crazy likeI am but anyway the reason that I haveteaching bags is first of all becauseI'm a bigger crazy girl but the realreason is because I go to a gym prettyoften but I go for two different reasonsthe first one is if I'm going just for aquick workout under a couch or withtraining I usually go at the end of thework day I'm changing to my orchidclothes and I can buy food dress with mywork of clothes and I show at home mygym isn't close to my hood but it isn'tfar far away either and I much morerather have much lower back home thanthere and the other reason I go to thegym is if I want to spend like a goodtwo or three hours there on theenclosure with training then I'mchanging into my swimming suit I'm goingswimming or I'm going to the jacuzzi orto discerner that usually happens two tothree times a week but it means that I'mshowing there so I mean you know touriststuff and things like that and itrequires a bigger gym bag which is theone that I used to in my previous videobut we're gonna film an updated 1/3 Idon't think many things have changed butI really wanted to show you my new gymbag it is from my favorite workoutclothes and accessories brand which isLululemon you probably know likea bit of an obsession with lunamon Idiscovered the brand when I went to NewYork three years ago and ever since I'vebeen assessing over their clothes andaccessories because basically they arereally expensive but there are thehighest quality that you can find outthere each and every one of the productsis well thought it's beautiful they havegreat colors there I have likeridiculous on sports bra running shortsthings like that the materials are justincredible it's really breathable it'snot too hot or too cold and it's perfectand we need I believe that I have beencute workout gear makes a hugedifference at least it does for me mightbe silly but it will have motivates meif I have like huge running shoes and acute running jacket to put on top andreally having a good equipment is kindof compulsory if you're a runner and yourun outside because I live in Belgiumand it can be really so I have like arunning rain jacket it can be cool itcan be hot could be anythingso I love Luda and that was a bit of aramble about them but they recently likea year and a half launched a Europeanwebsite and ever since they did I'vebeen going bankrupt because I stalktheir website like crazy so I got thisbag because I really wanted a smallergym bag but I didn't want something toosmall or too big so I think this one Ifirst of all I love the color you cansee I have kind of an obsession it is abeautiful nylon pink with this realforest I don't know what the exactmaterial is a wrench part that goes intothe bottom as well and it opens reallywide it has some two long handles and alonger crisp 20 strap so it's reallypractical when you open it up it looks alittle something like this it has abeautiful grey lined interior and as youcan see it's fully open searchit's really really practical it hasthree pockets one is this one which isusually goes all the way to the bottomand on the other side of the bag then ifyou can tell by the harddrive a meshpocket and then it has this really greatpocket that is reinforced and padded toput your iPad in and I think this isactually great because this bag is aboutI will take with me on weekend getawaysgoing to the beach or something likethat and it's nice to have a paddedpocket to put your tech things in solet's get right into the bike the firstthing that I have here is a sports brafrom Lululemon as I told you about if anobsession I believe this one is calledthe free to view bra and it's justbeautiful the back of it it's justperfect if you're wearing like restoreback tank or a tank top it is beautifulthis is kind of a medium to high supportI read when I go to the gym where I gorunning it gives enough support to meand it is really really comfortable thenwe have it just dips a little lemon tanktop I believe this is called a runstrictly cool racerback tank and my dogattacks okay here we go back again so Ireally like this tub because it isreally lightsweetie soft really breath the ballbecause it has like this special meshthey need to learn to sweat to gothrough it looks beautiful paired withthe bra and I just love it because it'sreally long and really comfortable toexercise it then I have my croppedleggings got out from the minimun againwith the detailing on the bottom I loveit because it is blue and yellow so itgoes perfectly with the top and a Bravamost importantly these are really reallycomfortable and so easy to worry becausethey are black they're cropped I lovewearing cropped legging at the gym ithas a drawstring on the inside so youcan like I'm tight around your waist andit has a zipped pocket at the back toolocker key in or something like that soI love those then I have a cap Kidstonnickel bag again this is a bag I tookwith me if I'm showing back home so Idon't have any shower stuff in it but Ihave a bit Society there my because Ialways make sure to remove my makeupbefore working out because otherwise asyou can see I did in that for the pastweek and I'm breaking up like crazy andplus you don't want to sweat in yourmakeup then I have the Samba glamourshot for the eyes I have an eye creamwhich is Lexington icarian musk do yourbrightening correction not that becauseit has a metal tips it's really curlingon your eyes then I have the couldn t wedidn't and this I want to apply a bit onmy necks on my arms if my skin you feelstay dry and then I have this worksperfect skin super moisture which iskind of a serum and moisturizer in oneand I love that after the German that'severything fingers goodbye then I have ashoes bag that came with the bike it'sthe same pattern as inside of the bagand in it I had my workout cheese theseare the Nike lunar glide for in thiskind of acid yellow green color I reallylike these for working out and fromrunning because are really bouncy so thecracker can run for you and then on thebottom of the bag I have a towel and Ihave ninety Iran which is the mediaasset association 48 hours and thenthat's all I have in the Med pocketsalthough I still have how can I show youthat I still have my water bottle inthis mesh compartment this is just awater bottle that I got a primer andthen in the big bucket Ihave one thing which is lava suppose itwas a mine which is what I used torefresh my skin before and after I workout and I also use that on my color hairSun sorry because you need to wet thesensor and I have sensitive skin so Irather use that that tap water and thenin the mesh pockethere I have a few essentials I have atissueI have ers bleep bone in I mean if thisis mintsomething smells like mint and in hidethis cool tymberlee effect on your leftside we did like I have a pair ofhairpins is artem upper one and then Ihad a bunch of hair ties because Ialways forget to bring one with me somake sure to always have a couple in mybag and then I don't have anything intothe padded safe but the last thing Iwant to show you which i think is socool about base bag is that on this sideit has a hidden phone pocket so I canslide my phone right in there I can putmy gym membership in there and it'sprotected and easy to grab because Ihate when my phone rings inside of thebottom of my bag I need to dig throughit and I can never pick it up on time soI love this little pocket and that'severything for my small gym bag I knowthis is a bit obsessive to have teachingby but I thought

fosteringsustainable innovation strategies and Iam pleased to announce that BryanPeterson the director of innovation fromwhite space is joining us this afternoonso you may not know this but Bryanactually is a fellow SFU alumni andunfortunately he always got bettergrades than me so is a little bit bitterbut you know Bryan I won't hold itagainst you he's a disruptive thinkerand innovation and as the director ofinnovation at white space which isLululemon'sathletic 'as in-house innovation and R&Dteam Bryan is responsible for greatcreating the global retailers strategyfor executing high potentialgame-changing ideas please put yourhands together for Bryanthank you very much what a niceintroduction good afternoonhow's already doing good yeah goodexcellent so I'm here to talk to youabout how to actually develop and fostersuccessful innovation strategies withinyour own companies and we're gonna havethat conversation based on some of thework that we do at Lululemon and inparticular within the white space teambefore I get started how many peoplehere consider themselves to bepractitioners of innovation or work ininnovation how many of you would saythat you manage innovation teams in somecapacity R&D innovation teams okay greatso ideally there's going to be somegreat takeaways for you out of this talkand if you have any questions about someof the processes that we use you canalways reach out to me I'd be happy toas your emails or take a call so this iswhat we're gonna cover we're gonna talka bit about Lululemon not that we haveto really talk too much about it cuz Ithink we're all familiar with a companyand what we're doing we'll talk about myjourney into innovation how I actuallygot into innovation and innovationstrategy we'll talk about white spacewhich is the innovation R&D arm ofLululemon we'll talk a bit aboutinnovation and how we define innovationwithin our company and then talk aboutinnovation strategy from there we'lltalk about how we develop processes tomanage the innovation pipeline withinthe companywe'll talk about the importance ofleadership and culture and then I'lljust give you some thoughts that I haveabout innovation in general we're notgoing to cover innovation budgets we'renot going to cover the partnerships thatwe have underway within the team ourorganizational structure and we're notgoing to talk about any new projects onthe horizon so just it's good to knowwhat you're not going to get and that'swhat you're not gonna get so innovationokay so this is a lot about Lululemonbut what I really want to point out toto you is really the purpose in themission of the company so we say thatour purpose is to elevate the world frommediocrity to greatness and this hasalways been the Mishnah purpose of thecompany and that has a really big rolein how we talk about innovation and howwe value innovation within our companyour mission our products createtransformationalvariances for people to live happyhealthy and fun lives no matter what wedo from an innovation perspective wealways look back to our mission and ourpurpose to see if what we're creating isaligned and so from an innovationstrategy perspective grounding theconversation in a strong purpose and amission is really important for the workthat we do and basically creates areally grounding discussion for thebusiness as we look to implementconcepts to commercialization a littlebit with the company again financialsand storeswe're opening a lot of stores across theworld we're now one of our biggeststrategies is really aroundglobalization and expanding into theglobal marketswe're projected revenue this year of 1.8billion so we're doing well from acompany perspective and what's reallyimportant to know is this has nothing todo with the budgets that we have with aninnovation I'm not going to talkspecifics about budgets but I'll tellyou that we run lean as a team and thatis one of the key principles we'll talkabout in a while which is scarcity andscarcity is the mother of inventiona bit about my story so as you guysheard earlier I graduated from SFU Iworked for company info wave software mygood friend are here also worked therewith me together if that's kind ofinteresting to see you here and then Imoved to back east and worked for acompany called discrete logic which wasa company that worked in the area ofvisual effects software development sowe did gaming software and software forfeature film and television commercialpost-production we were acquired byAutodesk and it was at that time that Irealized how difficult it was to developsustainable innovation strategiesbecause none of those companiesaside from discrete for a very briefperiod of time could actually innovateconsistently so I went to McGill I didmy MBA and I focused on how do companiesactually create sustainable innovationand that was the work that I did duringmy MBA and it just so happened that whenI left my MBA there was an opening atLululemon to work within theirinnovation team and so I've been herefor about four yearsso that's my journey so white spacewhite space is the innovation teamwithin the product group at Lululemon soI would be remiss to say that we areresponsible for innovation becauseinnovation happens throughout theorganization our developers and ourdesigners are innovative our brandedcommunity team are innovative ourdigital and I team IT teams areextremely innovative so it's not that weown innovation within Lululemon it'sjust that we are able to exploreconcepts and ideas that typically sitoutside of what other teams areexploring that being said we have ahealthy R&D team as well that reallyfocus in on research like fundamentalresearch on product on human physiologyon all the things that we need to do tocreate really interesting products andexperiences for our guests and for thoseof you who don't understand losinglanguage guests are our customerswe're heavily invested in science inresearch and we have a little bit ofstrategy so this is typically how weoperate as a team we say that we createin two three years we talk about fiveyears and we dream about 10 years andthat's really how we manage ourinnovation pipeline so we'refundamentally focused on what to deliverin a short period of time but our eyesnever venture too far away from a10-year vision and we'll talk about howimportant that is in a minute we'regrowing fastwe started with three people four yearsago and now we're at 30 I should saythree years ago sorry and also key toknow we actually don't commercialize soour team is not responsible tocommercialize concepts we bring conceptsto proof of concept and we have to workwith our in line design and developmentteams to actually commercialize theideas that we have and this is hugelyimportant for the business and for thein line design and development teamswithin the company the reason being isnobody wants to receive a bomb fromanother team so we enroll our inlineteams early in the concepts that we workon and we do such a good job of thatthat by the end of the projectthose teams think the idea was theirsand that's how it works these are someshots of the whitespace workshop that isactually located on Cornwall so as youdrive drive by Cornwall Burrard you'llsee this big brick building with theLululemon logo on it it's not a massivestore that's our head office and at thebasement of that head office we have anine thousand square foot workshopfacility where we have everything thatallows us to do human performancetesting so we have in an inground poolwe have a large treadmill that you canride a bicycle on we have a climatechamber that typically we test coldweather product but in this particularcase we're just drinking beers in and wehave spaces where people can just meetand relax and create what I haven'tshown you here on the other side of theworkshop is we have a whole area thatallows us to actually create product sowe have every machine that our factoriesand our development partners across theseas have so that we can actuallydevelop the same product to spec thatwe're designing so we are able to inthis workshop do human performancetesting understand how our productsworked in context and then walk over toour sampling facility adjust productinvent product make new product based onwhat we're seeing from our guests andhow our guests is interacting with thosesolutions in terms of the structure ofour team really all you need to reallydo is focus on the gray area we actuallyhave three pillars within our team wehave innovation management we haveadvanced technology and we havescientific research I head up theinnovation management team which isreally responsible for understandingwhat problems in the world can we solveor that are we are uniquely qualified tosolve into the advanced technology teamsreally look for solutions to thoseproblems and the solutions could existwithin our vendor network or they mighthave to be developed and so we work withthe advanced technology team to reallyunderstand how we can solve innovativelyinto those problems and then beunderneath that we have a whole researchteam that is 100% focused on researchingso really understanding what thesynchros ease of the problems are thatwe're trying to solve into the spacesaround that team really represent theorganization so we work with design anda team called advanced concept we workwith the branded community team and theretail operations teams we work with theinline development and supply chainteams so what we say is we're defaultopen we don't have innovation lockedunder the you know an enclosed spacethat nobody is able to able to access weare default open we work with our teamsin order to ensure that the concepts areworking on our brand relevant and I'llshow you how that works in a minutethese are the skills that we actuallyhave within the team at a high level sowe have everything from sportstechnology to analytics we have anarchitect that works with us we haveneural mechanics we have biomedicalengineering we have a full gamut ofskills that we draw upon as we start tosolve into some of the problems thatwe're looking into solving here's a bitof what we've done that you can actuallysee in our stores today so has alreadyexperienced silver essence or theembedded silver products within ourright of course you have so basically asolution whereby we we've actually wovena silver thread or the silver yarn intoour garments in order to deal with odorso silver is an anti microbial agent andso we've worked out ways to actuallyembed silver into our products so thatwe can kill the odor causing bacteriathat is left on your nasty germs gymshirt and you as you leave it in yourbag so this whole silver line ofproducts is something we've involved ina bunch of matte architecture if you gointo the Robson Street store you'll seea concept called the joinery which is amen's concept for personalizing shortswhere you can actually take a customliner and add a custom pair of shorts ohwe can we can actually customize thatsolution for you a few years back we dida heart rate monitor bra we've done abunch of work in compression so theseare all solutions that we've worked onin theterm so innovation this is how we defineinnovation within our group so we saythat innovations about solving problemsthat people care aboutto unlock net new value and sustainbehavior change simply put it's reallyabout creating new and sustainable valuethat's really what we're about and wedistinguish this from novelty which isvaluable but not necessarily sustainablewe tend not to get involved in projectsor in work that we would say is novelreally ensuring that we're focusing onthe long term value creation of ourguests how many of you who work ininnovation have ever had the Mayday callwhere things just kind of getting realin the markets and your board ofdirectors or your senior leadership teamsays ok guys we need to innovate gettinginnovate now we gotta come up somethingexactly if I've got a got to move nowwe've got to create something this isnot the foundation for a successfulinnovation team so what we say isinnovation is really a muscle it'ssomething that you invest in and thatyou have to nurture over a long periodof time so a lot of the work that we'vedone previously is worth that's takingyears to come to market with and a lotof the really disruptive concepts thatwe're working on we're just going to bereleasing into the market in the nextyear to two years so we're a team that'sbeen about three years old so it's takenus three years to actually get intoinnovations that we consider disruptiveor market changing and that's the kindof investment that we have from ourleadership team and from the business inorder to do the work that we do and thisis a key point because if we're you gointo building an innovation team andexpect value out of the gate you're notgoing to be set up for success so what'sthe strategyinnovation strategy is really aboutdeveloping the competencies within aninnovation team to actually deliversustained value what it's not is thesuccessful ability to respond to crisisthat being said we have been called intocrisis meetings and we've helped out I'msure you guys have all heard of thisyear luan issue that we had we weredefinitely involved and trying to figurethat one outso we do respond to crisis butfundamentally a sustainable innovationstrategy is one where you're focused ondeveloping sustained value how do we dothat the first thing is that we've setourselves up to sit outside of thecorporate strategy and I'll talk aboutwhat that means in a minute we say as Isaid before that were default open andwe've also successfully implemented aconcept that we brand internally buildin tilt and I'll talk about how thatworks so sitting outside the strategywhat's really important from aninnovation perspective is not to becalled or cut into you conversationsthat are really about how the businesscreates risk mitigated growth andfundamentally that's what strategy isabout strategy is about developingshareholder return and market resultsbased on guidance especially in thecontent and the context of a publiclytraded company if an innovation team isfundamentally wrapped into the corporatestrategy then by definition you're onlyever going to be working on incrementalinnovations so innovations that showincremental value over time we have amandate to offer value and show value intransformative transformationalinnovation as well as disruptiveinnovation in order for us to have thetime to do that kind of workwe cannot be we cannot a sort of bewrapped up into the corporateperspective we need space and distancein order to explore concepts that webelieve are valuable as a company or asa team that doesn't necessarily say thatwe don't add value to the corporatestrategy because as we start to work onlonger-term projects we offerincremental value to the company so ifwe're working on a particular project oron compression let's say it has afive-year vision but there's incrementalvalue that we're seeing or generated orconcepts that we're coming up with wegive those to the business it doesn'ttake away from our ability to actuallyexecute on a longer-term objective wesay that we're default open and I talkedabout this a bit earlier what that meansis that we cannot operate in isolationfrom our inline teams so as soon as wehave an idea that we're working on weenroll the appropriate team within thebusiness to help us think through createprototype into so if we're working on acompression project for example we mighthave an insight that we think is reallyvaluable for our guests as soon as weknow that that's going to affect themen's team or the women's team willenroll them early and they'll be part ofthe innovation process along with us wedon't have the budgets the time and ourorganization is far too small for us todevelop a concept in isolation and thenhand it off to an inline team tocommercialize and the inline teams havetheir own strategies they have their owndelivery plans and they have their owntime frames that they're working underso we have to get into their agendaversus them have to deal with our agendaand that's a key piece of how we workwithin our businessbuild and tilt the way we do this theway we enroll an inline team into theconcepts that we're working on is webuild them up so we might have aninitial insight and we spend a lot oftime developing that insight doing theresearch to understand what that uniquevalue proposition is building theevidence that that value proposition isvaluable from a guest perspectivesustainable from an innovationperspective and has the opportunity toshift the business in a meaningful wayand as we build that evidence up we'reenrolling the business constantlyworking with the men's team working withthe women's team to ensure that theyunderstand the potential value of thatproject of that idea and that might mean2% 5% of their time over a month or twomonths or three months but then all of asudden when they really get thepotential of the concept they start totake ownership of it they start to drivethe directionthe concept they start to addfundamental value to that concept andbefore you know it that conceptsactually tilted into the business so theconcept of building tilt is simplybuilding up the concept in rolling thebusiness around the value of thatproject and having it naturally tiltinto that business and that can be ayear long it can be two years long itreally depends on the concept that we'reworking on so the process as I saidbefore we play an incrementaltransformational and disruptiveinnovation so that means we developvalue incrementally so it could be justa unique point of view an existingproduct or we might be working insomething more transformational so itmight be a fundamental product or newproduct to the business which we wouldcall transformational or it could bedisruptive a destructive concept has apotential in our definition to disruptthe competitive market so that means ourcompetition starts to react differentlyto us because of that innovation so wework in all of those three paradigmswith the consistent goal whether it'sincremental transformational disruptivewith a consistent goal to work towards atechnical Epiphany the Epiphany isdefined as a perception of the essentialnature or meaning of something in ourworld world a technical epiphany is aconcept a project a product that leadsto the radical change in meaning ofsomething so a good example of atechnical epiphany is actually the yogapants' that we create so back in the daywhen we developed the first yoga pant itwas solving into this idea of yoga agreat product that we made women lookgreat and feel great in the context of astudio sport like yoga but they havewomen have completely shifted themeaning of that product they were as afashion item they wear it not only inthe gym but outside of the gym in thestudio out of the studio the fundamentalmeaning of that product has changed andthat's a benchmark that's a bar for usto solve into every time there's a greatbody of work written byRoberto or over again ante and heactually the one who coined the conceptof technical Epiphany and for those ofyou who work in this area I wouldencourage you to look into that as anHBR article definitely read it it's aphenomenal understanding of how tocreate innovative product and we usethis as a standard within our ownconcepts I'm not gonna explain it toomuch here but it's definitely worthlooking into so once we have an idea anew concept that we want to create wespend a lot of time developing theunique point of view what is the uniquevalue that this concept idea actuallyhas to offer we find the gaps so we'rein the market does this not exist andwhy doesn't exist we create a hypothesisthat we can solve into and test in toyou and then we develop and build theconcept eventually tilting it into thebusiness so if you were to map that outin terms of a process this is a bitmisleading because it's not linear butbasically what we do is we again atstage 1 define the opportunity stage tounderstand the concept stage 3 tilt itinto the company it's a very simplemodel that takes a lot of time effortand work it kind of actually shows uplike that it's an iterative processwhereby we bounce in and out ofinvention orientation design we getthings wrong we screw it up we go backto design again we go back to hypothesisagain we piss off our inline partners wefind other inline partners it's not it'snot clean but it works and the idea atall stages is to understand what it isthat you're actually developing from aunique value perspective what does thatunique point of view that you're tryingto create in the world so I'm gonna showyou a quick video on how that works ornot necessarily how it works but theoutcome of a process like thiscompression is quite a populartechnology and there's a lot of claimsout there in relation to compression andit's quite confusing to people so it'sno wonder that you know people just usethe same thing for everything however wethink that you should use a differentkind of compression for training adifferent kind of compression forbracing and a different kind ofcompression for recovering tight stuffas a compression technology is reallyoptimized for the training part of yourcollaborationthe driving philosophy behind tightstuff is about engineering sensation oneof the things that we found to beuniversal is that everyone we speak tothat likes to wear compression talksabout how they like the way it feelsfeeling fast is really about that directsensation of how the muscle iscompressed and what that's telling thebrain about what it's capable of doingfrom what we understand aboutcompression there is a particular lineand amount of compression that a lot ofthe medical research has told us thatyou start to get physiological effectwhat we've done is created a level ofcompression that is below that typestuff is about getting the right levelof compression so that you're notprotecting your body you're allowing itto be exposed to the body's adaptiveresponse to that training so that youget fitter faster strongerso the unique point of view in that inthat video was simply this that recoverycompression interferes with your body'sability to naturally recover fromexercise and in interfering in thatrecovery you offload the work that yourbody has to do to repair itself if wecould just give you the proprioceptivebenefits of compressions so how it feelsbut not interfere with that process youget stronger faster so a unique point ofview we commercialize the product it'sthe basis of our men's compression panttoday in our stores but the fundamentalimpact of that project was a lot biggerthan thatbased on this project we've actuallyre-engineered how we educate on ourwomen's pants or women's tights so nowwhen you go into our stores and you goand you ask for the wonder under or thealign pant you'll be educated on howthat pant makes you feel that makes youfeel hugged that makes you feel held inthat makes you feel fast so it actuallycreates the foundation of Education forour stores when it came when it comes toour core product line just reallybriefly so we can have all these amazingprocesses and we can have all of theways of working that that fundamentallyallow us to do what we do but in anorganization if you don't haveleadership and if you don't have aculture that supports innovation you'rekind of left dry so we say from ourperspective that leadership isfundamental to how we operate theinnovation mandate is driven from thetop so from the CEOs office but weencourage innovation from the bottomnobody owns innovation in the company weas an organization define innovationconsistently so if there's issues inyour innovation strategies at your atyour own workplaces look to how youdefine innovation because potentiallyyour management team is defininginnovation very differently than yourproduct team now that's the case thatcould be an issueinnovation is a core pillar of theorganization we have a 10 year be hag sobig audacious hairy goal to drive 50percent of our profits from new projectsservices and experiences that don'tcurrently exist that's an innovation Vhag that were that we're actuallyplaying into to thatand whitespace has a seat at theexecutive table so our SVP of innovationsits with the CEO as a direct report sowe have the ear of the CEO all the waythrough the organization our culture ourculture is innovative entrepreneurialirreverent and empowered we've alwayssaid that this is the case and this isour true DNA so this fact in and ofitself allows us to do what we do so howare we innovative have any of you goneto the lab store on Broadway here's areally if you haven't checked it outcheck it out it's right beside WholeFoods or up from Whole Foodswe actually have manufacturing directlyin store so we've actually shifted theway we educate and produce product righthere in Vancouverwe're entrepreneurial there was a spacefor lease in Whistler right beside ourWhistler store so we had one of ourcommunity managers go upstairs lair andhe decided to actually create a storecalled for lease as a bit of a pun andall it is is a community space weactually don't sell a lot of productwhat we do is we host a lot of partieswith athletes that we do a lot of designmeetings and we shape-shift the storebased on what's relevant in terms what'srelevant in terms was happening atWhistler at the time we're irreverentseaweeds we run a half marathon everyyear as we go down for four years and Iguarantee it's the funnest experienceyou've ever had because we don't takeourselves seriously and we we aim to puton the most interesting fun irreverenthalf-marathon that exists on the planetand we're empowered develops chip Wilsonthe founder has always said thatLululemon is really a leadership anddevelopment company it just so happensthat we produce apparel and thatLIVESTRONG today so we're all encouragedto to engage in development personalprofessional leadership and that reallyshows in terms of how we're able to dealwith some of the ambiguities that weface from an innovation perspective sosome thoughts that being said there'sstill challenges right we consistentlyare challenged with balancing theshort-term demands of the company andthe long-term visions of the team andthe only way that that works isthrough constant communication constantupdating to the organization in terms ofwhat we're doing how we're doing itconstant enrollment in the organizationof the mandates that we're working underbut it for sure is is challenging teamstructure we actually shape-shift ourteam often so if there's a reorg in thein the company oftentimes our team willshape shift in order to account for thatteam or for that change in theorganization because what's really clearfor us is we cannot work in isolationfrom the inline teams of the company sowe have to adapt based on how thecompany adapts and so it's a consistentchallenge and a consistent reflectionfor us are we actually structured theright way tilting do we actually haveenough mass built around a concept totilt it in the organization if we don'tthe concepts dolls if we force it inthrough organization it gets rejected sothat this concept of tilt is somethingwe spend a lot of time on and then Ijust said building profile we're a smallinnovation team we're very much verymuchscrappy very much unlike the the hivesof the of the worlds like Nikesinnovation team we're small we'rescrappy and so we're always trying tobuild profiles so that we can startworking with our vendors and ourpartners but differently we've done agreat job so far but it's a consistentjob for us and I deliberately did notput budget as an issue because ourbudgets are small but as I said beforescarcity is the mother of invention sowe're okay working with tight budgetsbecause it forces us to thinkdifferently some guardrails definedinnovation consistently yourorganization create space for them fromthe business so from that corporatestrategy to actually work on conceptsthat are important include the businessin your decisionsdon't create bombs these are these sortof fully baked ideas that you pass offto commercialise team commercializationteam to execute right enroll them in theprocess always real valuate yourstructure and how you're set up to makesure you're doing what you can be doingdevelop culturally relevant processes sowe say that if we were to pluck whitespace out of Lululemon and put itsomewhere else it would neverwork we've structured our teamexplicitly to work within Lululemon andso when I go on to my next thing or whenTom goes on to his next thing we'll haveto start from the ground up and figureout your building tilt paradigm closingthoughts innovation muscle not Maydaymake sure your strategies reflectculture scarcity know that we'reuniquely the lemon and it's all a workin progress so once you have thatconcept once you have the idea done justnote that the brand is the final filterso no matter what you work on no matterwhat you do you have to ensure that whatyou are working on makes sense for theorganization and so you're gonna seesome stuff that comes up in the nextyear or two years from our team and fromthe business that you're gonna wonderWow how is this Lululemon but if youthink really hard about the brand you'llknow exactly how it fits that's it thankyou very muchThank You Bryan actually they're theyneed to set up the panel for the nextpanel session so if you wouldn't mindjust staying on I have a question foryou and they sure anyone in the frontrow that I'm just wondering what's thewhat's your most favorite project thatyou've worked on at Lululemon so far mymost favorite project that ever got Imean you're what we were proud of that'sa tough one I think one of the mostinteresting is the joinery out of ourRobson store the reason being is becausethat was something we spun up within sixmonths so idea to implementation withina store in six months because we wantedto validate a hypothesis that wasrelated to completely different projectthat isn't actually released yet sothat's sort of like a project indisguise that so not to allude toanything but take a look at the joineryand I know that that's there's a lot ofthinking behind that is there anythingthat you guys have launched internallyor worked on internally that didn't makeit to commercial stage yes are you okayto share that eyes and there's a few andI would probably say not but I would saythat failure happens all the time in ourbusiness and what we say is we can killa project any time so doesn't matterwhat stage of the process we're we're init's the right of anybody in the teamand the company to actually challengethat concept we have to defend the stuffthat were working on and ensure that thebusiness understands the value and if wecan't defend that or if the businessdecides that it's not relevant then thenwe take the appropriate measures wellthank you very much crying it's been apleasure having you here today one lessround of applause thank you thank

hi everyone abby here today i'm going tobe reviewing theengineered warmth jogger from lululemonbut before i get started make sure tohit that subscribe button so you canstay tuned to all my new videos droppingweeklyand so you can help the channel grow sothese are the engineered warmthjogger they are in a size 12 and theyare in the color graphite grayand white so why i purchased thesejoggers was to be active in them to workout outside of themultimately just to go walking andrunning in them in colder weatheri do want to say that these joggers aredefinitely slim fittingso i decided to size up one i'mtypically a size10 in lululemon bottoms but i did decideto size up to a size 12 and i'm veryhappy i did do so so i'd recommend thatif you guys are planning to be active inthese outside and if you do want tohave the possibility of layeringdefinitely do size up oneso the fabric on these isit's something new to lululemon that ihaven't seen from them in the pastit is their engineered knit and it's 3dtextured merino wool so i'm just goingto go ahead and show you guys a tag foranybody who wants to see thatinformationi'm just going to kind of do a close-upnow you can definitely see that it'smore of like a salt and pepper look youcan see the graphite gray and the whiteall textured throughouti really do like this color i think it'snice and it's flatteringso it does have two pockets on the sideand they are zippered pockets i reallylike this because you'reif you're being active outside you don'twant to have to worry about kind ofsomething falling out of your pocket sothis is awesome for thatand as you can see there are cuffs atthe bottom of the joggersand it does have a nice drawstring hereum there's a little tiny logoon there so i'm gonna go ahead nowand flip it over to show you guys theback okay so this is what they look likefrom the backi do want to show you guys that it iskind of two-toned hereum i hope that's showing on camera soum yeah so there's a kind of a darkerpattern here a little bit lighter as yougo towards the bottomand it's definitely flattering on and asyou can see there is a logo right hereon the leg so now i'm going to go aheadand try these on so you guys can seewhat they look like on meall right so this is what they look likeon meso the drawstring here is um a nice sizeit's a little shorter than like theready to ruler for example but it'sdefinitely enough to tie it up if youneed to tighten themthe pockets do have a zipper and theyare nice and big you can definitely fiton your wholephone in there there is a logo down hereit's like the silver logo the classiccolor from the backall right so that's what they look likeon me okay guys so i hope seeing me trythese on was helpful for youi did tell you guys that these are warmi definitely think they're the warmestpair of joggers that lululemondoes have i think it's due to that kindof 3d knitthat they came out with this year sosomething about the 3d knit i want tosay is that it feelsdifferent to any other fabric that i'veever tried from lululemonit doesn't feel like buttery soft itdoesn't feel coarse or scratchy oranything like that it has its own uniquefeel i would say it definitely feelslike a knit materialthat is it's hard to explain until youunless you kind of feel it yourself butit's definitely a uniquefabric feeling it is nice and warm it'snot coarse it doesn't kind of irritateyou but it definitely does feeldifferentum it's unique to anything i've everfelt from lululemonso all i can say is if you get yourhands on them definitely you know reachinside and touch it because the insideand outsideare different fabrics and they do feeldifferentit's super comfortable it is warm and ihighly recommend them for you knowany outdoor activity in the cold weatherif you're looking to stay warmi typically use this for my winterwalking and running and i find that theyare fantastic for thatum my thighs touch as you guys do seewhen i try on that stuff and thereis very minimal peeling all right so i'mgoing to do a close-up hereturn on the light so you guys can seethat this is kind ofthe crotch area i want to show you guysthatthere is no pilling all rightthere is none i do want to saythat right across the seams it's alittle bit like fuzzyright where kind of my thighs rubtogetherbut there's no pilling and i've wornthis thinguh i want to say at least 30 times um sofarsince i've gotten them and honestly theyare holding upamazingly okay guys the quality is herei know this is one of lululemon's morepricier joggersand i think it is pricier because of thekind ofother technologies that they have inthere that they don't have in any otherjoggers that they have so it'sdefinitelypriced up there but honestlyi have tried every single one oflululemon's winterized kind of pantsor joggers for four tightsfor running in the winterbecause i typically go running andwalking in the winter so i triedall of them and this one is the warmestpair i foundthis one kind of kept me warmer thananything else but i do want to say thatonce it getsreal cold you definitely do have tolayer so i always recommend if you aregoing to get a joggerto size up so you're able to do that ifyou do want to get out and get active inthe winter or get out and get activewhen it's really coldso i definitely want to tell you guysthat these are excellent at kind ofthermoregulating your temperature i douse them primarily when it is coldoutside to go walkingand to go running and i never findmyself overheating at alli never find myself feeling too coldit's just that perfect sweet spot in themiddleand i don't know how this fabric does itbut it does so i really appreciate thatand like i said it's definitely a uniquefeeling fabricwhen you first put them on and you walkaround for a couple seconds you're goingto be like this feels strangebut the sensation kind of you get usedto itin a way and like i said they'redefinitely warmand they're comfortable to wear and ithink they're pretty flatteringfor this particular jogger i wouldrecommend sizing upone it does depend on your preferencesand what you're looking to use them forfor me because i do want to be active inthem and i want to have the opportunityto layer when it gets really coldi did size up one and i find sizing upone helps them look more like joggersand kind of less like a legging becausethey are a slim fitted joggerokay guys so considering the price thequality the functionality the comfortthe fit and everything like that i wouldgo ahead and give these a 9.6 out of 10.and i definitely do give them a thumbsup and i'd recommend them for younow if you are looking to buy theengineered warmth jogger just check mydescription for a link belowand i would say always continually checkthe we made too much

hey Internet so this video is going tobe a real kind of medley of informationfor you guys I got some new things atLululemon that I want to share with youbecause that is my favorite workoutwe're brand and I kind of rewardedmyself for my personal achievement ofrunning my first run which was an 8k inVictoria which I never thought I wouldbe able to do over the giving weekend ifyou sell my cozy fashion outfits videothen you have seen the medal that I gotfor that which you know everybody getsjust kind of completing that and runningthe whole akawithout having to walk with one of thetop five like achievements that I'veever achieved and so that's kind of whyI got some new things from the lemon andthen I know a lot of you guys have beenasking me I'm just for some tips orinformation on what I do to stay fit andactive so I'm going to talk a little bitabout that after I show you what I gotfrom the lemon and then finally I'mgoing to take you with me on my next runwhich is this weekend because I justwanted to sign up for something to kindof keep going with it and keep myselfmotivated and so I'll share a like alittle mini vlog with you at the endwhich will include my outfit that I'llbe wearing so one of the things that Iknew I wanted to get from them is one ofthe run swiftly Tech long-sleeve crewshirt so this is made of a specialfabric to wick away moisture but alsokeep yourself cool because I overheatvery very easilythis shirt is really neat it has aclassic Lululemon thumb holes which aregreat for me because I have a wristinjury that kind of gets cold moreeasilyLululemon does a lot of pretty colors intheir clothing and in case you'reinterested they have this in a beautifulburgundy as well I was so tempted to getthat um but it really doesn't go with myrunning shoes which are pink andturquoise um so I got the blue insteadand I got a size up in this as well incase you're interested in ordering itonline on all of the sales girls agreedwith me that it kind of tends to fit alittle bit tighter be a little bit lessforgiving than most of their other topsthat can top I got isn't actually towear runningno I'm guilty but this was in the saleso if you're interested they might stillhave it it's some sixty-nine dollarsdown from 98 which is really good forLululemon and it's called the sweaterthe better which I think is kind of funand it's basically a cotton sweater withventing down the front which is in thisreally pretty sort of trapeze umshape and I really like this just theway it fits with the pockets and thethumb holes it's really flattering onyour figure it's kind of nicely fittedbut still pretty loose I'm and thecotton it is really great so it's moreof like a nap prey sort of exercise topor for a kind of cozy day or somethinglike that it's really nice and it reallyis nice enough to sort of get away withon a casual Friday in the office as wellactually for me then I actually triedsomething new from them which are thewomen's ultimate padded run sock I thinkthese are relatively new from aLululemon and they're $14 which is crazyfor a pair of socks but if you get umblisters running like I do then you knowthat getting good socks that willprevent that is so expensive so unless Ifind somewhere online that stocks paddedRed Sox getting them from the runnerRunning Room or whatever is just asexpensive I think they're actually $20there they have these kind of white andgray ones that are their own brand whichwork really well too those are the onesI wore for my 8k I didn't get anyblisters which is really good I guess Ijust have delicate on the skin on mytoes but I kind of wanted to try the newlemon one because I know most of theirfabrics contrary to some of the scandalsabout transparent but Lululemon pantsare for the most part really highquality so I wanted to give those achance the last two purchases that Imade are maybe not that exciting lookingbut they're kind of awesome for runningand for lounging in and so of coursethose are Lululemon pants so the firstpair that I got which was not on sale isthe skinny groove pant I think it's apermanent item for them now so I likethat they're skinny because I don't liketoo much fabric when I'm running and Ialso think that these are reallyflattering and easy to wear with a pairof boots or something like that I wouldtotally wear these on the weekend Idon't buy Lululemon pants just toexercise in they're way too expensivefor that you have to be committed towearing them to just everythingbasically outside of work which isreally like Vancouver culture to spendyour weekend and partly in workout wearis just so kind of local here I see somany people doing that so these arereally great for that and they're justreally comfortable as well just in termsof the rise they don't dig in oranything like that so I'm really happywith this design that they've come upwith and then the last thing that I gotfrom them um is actually also in theirsale if you're interested and these arethe wonder under pantroll-down so what they mean by rolled inand I was really unsure about thisbecause it's not clear to me is thewaistband can actually be rolled down soyou can wear it high-waisted or kind ofon the lower waisted side these areactually meant to be a little bitcropped but because I'm short at 5-4these are basically full-length leggingsthat end at my ankles which I reallylike um and the again kind of fit alittle bit more tightly than a lot oftheir pants so I got a size 4 in thegroove pants but I got a size 6 in thewonder under pant because I felt likethese were tighter on than the otherones that's just how I found them to fiton so I'm just letting you guys knowbecause for online ordering likesometimes it's really hard to figure outso these were 74 dollars down from 98which is quite a good deal and the bestpart of these in my opinion so these arebasically like leggings on for runningthey're definitely a slim fit with a lotof kind of tailoring going down the legto make sure that they fit your legsreally well but they are so pretty atthe bottom I hope that you guys can seethis it's basically like a perforatedlace detail with venting as well downthe sides I guess to keep your legs coolor maybe just to make them look coolprobably most likely but just this kindof scalloped detailing is so fun sotrendy so girly and honestly I justthink it's such a beautiful detail fareunusual to kind of dive into your do youlike my diving motion um dive into yourquestions about exercising and keepingfit um I know just a lot of you guyswant to know what my routine is and Ireally actually think that you've hitthe nail on the head with that onebecause for me exercise isn't aboutfrequency because I don't have the timeor the spirit to kind of exercise everysingle day in terms of actually you knowgoing out and making that a thing um soI think the two main thing things that Iwant to tell you guys is to number onejust kind of be kind to yourself andrealize a lot of things that you'redoing count um so I walk around toeverything I take very few calves ifsomething is under twenty minutes walk Iwill usually walk it whether it's rainor shine and that counts as exercise youguys I don't care what anyone saysthe other one is that to me keeping fitis all about making a commitment toactually doing something a certainnumber of times a week and for me withmy job as a lawyer and my second job asa youtuber putting out videos hopefullyusually twice a week for you guys onMondays and Fridays um it really comesin third or fourth or even fifth placeum which is just being honest like Ijust want to make an honestdown-to-earth video for you guys becauseI feel like so many people on Instagramand like all this information is justthrown at you about having this perfectbody and perfect life where you exerciseevery single day maybe at some point inmy life I will have the time andmotivation to do that but right now mysort of happinessum level comes from exercising twice aweek so I will usually go to the gymonce a week and go running once a weekand or sometimes do one of those twiceif that makes sense so I'll go runningtwice a week or go to the gym twice aweek for example the weather the weatheris really really horrible then I won'tusually go running outside and I'll justgo and do the elliptical at the gym forlike 40 minutes and lift a few weightskind of keep my armsum feeling goodso that's kind of what I do at the gymand running is my new bestie you guys Istill do not consider myself a truerunner just because I'm so naturally badat it that I keep thinking I'm going towake up and all of my achievements forrunning or just going to disappear umit's like this weird paranoia but I amso incredibly proud to have actually runand not walk to that a.k I never thoughtthat I would be able to do that and thesecret to it was just kind of keepinggoing with it and just slowly increasingmy distance over a period of about threemonths that's how long it took me tosort of prep for it but I didn't decidethat I would actually run that run untilabout a month before um so it justobviously was just like I just wanted todo it so badly and it worked out and I'mso happy that I can now kind ofincorporate that into my life assomething that I really enjoy because Ican now run 5k pretty comfortably likeit's not painful to do it anymore andonce you get to that point is just sowonderfulum I cannot encourage you guys enough togo for it if you're hesitating becauseif I can do it you can so completely doit because I failed every beep test inhigh school I'm not kidding every singlebeep test that is how bad I'm at runningum so this weekend I'll be doing a 5kjust to kind of keep myself motivatedand keep running even as the weather ischanging and I thought I would take youguys along with me so I'm gonna finishoff this video tonight after I have hadmy runners beauty sleep and I'll see youguys so high and half to my base inNorth Vancouver it's starting to rainwhich makes me really scary because I'venever gone running under the rain beforebut I'm just going to do it so here's myoutfit no surprises here I'm wearing mylong sleeve top from Lululemon with thelittle cool finger holes in them andtaking a jacket with me which I'll puton rightbecause it's good to just kind of keepit warm before exercising and then I'llprobably leave this in the car because Ijust know how much might overheat whileI'm running so I'm gonna actually needit wearing my awesome new reggae needsand I folded the top up so they're alittle bit on the shorter side you cansee they have the venting and the coollife detailing on the back and I justI'm so in love with them because they'reso so cute then I'm wearing my reallydirtySkechers trainers I feel like I needsome new ones but I'll probably getthose in Hawaii at Christmas wherethings are cheaper so I'm gonna go offon me like maybe I'll show you a fewclips of North van to finish off thisvideo but thank you so much for

everybody welcome back to my channel umso I'm in my work clothes I not havejust gotten back from work but Iactually came back from watching StarWars I know I'm so late on Star Wars Ijust I like Star Wars like I've saw themovies and I love like you know r2d2 andI like I like Star Wars but I'm not likea huge fan of it I'm more of like a Lordof the Rings Harry Potter fan but anywayso I just saw Star Wars and it was itwas good I liked it it was veryentertaining a little cliche in someparts but there's a lot of nostalgiaespecially with like certain scenes andwhatnot and obviously seen people againI wonder I don't want to spoil anythingfor those who haven't watched it but Ienjoyed the movie it's a very good movieit wasn't mind-blowing like maybe forlike hardcore Star Wars fans like it wasmy boy and you know certain scenes werevery like emotional whatnot but to melike it was very good movie veryentertaining I really enjoyed it Ireally enjoyed the references to theolder movies and the older storylinesbut um it wasn't like all you knowanyway so that was really goodalso before I get into my video I wasshopping at South Coast Plaza today andI stopped by Teavana and did you knowthat Teavana is owned by Starbucks andyou can use to start with gift card inTeavana so I had a service gets hard andI like to you honor but you know it'sexpensive but then when the guy told methat Starbucks owns Teavanaand that I can use a Starbucks gift cardlike hell yeah yes I want to drink someyour tea so there are two teas that Ireally like there I'm looking at theirwebsite it's their winter berry teablend as well as their youth berry wildorange blossom tea blend that was verylong I decided to get the youth berryand wild orange blossom tea blendsbecause it is not as sweet as the winterberry tea blend I think they're bothvery good I you know it's kind of warmhere in California now so I tend to likelike the summery more fruity teas coldor hot but yeah so how do they recommendthose two teas and if you have a servicegift card you can go by TiVootherwise like treat yourself once awhile because expensive expensive yesgood but expensiveso yeah today's video I just wanted itit'll be really quick hopefully I don'tblow up on too long I'm a little tiredit's comparing Victoria Secrets exercisewe're active we're with Lululemon as youhave known I shop a lot at Lululemon bylaw so for the lemon and I did buy somethings at Victoria's Secretsum do I have any of it to show you guysbe right backI've returned with my Victor super 7some Lululemon stuff um so I had themajority of my art said where is fromLululemon by the way I'm not sponsoredby Victor secrets or little lemon ortevonn or anything they don't know Iexist they probably don't care this isjust my personal opinionum so my overall impression is that Iprefer the lemon yes I have worn dolimit for a longer period of time and Ihave more of their clothes so I get toexperience more of their stuff but Iguess I'm at Victoria's Secret sizingand fit doesn't work as was Lululemondoes so this is what I got VictoriaSecrets I got this sports bra hasbuilt-in padding you cannot remove thepadding and this is the back quite cuteand simple and then what else I gotVictor secrets are these shorts this iscalled the knock out by Victoria Secretshot shorts I have this in grey like thisheathery gray color husky Lucien alightand I have it in black which is righthere but I don't wanna show to youexcuse me from and I will compare themto Lululemon shorts which these are Ijust recently did a haul on thisactually these are I don't have I cutoff the labels so I could wear them butI think this is called the what thesport shortsyou can look at my latest Lululemon haulfor that but they look very similarright to Victoria's Secret's you knowthey look like black and compressibleand stretchy this one is in color sohopefully you can see it a lot better Ifound that that was more of a comparableversion to Victoria Secrets and I have alot of Lululemon sports bras and onvarious different kinds and I wouldn'treally know what's comparable toVictoria's Secret's so we're just goingto assume everything so yeah Ipersonally like the Lululemon bootyshorts a lot more than Victoria'sSecrets I buy a size two in shorts forthe limit and I buy an extra small forVictoria's Secret's I realized thatfollow they both you know are notsee-through and they both are verycomfortable and they both look good onme the Victoria Secrets tend to scrunchup really easily they tend to ride upreally quickly and I'm constantlypulling them down Lululemon is if thesize is rightnot so much I have bought this in a sizefour and I realize they do scrunch up alittle bit but the size too is perfectbasically very minimal scrunching up Idon't have to adjust it so often sothat's my experience with little bitsare no with this Victoria Secret sportsbra I actually really do enjoy theconvenience of the built in paddingbecause with Lululemon you know you haveto put it in and take time it's kind ofannoying you have to make sure you knowit fits well so this is just veryconvenient fast but I don't think thatthey fit me as well I think that theunder strap right here is not as secureand tends to slip up like right up as Iwork out I don't think I've got this thewrong size trust me I have a small chestand this is the smallest size they haveand it fits my cup size so it is alittle tight on the shoulders then againyou know sports bras tend to be a littlebit more snug but it's kind of weirdwhen it's tighter on the shoulders andthen looser on the bottom and then whenit starts writing up the tightness onthe shoulder just pulls up with it rightso I kind of sometimes have to adjust ita little bitworking out it's not like nothing'spopping out or showing but it's justkind of annoying something I just don'twant to deal with grand secret orsecrets is a lot more affordable thanLululemon but if you buy little little alittle limit on sales basically sameprices Victoria's Secret retail price soyeah I think material-wise they are bothvery comfortable and I don't have aproblem with like heats or chafing orlike I don't know like marks or anythinglike thatnothing cutting into my skin that makesit painful irritated but I think thatlittle lemon fits me better which Itotally don't mind you know there'ssomething for everybody and everyone hastheir own preferences and their owncomfortsso yeah this are just my thoughts on thetour secrets versus Lululemon activewearfor me personally I have heard that alot of more well-endowed females enjoythe sports bras from Victoria Secretsmore because they give them more supportin more room to kind of make sense I dofeel that little lemon tends to runsmall most of the time and especiallywith some of their sports bras tend toyou know they don't have it most of themdon't have underwire or anything likethat so that makes sense um so yeah thatwas itthat was very short did I talk too fastI'm sorry if I talk too fast I just kindof wanted to not block too much cuz I'mtired and I tend to get very rarely whenI'm tired but anyway so I hope that youenjoyed this video and found it helpfuluseful let me know what activewearbrands that you guys like to wear I knowthat um Athleta is really popular gapOld Navy Lucy there's a couple of newones that are pretty popular which Ikind of wrote the names so yeah thankyou

bit of movement into the bodyjust a little sway from side to sidenotice where your breath is think aboutthe back of the neckand maybe even include a little bit ofmovement herereminding yourself that the neck is acontinuation of the spineso just be mindful of that and thenlet's do two big circles in onedirection so just starting to warm thebody up sending some weight through thefingertips and knuckles pushing the bumback towards the heelsand another one nice take two in theother waybreathing and moving and againuntil we arrive back to center for catcows as you inhale drop your bellytowards

this is marketing Jam a show featuringthe brightest minds and marketingbrought to you by Canada Post head toCanada Post see a forward slash insightpodcast or ideas to add value to yourmarketing welcome to the next episode ofmarketing Jam I'm really excited becausewe have Courtney Lawrence who has areally long job title from Lululemonwhich is exciting and it's great becauseLululemon was born and births here in mybackyard here in Vancouver BC butprevious to that not many people knowthis but the creator of it had a brandcalled West Beach which was awesome andall through my junior high and highschool years I wore West Beach clothesand then of course he went on to createsome little yoga clothing thing that Iguess is around the world now yeah Idon't think I knew that actually WestBeach yeah West Beach woman it was itwas like a three surfers all lined upand it was like the cool if you had ayou know it was the cool sweatshirt towhere he always um chip I I explainedlike you always feels like he's got apulse on what's coming nextyeah like it's like almost the gift orthe prophetic you can see what's comingdown the pipes yes well and he'simmersed in the culture so ya know whatI can speak to that and and speakingabout you how did you end up where youare take what's your what's your originstory mm-hmm what is my origin I havealways been interested in human behaviorhuman culture and why people do thingsthat they do and your full job titlejust so people know my full job title isstrategic insights and foresight atLululemon so I will job title it is avery cool job title it requires a bit ofexplaining but essentially I oversee theenterprise-wide insights and foresightfor the business so supporting in how wecan achieve our company goals throughunderstanding our customer the marketand culture okay and when would you forthe demonstrating foresight and insighthow would you describe those from whatyou do insight is essentially what arepeople doing today and what are theneeds right now and how can we look atbehavior and culture from a from a lensof what's going on in the world rightnow foresight is what what projectionscan wewhat scenarios are possible in thefuture hmm and so bringing thosetogether we can kind of extrapolate whatwe think is going to happen byunderstanding today and these fringesignals of what could happen five tenyears from now wow that's really cool soyou basically you have a one finger onthe pulse and the other hand on a what'sa glass ball that tells you the futurethat's right yeah that's right that'sright so an example would be you know ifwe're just broadly speaking talkingabout mental health today what do weknow about how people are coping or whatare the ways that they're finding waysto deal with cognitive training etc andthen in ten years time why do we think athat that is going to be extremelyimportant based on different forces thatare happening politically culturallyeconomically and with technology and theway the the rapid rate of change what ismental health going to look like in thattime so how do we then create a plan toto get there and continue be relevantthat's amazing and they give you theability to do that working at a clothingbrand which is what really is and youknow sell accessories and other stuffbut being there you were able toactually have an impact on everyday lifemm-hmm okay yeah and I would say youknow we are so well known for ourproduct or apparel and we do stand for amuch more holistic lifestyle andexperience and anyone who goes to ourstores knows that we try and create likea real sense of community and offerthings beyond you know just just theamazing product that we have yes so froma brief mental health they kind of lookI had a shirt workout shirt fromLululemon long sleeve kind of dark greengrey brownish type of shirt and I stillhave it actually I still wear it it'sgreat and when I flip up the bottom ofmy shirt there is actually like positiveencouragement along the bottom of theshirt right is that part of theintention to like encourage people helpthem with mental health while they wearclothes that can speak to them yeah youknow I don't know if that was directintentionally related to mental healthor say but it's I think we call themsort of these love notes yeah sort offeatures of surprise and delight so somepeople notice them some people don't butit's it's a nice little feature thatadds a bit of character to the clothingand how did you end up in the roleyou're now because that's such a wildjob you have like to have you knowyou're both a doctor and you're you knowyou're a a genius you're someone who'shaving to see the future right visionaryyeah well I am as I was saying so I'vealways been interested in human behaviorhuman culture personally speaking I grewup with a sister with special needs so Iwas very interested in health the healthcare system psychology why people dothings the way they do things at thesame time I love travelingso then when I was in the university Irealized that there was this fieldcalled anthropology that studied humanculture behavior rituals like just howpeople work together so I studiedanthropology I did a master's in visualanthropology which is about materialvisual environment and then Dan Brownwhat's his character name from Oh fromangels and angels and do that he'sthat's not what he does I don't think noI think he's more archaeology ball and asymbol I just yeah there's lots ofdifferent fields there's like forensicor anthropology archaeology so then Ifound you know at the time that I wasdoing that design thinking was reallytaking off applied anthropology wasbecoming a thing where businesses andand organizations were hiring socialscience researchers to help them betterunderstand their customers or theirclients or the markets that they werethat they were in so after University II started working in Toronto I gothooked up with the innovation kind ofindustry there worked for a coupledifferent firms innovation consultingdesign etc and led a lot of insightsprojects so helping clients across manymany different industries understand youknow why their consumers were notgravitating towards a campaign or youknow how we could redesign a certainproduct experience so I did that andthen one of my last clients wasLululemon and yes the rest is history IwasI was offered a position to start firstin the white space innovation team ILululemon so I was there I've been therefor the last almost three years and thenrecently transitioned to the morestrategy side of things it's really coolyeah for those that are listeningwatching Mountain Gladwell wrote a bookcalled the tipping point and I think alot of people have read that would youcall that that's a good to kind ofdipping your toe into the work that youdo when he kind of kind of analyzes thehumanity and how they interact withbrands and how brands go viral or that'dbe almost a different science what youdo uh I would say that's not the sciencethat I are the social science ofanthropology necessarily but it is therethere's so many connected fields thesedays humanities would you say what hedoes well there's there's like thefields of behavioral economics exampleyou know predictably irrational or whata lot of those books that talk about whypeople make the decisions that they makeI think another really blossoming fieldis the field of neuroscience and neuralmarketing and so they all kind of worktogether anthropology at its core isreally about understanding context sowhen you have a product or a service andyou're putting it in the hands of aconsumer you're not distilling orisolating that one interaction from therest of their life so you know I hadheard this example recently where ayogurt brand was trying to launch theiryogurt in Japan and they asked a fewtypical marketing questions of you knowdo you do you eat consume dairy in Japando you have yogurt and this is the veryquick version of this story and so theylaunched essentially the same productthat they had in North America and itflopped completely and it floppedbecause while the culture was one wherethey actually ate dairy they didn't takeinto con into they didn't realize thecontext through which people were eatingdairy so it was actually on theircommute they wouldn't sit down theywould they eat with chopsticks theydon't eat with spoon so they often haddairy in more liquid forms through strawyeah so were they yeah yeah so they'd bedrinking it on the go and you know sothe whole ritual ritual around eatingand food was different so anthropologyis really trying to understand theenvironment the culture in the contextmore so then just how is someone goingto interact with this service product orexperience because you could be aVancouver Winnipeg or Toronto basedproduct that does really well and youcuts right blow up regionally that'sright yeah Winnipeg no one reallyrealized like but what am I guess reallylong winters I mean and just that you'reyou know certain shoes wouldn't workthere in the winter you know it's youknow the summers are different and everycity is day yeah that's right and I meanI when I was in consulting I did aproject for a big CPG beauty company andthey had launched a campaign in Quebecand again the campaign had flopped ithad done really well in Eastern and therest of Canada and they didn't know whyso instead of just asking you know whatdo you like or not like about thiscampaign what's resonating we did a moreethnographic cultural study andunderstood that the mentality of thisparticular segment was that based onhistory of the church being extremelymaterialistic there was a negativeperception of being too ostentatiousyeah so the ad which was kind ofHollywood glam yeah we just did notresonate whatsoever because of thathistorical cultural deep-seatedresentment towards the church so youknow it's I think there's so muchrichness and being able to studyconsumer and I don't even I tend to tryI try not even use the word consumerbecause it's people as humans who livein a context and make decisions abouthow they're gonna interact with brandsbut you have to understand the historythe environment the political forces associal forces all of that wow that'sincredible because I we had anotherguest on the show David Allison wrote abook called value graphics where he wasarguing that it's not about theirmillennial or their age because he saysso many companies get stuck that waybecause right I'm millennial inVancouver is gonna be different in amillennial in Cape Town that's right andand his argument is it's about thevalues they have but what you're sayingis not just their valuesit's what shows they got brought up withthe culture they live it it's all theconditioning around it and and thevalues are a consequence of that at apiece often and a piece of that so Iagree it's very much it's less about thedemographics and more about thepsychographics the culture the you knowwhat what cult like the overarchingvalues of a community or a group thathas a set of practices and ritualstogether so when you see a workshop or awebinar or conferences like how to reachMillennials yes do you can I roll do youthrow their youth a role in your lifewell I think there's there's definitelyvalue and importance it and there arekind I believe these sort of sweepingstatements that can be applied to ageneration because that the generationregardless of which market may havefaced these universal forces like youknow a huge recession or a war orsomething that could could influence sothere is there's definitely you knowvalue in looking at those demographics Ijust say like let's slice it down intowhat's the particular particularsubgroup that we're looking atyeah and for whatever brand you work foror whatever brands you're representingand the way you can apply this is theythink more deeply think moreholistically right start to break outkinda was unpack the onion yeah thepeople are that you're trying to reachright with your product right brand yourmessage right exactly a 24 year oldgrowing up downtown Mexico City in aworking family is very different from a24 year old brought up in I don't knowvagina on a farm like so yeah you haveto really understand the thesurroundings of of your target andensuring you can not only then helpthese people better communicate to thembetter but then you know the sidebenefit of you can sell things to thembetter way to market to them better yeahyou can you can understand what they'relooking for you can understand theirneeds in a deeper way and and create asense of like authenticity like youactually understandand you ultimately are trying to servewhatever needs that that they have yeahand so people that want to go deeperinto this and learn moreis there any like websites or podcastsor books that you recommend hmm there'sa lot of books these days around appliedanthropology consumer anthropologyethnic ethnography and business Iactually have I have a link that I justgot the other day has like the ten booksto read which I can maybe share a fewright we'll put it in the yeah you knowit's yeah so there's a bunch of books Iactually you know I I don't really readthat many books as much as I amconstantly just reading articles andthey actually don't do reddit um butthere's a lot of like even just the NewYork Times or The Economist TheEconomist like there's there's greatpieces out there even just on socialmedia like seeing what's being postedthat's all indicative of the culture andwhat's your list coming so I'm listeningand then obviously for Lululemon in thehealth and wellness base on all thedifferent blogs and yeah I'd say it'slike just finger on the pulse of what'sbubbling up and trying to identify whenthey're starting to become patterns ofnoise or signals yeah yeah maybe whatare some trends that you're seeingwhether it's people accepting this rolein the brand and accepting this sort ofresearchor maybe trends that you're seeing thatare coming down where brands areactually implementing what you've beenlearning hmm I wouldn't say it's a trendbecause I think it's been growing forever since I've been in consulting butjust you know human centered designhuman centered marketing design thinkingall of the practices that really put thehuman first and that's really what Istand for is like if you really want tounderstand and know how they feel andhow they think but also how they feelthen you can't just do that in a focusgroup or a usability lab or a survey asurvey yeah you have to spend time withyou just like we're sitting down andtalking right now like it's aconversationand so I see more and more brandsinvesting in that type of insight workinternally building out teams that dothat hiring ethnographers oranthropologists so that is definitelytaking that has definitely been growingand now I'm seeing much more in the lastfew years the implementation ofneuroscience cognitive sciencesbehavioral science behavioral economicsjust to round that outare you a Android or iPhone user I'm aniPhone user okay so someone in your rolewhat are the apps that you're like onthe daily like you're going there andyou're kind of like consuming or maybeyou're putting content into mmm for mywork or but or just in general yeah Idefinitely say Instagram okay yeah ismostly what I'm looking at I'm lookingat Apple news a little bit that's gonnaneed a pilot yeah yeah it just kind ofputs the highlights up there beyond thatit's yeah I mean LinkedIn is anotherplace where I get interesting articlesbut otherwise there's certain databasesand things that I'm looking at more formy work yeah than apps specifically okayyeah and as far as someone who wants toget into the role you're doing nowsomeone's gonna be a student or they'reand they're in a position they want toshift into what you're doing what aresome recommendations you can give themmmm be curious the first recommendationI don't want to say there's a path to towhere I am right now I would just say becurious about human behavior motivationsand in whatever way you can learn aboutthat whether it's taking a course inhuman centered research anthropologydesign thinking and really questioningyou know in marketing questioning themethods and the ways we go about tryingto understand a quote consumer and youknow thinking about putting them aspeople in humans first and the otherthing I would say is just gettingcurious like in casual conversation andtalking to people like I don't have togo andand you know create a research projectto be gathering information on gatheringinformation all the time when I go workout when I yeah so it's that curiosityconstant curiosity about what'shappening in the world and and yeah Imean I'd say even for my roleyou know while I'm reading thesearticles and and sites we have liketrend sites that we belong to it ceteraI'm also learning from different peoplearound me I've been studying tribIndigenous Studies with two teachers fora while so that keeps me you knowculturally aware watching the news likeother ways just engaging in community asa way to yeah do you think curiositylike that someone who is innatelycurious do you think that can benurtured is that like a you know arethey born with it or is it somethingthey can like make happen in their lifemm-hmm it's funny because one of thefirst firms that I worked at was calledcuriosity Inc oh and my my boss managerat the time who's a good friend and sheis upset like her thing is curiosity andI remember doing some research oncuriosity and seeing like is it naturenurture I absolutely think it can benurtured who I think I was actuallyspeaking last night I did a I'm doingToastmasters nice ah which is reallyreally fun and last night I did a talkon imagination as as medicine as healingso and I gave this story I was on aplane on the weekend where I was told mylaptop for a few hours doing work in theplane and then I looked in front of methat and there was a little boy sittingin the seat in front of me and he waslooking out the window he's probablyseven years old looking at the window Ican't even he was like so in awe of whathe's like clouds water mountains and I Ijust I was like close to my laptop rightaway looked at the window and was likeyeah it's beautiful I take for grantedI'm in a plane all the time I take itfor granted andso just reminding myself and rememberingthat you can be curious about anythingyeah so maybe there's not you like achildyeah be that childlike wonder curiositysee I mean you have to do I have to orone as a researcher has to be curiousevery time because I can be studyingyoga yes I've been you know for I I'vetaught yoga I know all about yoga buteach time I study it I need to come withlike a beginner you know mindset thatI'm not the expert there's something I'mgoing to learn yeah any topic if you'reworking a CPG company if you're bringingautomotive and you know that industryreally well there's always room to learnmoreif you're curious so maybe bring a kidto work day bring your kid to work andsee what questions they ask that's acool idea like you know if you just makeit happen yeah yeah like I'm not I'm nota parent but whenever I see kids you'reasking really smart questions becauseyou're asking in some cases it's likethe obvious question but the obviousquestion doesn't always give the obviousanswer yeahand I often all even somebody's on theopposite and I'll bring someone who'slike sixty five-plus right into ourworld and they ask also that's reallygood question yes because some of thesuffer is new yeah yeah exactly yeah youknow I when I talk to my mom about someof the things I'm doing and and then Ihave to roll my eyes cuz she doesn'tunderstand or is questioning but then Irealize like it's really great because Ihave to really explain or understand thequestions that she's having where she'scoming fromyeah so I've shared this before but onthe show but there the term genius likewe see genius bars at Apple and and Iknow some geniuses and in previousgeniuses the term comes from the originthe term comes from you know from thegenie people who could hear from thegenie which again Aladdin just yeahmovies come out with the genie thatcomes out it you know it's a yeah somefigure right like a kind of a spiritualfigure yeah and so they found people whocould hear from the genie we're geniusesso we've now made it out to be peopleare just really really smart can fixyour Apple computer but I'm curious inyour line of workhow many often do you ever meet a genelike from the genie type of person whocould just see something hear somethingand just go for it because I seen thiswith some brands before and whereas somepeople were just like really just smartand they've done their research and theyjust clinically know that that's theright product to take to market becauseI feel like both can be right and I seenboth be really successful but I'm justcurious yeahhow can you see those two worlds or havethose worlds collided I love that Ididn't know that that was the etymologyor the origin of the word yes so nowwhen you go to Apple oh yeah yeah I'llbe like oh right now it's veryinteresting because my take on that isthis genie or this spiritual figureforce is really I mean I'd consider I ama spiritual person I believe like I canget dreams or visions that I'll actuallylisten to and it's really in some waysit's you know it could be your intuitionor people can feel things see things andand it's the people who act on them Ithink that that we would call thegeniuses so I know there's a handful ofpeople at Lululemon who others would sayare like sort of visionary because theyare seeing or sensing things visionsthere yeah visions or there's like anelement of creativity and not boxing itinto what has been taught or rationallywhat makes sense but yes in 10 years oryes in five years this is what we shouldbe doing even though there's no kind ofimmediate rationale behind that but yeahso I mean I would say there theredefinitely are people like that and thething is they have the courage to listento those messages rather than having tofeel like they need to defend it or putit aside discount because we've alsoprobably met people who who arevisionaries and geniuses yeah and but Iand I've heard them say I thought ofthat idea five years ago I got out ofthat last year right right great yeahI'd like a moment of clarity or a momentof got a download a download from theuniverse or from a source yeah whateveryou want to call it but in my mind yeahit's the spirit like it's a connectionto gradersspirit that can give you these amazinglycreative ideas and it's just the courageto take them forward into the world andconvince and tell people why they why weneed to make them happen and maybe evensometimes they go against insight andforesight right and but maybe they alignwith it perfectly right and so maybe andsave room for that but also at the sametime how do we stay keep our finger onthe pulse rightdoes the world need more scrunchies yeahwhat which way you know what our headtrends going toward yeah do we keepputting hoods on jackets right yeah likethat which is fascinating that you gotto be a part of that yeah it's listeningand hearing that stuff yeah it'sdefinitely fun Wow anything else thatyou want to share with listeners andviewers in the show today I would justreinforce again in marketing in the workthat we do just to keep remembering toput the person first and look at salesnumbers revenue targets five-year goalsall of that and at the end of the day ahuge huge portion of the success ofthose comes down to how much we canempathize and understand and talk topeople as humans and not just targets orstatistics or whatnot so the curiousimmerse yourself in the community inculture watch for those kids on theplane who can teach you something andand yeah just ask ask a lot a lot ofquestions this is awesome thank you somuch thank you thank you for having meyeah hopefully you can nurture yourchildlike wonder this was a reallyinspiring and insightful conversationthey're gonna have notes in there forother books and resources that you cancheck out but thank you so much forjoining us for the marketing Jam andwe'll

[Music][Music]so today I wanted to do a Lululemoncollection haul review try on everythingat Lululemon so this video is not tobrag about my collection it's not eventhat much but it's not to brag and ifyou don't like seeing these and you canexit out of the video people are askingme why are you showing stuff that youbought because I love watching haulvideos I love seeing what people arebuying it saves me a trip to the storeand I also like it when people try it onthe item because then I get to see howit fits on their body and if their bodytype is similar to mine I'll buy itvideos gonna be in two parts the firstpart is just an overview of Lululemonthe second part is kind of going throughmy collection and I will be modeling allof the clothing items so you can see howthey fit guys are not familiar withLululemon Lululemon is a Canadian asportswear company they started and Ithink like 2000 early 2000s and theystarted because they were really likeinto teaching yoga and other fitnessclasses and then the owner I think hisname is chipI've decided to make workout clothingand then the workout clothing reallytook off and now it's become this hugelike like sportswear clothing line forwomen who have a men's line but it's notas popular as the women's line Lululemonis an incredibly high price point it ishigher than definitely forever21 higherthan Nike so their jackets this jacketfor example that I'm wearing it is thedance studio jacket is $120 this tankretails for I think 50 and their yogapants start at $98 plus tax so over $100black yoga pants so might think like ohyeah it's so expensive why would anyonebuy and that's what I thought when Ifirst started before I had any Lululemonand then about my my first bought myfirst pair of group pants and ever sincethen you know I keep buying Lululemonand I bought other you know sportswearbrands especially those subscriptionservices ones and they do not evencompared to what Lululemon has to offerme their clothing fits is justincredible it's kind of like almost likeI think bb-but for like sportswear soeven though you'reworking out you don't have to work outand like a t-shirt and gym shorts youcan work out and cute fitted gymclothing and some of their outerwear andlegging was perfect enough you know towear just running errands or going outor whatever and also the details oftheir clothing is really reallyspectacular for example this jacket andthey have some holes and most theirjackets which is great for if you arerunning or working out outside you canput gloves or mittens over them theyalso have like it's some other jacketsthis is the dance studio jacket by theway they have a zipper cage so righthere when you zip the zipper all the wayI'm not gonna zip because I have amicrophone but it kind of covers this sothat way your chin won't get cold I meanjust everything is so detailed in theirclothing like this jacket is alsoreversible and so on both sides theyhave kind of this Lululemon logo withthe pockets and it's just very very veryflattering so like their their athleticclothing is very detailed they kind ofput little things here and there thatyou would have never thought of but ifyou're working out everyday then lemoncaters to you know those who are veryserious about fitness those like me whogo to the gym every single day I go tothe gym every morning you know goodquality workout clothes and I thinkworkout clothing it's something that youneed to invest a little bit more in thanjust normal day-to-day clothing first ofall you wear workout clothing every timeyou work out and you sweat in it and soyou have to wash it every single timeyou wear it so it's not like you knowsome clothing items where you can wearit a few times without washing it forworkout clothing you have to wash itevery single time so that does put theclothing through a lot of wear and tearand secondly you're just moving aroundyou're jumping you're stretching you'restraddling whatever kind of workoutyou're doing you're putting it yourclothing through a lot of wear and tearyou're not like just putting it on ahangergive you if you're like wearingsomething at like a fashion show orwhatever you're just like you knowyou're like sitting down and like theclothing is like a rack on you likeyou're like a clothing rack on there butfor workout clothing you're moving youknow the clothing is working with you soI think it does make sense to invest alittle bit more in workout clothingreally do cater to a woman's body theway that like for example the groovepants they're famous black yoga pantsthe way their pants make your butt lookI don't know what it is but your buttlooks amazing like I've never seenanyone's butt look worse and a pair ofLululemon pants the way that their tanksare cut they're just the right lengththey definitely give you an hourglassshape and it's weird that like whileworking out you have an hourglass shapebut like little details like that reallymatter you know the way that thewaistband holds your stomach it doesn'tgive you muffin top it is comfortable itkind of sucks your song again but thesame time being comfortable and thewaistband is thick enough so that way itdoesn't scrunch up and also the way thattheir pants and their hips are cut youdon't really get the camel toe you don'tget really like wedgies on your pantswith a lot of workout companies I getwedgies or I get like really bigcinching around that private area butwith Lululemon you don't really get thatso all these little details really addup when you're working out and you justwant to be comfortable and you want tofeel great in your workout clothing soweird to buy Lululemonyou can just buy it online at Lululemoncomm or you can go to the store now thething I do not like about Lululemon istheir return policy is terrible it's 14day return policy the tags must be onand they cannot be worn so you're reallycareful that if you do try them on likeyou don't break any of the tags youdon't stretch them out or whateverbecause they will not let you returnthings and 14 days is not that greatbecause Nordstrom has like an anytimereturn policy so it could also findLululemon on eBay if you do buy fromeBay I highlyyou make sure it's from a reputableseller that the seller is not locatedand like China or even LA or New Yorkbecause sometimes they get imports fromoverseas there's a lot of fake Lululemonstuff out thereI've definitely bought from eBay andI've noticed that the pants were fakejust like because when you have a realpair of pants from Lululemon and thenyou have the fake ones you candefinitely tell I like to buy clothingfrom people who sell like who sellclothing like not as a job but just likethey want to get rid of their stuffbecause you can trust them where youkind of know that they bought from theactual store and you can also try siteslike Poshmark Poshmark is this amazingapp and this is not sponsored byPoshmark I know a lot of apps aresponsored on YouTube but I am soaddicted to it because you just it'skind of like Instagram but for fashionso I do get some Lululemon items fromPoshmark and if you do want an inviteyou can just email me I'll have my emailbelow email me that you want to inviteto Poshmark and if I invite you you getfive dollars off your order and so ifyou want to you can do that and alsothere's a site called trade see which isvery very similar they don't have asmany items as part does but it'sbasically like eBay but like mobile eBaymobile eBay / Instagram and they alsohave Lululemon items there I did get atank from there and if you want I canalso give you a coupon code or I cangive you an invite and if you use thecode for your invite you get $15 offyour purchase which is a huge steal soif you are interested in being invitedto those apps or getting a coupon codefor them you have to be a first-timeuser I think or on your first purchaseso you can't have purchased from thembefore but email me aha my email belowit's DEA is yours e89 at gmail.com and ican send you the invite code because ionly have like 10 10 codes each accountor somethingokay so now let's get on to thecollection video or I'll try it on theseitems so I will have it either annotatedhere or in the link below thank you guysfor watching bye,17,UCCzODDnIM4xdZxOLUGF7KSg,lululemon,4,23,0,105,"['lululemon', 'run', 'running', 'how to run', '5k training',

hi everyone abby here today i'm going tobe reviewing the another mile jacketfrom lululemonbut before i get started make sure tohit that subscribe button so you canstay tuned to all my new videos droppingweeklyand so you can help the channel grow sothis is the another mile jacket fromlululemon i purchased this in a size 14in the color cassis now one thing i wantto say about this jacketis that i found that it definitely didrun tighti tried on a size 12 which is my typicalsizing for jacketsand it was just so tight i couldn't evenzip it up over my bust not being able tozip up your jacket is definitely anissueso once i was able to get my hand on asize 14it fit like a dream now i will say it'ssuper flattering even though i did sizeup one thing about this jacket is that ii've gotten compliments on iti really love the cass's color and asyou guys can see from my other videosi've boughta couple jackets in casus and otheritems in casesit's one of my favorite colors of thelemon has dropped recentlyand i bought the another mile jacket formy winter walking and running becausethat's something that i like to do tostay active soi do want to show you guys that thisjacket hereit does have two different layersthere's one inside and one outside sothe inside layer here which lululemoncalls adikinow i don't know why they call it dickybut hey that's what they call itthat is removable so this inside layerhere actually has the hood attached toityou can zip that out and it makes thejacket kind of a little cooler to wearin warmer temperatures and sometimes youjust don't want a hood because it'sannoying when you're runningor it gets in the way so you can goahead and take that part out if you'dlike to it just easilyzips out so one thing i do want tomention is that this jacket has anexcellent zipper i'm going to demo itfor you guysbecause i know in the past there havebeen zipper issues about lululemon andi've definitely experienced them tooso i'm just going to show you guys aquick demo of the zipper herei'm going to show you actually bothzippers because it does have twoso the insidethere we go and the outside zipper and iwant to say that these zippers are likereally nice um they're not cheapwhatsoever and they just glide up anddown there are no issues with any of thezippers on the jacketwhich is fantastic so i'm gonna go aheadactuallyand open it up again in a moment but iwanted to point out that there aretwo pockets on the front here thesepockets are decent size they candefinitely hold a smartphoneand um you know any kind of snacks oranything that you need in therei'm gonna go ahead and put somethingelse in there just to give you guysanother metric for you know what theycould holdall right so i've gone ahead and got astandard 500 milliliter water bottle toshow you guys how well that will fitinside this pocketall right so it does go in there i'd saythe water bottle is right at the zipperthereso it fits from here to here but thesepockets are definitely nice sizeso now i'm going to go ahead and unzipit show you guys the inside the insideof the jackethere so you can seekind of that separate zippering for theinside layerand i do want to mention that thisjacket does not have any inside pocketsso now i'm going to go ahead and flip itoverall right guys so this is what thejacket looks like from the backi do want to point out that there is alogo down here and there is nicereflectivity along the backi'm just going to turn on the flash soyou guys can see what it would look likewhen you're lit up so you can see thatnice reflectivity thereand it also has reflectivity on each ofthe sleevesso that is fantastic for you knowkeeping yourselfbeing illuminated when you are going outin those dark conditionsso now i'm going to go ahead and try onthis jacket so you can see what it lookslike on meso this is what the jacket looks like onmeit does have two pockets that are bothzipperedit has stump holesit also has a removable ditky hereand there is a logo down herei find the hood is um just kind ofaverage size it is definitely notum a huge hood all right guys so i'vegone ahead and removed the inner layeras you can see it hereand basically this is what it looks likewithout it it is um a littlekind of lighter and less insulatedbecause you do have this middle layertaken offso with the removable kind of dicky theinner layer gone i'd say thatit's more appropriate to wear it thisway in the spring because it'sdefinitely a little coolerand not as insulated now i'm going toshow you guys from the backso this is what the another mile jacketlooks likein natural lightingso one thing i wanted to mention aboutthis jacket the another mileis that it's very durable i have washedthis thingover 15 times so far since i've got itandit looks just as good as it did when ifirst got it there's nodiscoloration in the material it's justas kind ofsoft as it was originally and honestlythat's something important being able towash athletic item that you're runningin so i really appreciate that this justwash amazinglyi just put it in the washing machine onlowon the delicate cycle or low agitationon the cold water and i wear this atleast twice a weekfor the last five months so it'sdefinitely durable and it's holding upyeah so one thing about this jacket isthat it's very very warm it's excellentfor running or walking outside in thewinterbecause it keeps you warm this primaloftinstallation is amazingand the side panels here i'm goingacross the armand along the sides there are breathableso i do definitely sweat while i'mworking out while i'm running andwalkingand i haven't had you know any issueswith thatit keeps you warm even when you are wetand this jacket is not waterproof it'sjust water resistantbut i wear this in condition when it'ssnowy when it's cold out as well and ihaven't had any issueshonestly it does really well in the windone areakind of the zipper here wind sneaks inbut that's the only area of the jacketthat i ever have kind of an issuefeeling a little bit cold in because ofthe wind it just sneaks through thezipperi do want to say that this jacket isfantastic in cold weatherhonestly um when it's really really coldi can find myself wearing a t-shirt oreven a long sleeve underneath andi'm just fine i'm warm enoughso that just kind of tells you guys howwarm this jacket isi'm gonna go ahead and show you the tagfor anybody who would like to see thatso they say that it's base warmth buthonestly i think it's more of a mid-warmbecause this thing keeps me warmer thanthe downford all jacketpersonally after using them both i thinkthat this is a warmer than they'resaying it isand here's this information hereand once again um they do say it'swindproof butthey did not windproof the zipper areabecause wind sneaks in herelet me tell you it sneaks inand i really love that prima loftinstallationi think i actually like it better thandown because it's a lot more durableand it keeps me just as warm if notwarmer so i do want to mention becausethisis one of lou lemon's running jackets iwould not recommend it like as yourprimary winter jacket becausealthough it does have a good primaloftinsulation that insulation is meant tokind of thermal regulatewhen you're being active and keep you ata good temperature there it's not reallymeant for kind of walking around aseveryday winter jacket i think if youuse it as that you might be cold soi would recommend another jacket likemaybe the snow warrior parka if you arelooking for justa jacket to wear around in the winterbut if you're looking for something tobe active inthis is definitely a great option allright guys so considering the pricethe quality the performance um thedurabilityand everything like that i would goahead and give this jacket a 9.5 out of10.and i definitely give it a thumbs up andrecommend it to youso if you are interested in purchasingthe another mile jacket i've gone aheadand put a link in the description belowfor you to useall right guys so that's all i have foryou today about this another mild jacketonce again it's in the color casus in asize 14. thanks for watchingand make sure to like comment andsubscribe

hey guys so I recently went to New YorkCity for my friend's Christmas present Ibought us tickets to New York City Ilive in the Syracuse area when I'm homeso it's like a five-hour drive so Ibought us tickets to go to New York Cityfor Christmas present and I thought I'ddo a haul because I got a few thingswhile I was there and I had some thingsfrom before that trip that I had to showyou so I'm kind of just going to beadding in things I got before the tripwith the New York City stuff and Ithought I'd show you in a haul and it'sgonna be trying on cuz I know I forthose Tryon halls as you can tell I'mback in my room at home I'm home forlike another week before I were back tocollege as you can tell by the tapestryI know I'm gonna have questions it'sfrom eBayshe just searched tapestry on eBay abunch will come up and you can probablyfind this one also something I want tonote before I got in the hallI drove a lot of clothes as you can seeby all of my holiday aahs and I do notkeep all of those and I don't wear allof them which is bad I should butbecause of that I've been selling abunch of things on my Poshmarkespecially when I'm home from collegeI've just need to get rid of a lot ofthe stuff that I haven't been wearing soif you don't have a Poshmark accountbasically it's like an eBay just forlike clothes and accessories I swear I'mnot sponsored by them at all it's justlike a website or it's an app that a lotof people use you can also use that onthe computer but it's just reallyhelpful and it's great to buy stuff onI've bought so many things on Poshmarkfrom other sellers that I've beenlooking for for a lot cheaper anyways myuse anyone passport is Tasha for saj I'mgonna put that down below but if you donot have posh work I'll put my invitecode as well because you guys get like$10 I think when you sign up with it soyou could use that towards my stuff hinthintor like anything else I just figured I'dclip in there once again not sponsoredor anything but everyone gets one whenthey sign up so if you want to use mineand that would be awesomeokay so I'm gonna get into some thingsbefore I have the stuff from New York Ihave some stuff from Shia and romweand you guys helped me know that I havehauled from them numerous times in thepast and they always send me the itemsthey love working with youtubers and thething with the website is that they havea lot of really good items but they'revery questionable because a lot of thetime the images on their websites arenot the actual items so I get allexcited I'm like yeah I'm gonna workwith them they have some awesome piecesand then likein the mail and I'm like oh they're notthe same some of the stuff I do reallylike but some of the items I really donot like so just wanted to throw thatout there they sent me these things theydid not pay me to make this video but ifyou put in an ordering from Sheehan orromwe I definitely recommend being likeweary weary you said a word leery it'slike don't expect the things to lookexactly like the pictures and if youwant anything that I got at least you'llbe seeing them now so I'm gonna startoff with the stuff from she in Iactually don't like anything but um yeahby the way if I don't try any items oddit's because I really don't like howthey fit or I just don't like them ingeneral so that's why some things willbe try on and then some things won't beokay the first thing from Shion is thisblack and white dress and I would likeit except the material is a very odd itties in the middle I have a dress likethis but I wear all the time but thismaterial is like spandex II I don't knowit's kind of weird and it's likeawkwardly long on me this goes to likemy knee and this type of dress just onme a short person does not look cute tothe knees this next item from Shion Idon't hate it all I might keep this oneI don't remember what it looked like onso we'll see I think this one was alittle long too it's just like a t-shirtdress kind of thing it's long-sleevedgrey and white and the back was likecool cuz it's like a V cut once againI'm pretty sure this was a little bitlong but this is good material it'sthick it's nice this one's fine I justremember it not quite fitting how Iwanted to sew and Bronwen she and have alot of free people inspired items ontheir website and the thing is they'lluse the images from three people'swebsite so you never really know howthey're gonna turn out and I found a fewthings that are really great and thenthose things that are just not great soI got this dress that is nothing likethe three people one and I actuallywanted the three people one and so whenI saw this I'm like okay I'll try it outit's really not bad it's just thematerial that they use it's just likenot my favorite material and plus thisone like cinches in the front whereasthe real one doesn't once again too longon me too big on me not a baddress it has like some cute patternsit's just not flattering on me soprobably not going to keep this one thisnext dress would be cute if it was thesame color as the website it was like aburgundy kind of plum color on thewebsite but when I got it it was red soit's just it's really cute it's just notthe color that it wasn't the websitewhich is just annoying thing you looklike this back has some like opencutouts I'm just not a huge fan of redso if you like red this would be greatfor you I just I just didn't think itwould be bad last but not least I dolike this top it just fits on it'ssupposed to be like a top that wraps inthe front and you tie in the back and Ijust remember it fitting kind of weirdthere's nothing wrong with it yeah Idon't know it looks like this off andthen you're supposed to like tie thesethings around your body and tie them inthe back those are the artists machineshe inside I'm gonna link them all downbelow if you're interested in any ofthem okay moving on into romwe I do likea lot of this stuff there's a few thingsthat I don't like but for the majoritythis stuff was good okay first thingfrom runway I've won a few timesactually I really like it I think it'scute it's this navy blue sweater andthen it has like this little likesnowflake pattern on it it has a littlebit of a high-low hem which I like thesleeves are like this the next thingfrom runway is another hit it's one ofthose big scarves and this material isactually really soft it's still a bigplaid one like raw edge hem I think theworst thing that I got was this actuallydefinitely the worst thing first of allit was right on line I really like thosedresses that are like sheer on the topand then have like floral lace coveringthe boobs this is not at all what itlooked like it might show up a littleright on screen but I promise you thisis like neon pink and this likelightning oh god I don't know I reallydo not like this this material isn'tthat nicejust I don't know this part is nice ifthis was black it would be a lot betterit's just that it's neon pink and but itwas read online so yeah next thing I gotis this jacket it's not bad I'm justreally don't like it that much um lookslike this it's more the blaze there kindof thing it's really not bad it's justnot totally my style it has some likestitching going on and then back lookslike this next item is one of the threepeople look-alikes that actually works Ihave this in blue and I love it it's oneof my favorite dresses but I washed itand it shrunkI got it even dry I just put in thewasher and it shrunk up to a nice shirtso I went to go get the blue one againbut they didn't have it they only hadwhite so I got the white this is alittle bit long on me I got my last onehum but as you can see it looks likethis it's just like a shift kind ofdress and then it has like this floralembroidery neckline with like a reallyraw hem I don't think I've ever seen thepeople one person so I can't tell you ohit's exactly the same but the materialis definitely more of a free peoplematerial it's not that weird materiallike the other one I got this t-shirtdress this one I like more than theother one it's kind of like a ribbedmaterial I think it's gray and black I'mpretty sure that's black but it's juststriped 3/4 sleeves goes down this oneis a good length on me right where Iwant it and it's really cute so I likethis dress a lot I got a pair of jeansthat unfortunately do not fit me butthey're really nice jeans so they'relike a black kind of color really darkblue I don't really know but they havethose slits in the knees which is reallypopular home almost done I got this graysweater it's a really fuzzy kind ofthingamajig the sleeves look reallyshort I haven't tried this on actuallythe sleeves look really short kind ofsmells funny but you know you expectthat alrightsecond-to-last from romwe is thiscardigan I actually really like this Isaw this in someone else's video and Idecideit's like a cream color cardigan sleevesopen it some pockets house a hood andthen the back I really like cuz it likeis a different texture at the bottom Idon't know I thought this one was reallycute it looks cute doesn't smell weirdit's good okay last thing from romwe wasa pair of over the knee socks I justdon't know where I put them they'reblack over the knee socks they're good Iapprove so that's everything from thosestoressorry that was a ton of stuff they justsent me a ton of stuff which I don'twant to complain about but as you cansee it's really hit or miss so yeah okaymoving on to what I actually got in NewYork the first thing I got or a pair ofoh this which is crazy to me because Ihaven't worn Uggssince like ninth grade

welcome my name is Carolyn and bachaoI'm a Lululemon ambassador and I teachmeditation and yoga for everyone intoday's meditation we will exploreself-acceptance and ways to soften theharsh judgments that we have towardsourselves we'll go through someaffirmations and mantras to reallyremember the goodness that lies withineach and every one of us so grab acushion or a block and find acomfortable way to sit let's close oureyes and dive in take a nice big breathin and a cleansing breath out one moretime breathing in and outlet yourself arrive in a space of noeffort let your whole body start tosoften and let go just knowing for therethe next little while that we havetogether nothing's expected of youthere's no one special that you need totry and be it's really be in a space ofno effort feel the natural flow in andout of your breathand with each passing exhale let go ofany little knots or bits of tension thatyou might feel around your eyes your jawor your shoulderstake both your hands and place them onyour upper chest on your heart centerand take a few breaths right up intoyour palms right up into your heart thenobserve all the sensations around yourheart maybe it's been a while maybe it'sbeen a few hours or a few days sinceyou've really taken the time to check inwith your heartand in many Buddhist schools ofmeditation this kind of self inquiry isvital to really look in to how you'refeeling to honestly assess how you'refeeling so for a moment ask yourselfhow's my heartobserve what arises with gentleness andtendernessmaybe you're feeling a little bit sadmaybe there's some stress or anxietyaround your heart perhaps fear perhapsworry blame perhaps you're alreadyfeeling quite light and joyful in yourheart take it all in never pushing anyof your feelings awayfor the remainder of the meditation andyou're welcome to keep your hands onyour upper chest whatever you feeldisconnected from yourself whenever youfeel lost in discursive thought or yourhands can come back down into your lapone Buddhist teacher he says that it'struly in our places of vulnerability andin the places where we think that we'refailing is where we can truly learnabout self-acceptance and self-care it'sin our spaces of discomfort that welearn how to healso I'd like you to think about a way inwhich you get down on yourself a way inwhich you judge yourself it's verycommon for many people to be hard onthemselves and we really want to changethose patterns so go into the patternitself and think for a moment on a waythat you judge yourself notice how itfeels in your stomach and in your breathI know how uncomfortable it can be toreally face the ways in which we don'tthink we're good enough just remember togreet these judgments these self-doubtswith kindness this is a practice ofinquiry and we're really working tochange and shift these patterns you cankeep that in the back of your mindnow bring to mind a mentor or a wiseteacher or a dear friend and think aboutsome words of guidance they would offerto you knowing how hard you can be onyourself what would that wise person sayto you perhaps my friend you're goodenoughperhaps you can just relax as you areor perhaps dear friend soften thishardness around your heart everything'sokaynotice how you feel when you think aboutthese words of consolation a dear friendwould say to youthere is so much goodness underlyingthis current of discursive thoughtthere's so much goodness within all ofus but circumstances in life anddifferent situations that we go throughand have to endure I kind of cover overthis goodness so that we forgetgive yourself a couple of minutessitting here relaxed in the jaw theshoulders and breathe in these words ofkindness from your friend or your mentormy friend you're good enoughrelax as you are right nowyou may find that your thoughts arejumping all over the place into the pastand into the future you may find thatyou're judging yourself for having thesekind of jumbled thoughts that's justsomething else to welcome in and topractice acceptance towards welcome inall that you are and all that you'vebeen through what really creates troublefor us is when we try to block outthings that we don't like aboutourselves or when we try to numb thepainremembering that all that you are allthat you are is so important in thisworld there's no one else like you noone else that's been through what you'vebeen through and it's in our challengesand in our vulnerabilities that we cantruly learn about ourselves and aboutself love and acceptanceas we finish our meditation together youmight make a very small commitment toyourself to write down these words ofcaring to write down this affirmationthat a dear friend or teacher would sayto you when you're hard on yourself andreturn to these kind words in hardmoments the practice of self acceptanceis ongoing because our patterns are sostrong to be hard on ourselvesthank your heart for all it

Simon chain manager of corporatetechnology at Lululemon okay so ifyou're at a party and people find out tohere to fear leader Lululemon how oftendo people ask me giving discount clothesup every time I get a sense that thatleaves when you've got this incrediblystrong culture in a culture ofinnovation and and you know I culturedon't want to get things done and helppeople tell me about the culture yeahit's really important the thing aboutLulu Lemon is once you come to ouroffice you'll realize that everybody isso willing to work with each othereverybody's so open-minded andtransparent we're not afraid to giveother feedback and we'll also take iteither right and you'll realize thatreally quickly that the technology thatwe put in it in line to that experiencewe're trying to not interrupt the peoplerelationship in the aspects of that andwe're trying to put technology in placeso that we facilitate it and make iteasier and more effective well as I lovethat here you're talking about how doesthe technology build on it even furtherthe collaborative open transparentculture that lululemon have that's rightand as we're increasing is globally thatpiece is really important lululemon isexpanding at the radiance expandingwhat's your biggest challenge yeah ourbiggest challenge would be to make surewe enable and empower our users to workthe way they want to work across theworld there are tiny differences betweeneach regionand we need to be aware of all thedifferent changes or all the differentapplications that may be used in theorganization and as part of that andthat's why we made as investment azuread is to enable us from an identity andaccess and point to do that and a fromSCCM and into perspective allow us toallow the user to get a winner tend tobite and be able to actually joinanywhere in the world what can I do tosupport the changing needs of them abusiness like you know you have moreMillennials come in what can I do tobetter enable them yeah I think there'sa term of shadow I've seen on andthere's a negative connotation to it Idon't want to bug it that way yesbecause I know your dog is pretty goodyeah well the way I think about it isit's an education opportunity for melike the way I look at it is we'vealready communicated what products wehave internally so there must be areason it goes around me so for me islet's try and understand why what is itabout the product that they're usingthat they don't want it is mine rightand that's okay right at the end a day Icould go hey you know let's worktogether and try and secure this andallow it usable data enterprise levelthe other thing that we like to thinkabout is you know it's also aboututilization and investment right so weinvest in Azure ad we noted capabilitywe know what to secure otherapplications identity and whatnot so whyare we not flexing that muscle yes ifyou want to know what your users want golook at what they're using what they'redoing yeah there's no there's no betterdefinition than that you go to visityour alma mater your college okay matterwhat advice would you give thosestudents be in someone else's shoesdon't even buy that think about howsomeone else you can react I think thiscomes from the fact that I'm trying todesign user environment and a lot oftimes system ends or sis engineers goyou know that's so simple you know it is57 clicks but you know like it makessense to us as we're designing theproduct but at the end of the day it'sall about simplicity and it's about gooduser experience what advice would yougive me reading the teams that i read

hey guys so first of all oMG I'm wearingglasses to film a video I haven't wornglasses to form a video ever I don'tthink maybe very very early on basicallyI hate wearing my glasses I have to wearthem this week because I'm getting myeyes lasered next week after which Ihopefully will not have to wear glassesagain but it means I have to wearglasses this week and I'm gonna try andfilm some videos without them but thisone I'm just gonna have them on andwe'll see how it goes so today is goingto be part two of my kind of us haul Iasked you guys in my previous video ifyou wanted to see these holes alltogether or if you want to separate onesand most people said separate so you'regoing to have three whole videos in arow and no that seems excessive if youdon't like cool videos then you can haveto come back next week for somedifferent Beauty content but if you dolike cool videos you got lucky this weekso I'm going to start off with thefashion and bits and bobs so alreadydone my Sephora haul if you haven't seenthat a link at the end and on FridayI'll be doing my drugstore haul I'mgonna start in the order of which Ibought these things I know that kind ofdoesn't make sense sometimes I feel likeI should put the best things at thebeginning or save the best things tolast but I don't know I just feel likedoing them in order so the first thing Ididn't actually buy when I was in theStates this is something I bought aboutwhat week ago about a week before I leftand I wanted to show it to you guysbecause I'm quite obsessed with it it'sfrom Topshop and it's this tasseledsnake skin clutch now I don't normallylike snake skin I really am NOT a fan ofit on clothing but I really like it inthis because I think it's a kind of nicemixture with the suede tassel Ingeobsessed with tassels right now and alittle bit of snake skin on the rest ofthe bags they're quite like snake skinaccessories but yeah not so much theclothes but I really like this I'mactually going to Coachella oh my god soexcited in April and I thought thiswould be like the perfect kind offestival vibe it also has a strap whichI can show you in here I'm not really abig fan of the strap it's quite a gaudygold colour what I might do is try andsteal one of the straps of my recommendcuff bags because I have some reallynice chain straps on there that I thinkmight just be a little nice so like thisis a bit of a shiny gold I don't know Iprefer as a clutch anyway so this wasfrom Topshop when I believe it's about38 pounds so yes big fan of thatmoving on to stuff that I actuallybought whilst I was in the States thefirst thing I got is from UrbanOutfitters I very very rarely shop inUrban Outfitters now I used to a fewyears ago but now I feel like it's mostof the stuff in there is that kind ofnineties style which I love but not onmy finger so I picked up this dress Ispotted it it was like right at thefront of the shop was like an absolutelylove that print I've been obsessed withthe kind of dark florals recently if youguys have seen any of my kind of outfitof the days in the last few weeks I'vebeen wearing quite a lot of that kind offloral print but with black as the maincolor I just think it's a nice kind ofmedium between the girly floral andkeeping it a little bit more edgy soit's a basic cotton sleeveless dress itis quite voluminous so it's quite likeshapeless I would definitely belt thisunless I was wearing it like on thebeach as a beach cover-up I think it'sreally really pretty it has a button-upall the way down the front and it has astructured collar really nice and it'squite soft I think this was quiteexpensive I find an open outfit is to bealways more expensive than I think it isit's cheaper in the States this is $70so what is that about fifty five fiftypounds no less than that about fortyfive pounds something like that so yeahI really like it I think I'll get a lotof wear out of it in the summer and likeI said I'm going to Coachella in April Ithink I'll definitely be taking thatwith me next I popped in to forever 21first thing I got are some sunglasseswhich I'm going to take off the label soyou guys can see them better basicallyI've been thinking about this sunglassvessel in Burberry for the last like sixmonths I tweeted a picture of them andall those people said they hated themand I know that shouldn't matter like ifI love them that's all that matters butit's kind of put me off buying them so Isaw these in forever 21 for like $5 andthey're a similar style so I thought youknow if everyone's gonna hate them maybeI should just get the cheaper ones sothat I don't feel so bad about likesplashing out the cash or where theseones and see if I really really likethem then perhapsinvest in the more expensive ones anywaythey look like this ifI thought these would be good forfestival wear because I always find itfestivals you can't now I can't seeanything so I take my glasses off sowhat do they look like I find theirfestivals I always like to take my chiefof sunglasses just in case I lose themor anything because they're quite aneasy thing to lose things like that Imight fall off your head or whatever butyeah so those are from forever 21 andthen I also picked up another kind ofspring summery style dress which wasfrom forever 21 and it is this denimit's almost like a tie-dye or like amixed wash denim it's very very mottledit's a loose-fitting long shirt dressand it has this faux suede lik typeplaited tie around the waist and yeah Ihave something fairly similar to thisthat I got from Zara about it must bealmost almost 10 years old I think theone I have from Zara and I still wear itI saw really liked it but it's a littlebit shortwhereas this I feel like you can wearthis kind of out and about because ithits like just above the knee whereasthe Zara one is really short so unlessit's a really hot summer day or you'regoing to the beach or you know you're ona beach holiday I'm usually don't wearit unless I'm wearing with like leggingsor something whereas this I thought youcould wear without leggings and notworry about it being too short has therolled-up sleeves really like this andit was 32 dollarsso around 20 pounds I thought that was agood buy next up I went to free peopleand I don't often buy a lot of thingsfrom free people but I was with my momand it was the first time she'd everbeen in there and she was just so takenby it she absolutely loved the shop fromlike everything about it and they dohave it in England now but again asusual with American brands it's a lotmore expensive in England so I picked uptwo things from three people this timeand the first one I'm trying to get thestraps like straight the first one is areally loose fitting tank top reallylike this style of straps it's somethingthat River Island did this or last yearthey brought out and I think they'restill doing it as these little strappytops with the extra straps at the frontI think it's a really kind of cutedetail it's a very simple thing to dobut what I like about this one is thatit goes over to the book I just droppeda strap is that it goes over to the backas well so it's like a feature on theback the front is like a crossover styleso it's almost so it's almost like Idon't know just a really like pretty rapdetail and the material is super softfree people is not the cheapest placewas 38 so around 25 ish pounds but Ithink you'll get a lot of wear up soit's really nice basic and then the nextthing I picked up from three people wasactually in the sales sectionI don't normally find a huge amount ofstuff in the sales section there becausea lot of it is just the really bizarrestuff that nobody follows but I triedthis on on a bit of a whim and Iactually really really love it againit's a black kind of Jersey strappy topbut it has really beautiful triple strapkind of design and a low v-neck frontwith a kind of attachment and then theback is even lower I think you have towear either like a bandeau top or abikini top underneath this because it isquite revealing but it's quite long so Ifeel like it would look really cute withlittle denim shorts or a little denimskirt and it has a little waist belt aswell I thought this was really cute itwas reduced from $100 to $50 so around30 pounds which I think it's good it'sgot quite a lot of embellished detailson it which I really really love a lotyeah so I was really happy without myfamily in the sale then I picked up acouple of workout things from LululemonI loved Lululemon again they just openedone in the UK or last summer they'refrom one in the UK and it is soexpensive but I just wouldn't buyanything from there in the UK but in theStatesI like to kind of get a couple of thingswhen I go over my other stuff that I'vegot from there has lasted for years I'vehad it for like two years and it stilllooks brand-new the quality is amazingso I picked up a couple of things fromthere first are these workouts tightsthey're not the cropped ones they'rekind of the 3/4 I do have a longer pairfrom Lululemon but they tend to be a bittoo long because I'm 5 3 so I'm quiteshort not really short but just a bitshort and yeah they tend to be a bitlong for me so I like the 3/4 ones fromthere and I really like these onesbecause they have the diagonal kind ofblack style on the back of the calfwhich I really like I'm not sure on thename of thesebut I got them in a size six which is aUK ten I really like them camera stylelove those a lot and then I got this topwhich I did leave the tag on this onethis is the wilds tank and I got this inthe same size and this one is likebusiness in the front and then likemajor party in the back so it has like abuilt-in sports bra with about a millionstraps on the back and then it has thatopen back slightly more revealing thanmy usual workout clothes but somethingabout this I just really liked Iactually had a look on the websitebefore I went out to the states and Ihad my eyes specifically on one of thesebecause I just think they're so cutethey look so pretty when they're on andyeah I really like material as well it'squite a long fit so the back almostcomes down to cover your bum which Ilike if you're wearing tight tights likethis because it's just a bit more Idon't know covered up probably wouldn'twear these together and might might be abit too much wearing them together Iprobably wear these with black or thetop with black bottoms and then thiswith like a plain top probably but yes Iwas super happy with those and I spentages in the lemon I was with my mum shehates exercise gear and all of that soshe was like super super bored final twothings that I picked up were fromNordstrom and the first thing is abracelet which I just think this issuper super gorgeous I love itit is a gold bangle and it's made withwire so it's slightly flexible but ithas these gold arrowheadsthey're almost like I don't know whatlike ethnicity they would be but youknow like handmade arrowheads that aremade from like slate and stone and stuffthey're in that shape but they're goldthis was $44 so it was quite expensiveit was from Nordstrom so they're kind ofjewelry ranges that they stock generallyare a bit more pricey than your averagehigh street stuff I'm not sure on thebrand of this it has like a little tagwhich looks like it says BB but I don'tthink it's bah-bah-bah I'm gonna do aclose-up of this so you guys can seeanyway but I really really like it I'lltry and find an- link for it if you guys like it andwant to buy it I'll try and find a linkand put it below it so you got actuallyknow that what make it is because I'mnot sure but I really like it a lot Ithink I'll wear this a lot over the nextcouple of months it's quite a summerykind of beachy vibe really like it andthen last but not least is the kind ofsplurge item of the trims kind of anaughty purchase it is from RebeccaMinkoff I've been obsessed with tasselsrecently and as you guys know I boughtthat Topshop tassel bag and when I sawthis I just absolutely fell in love withit and thought it would be perfect forthe summer and I love Rebecca Minkoffbags as well because they're greatquality for the price I think they'reprobably the best quality bags aroundthat aren't super super expensive but itlooks like this it's just a very plainblack tassel bag this is actually thefront which has little recomment offplates on it but I think I prefer theother side just a plain one like thateither way it's a really cute kind ofcrossbody or over the shoulder leathertassel bag it's quite small but what Ifound with the Rebecca Minkoff bags isthat they are deceptively roomy in termsof keeping stuff in them this one is alittle bit smaller than mini Mac so Ithink it won't be as good on that frontbut again perfect for summer travelingdefinitely going to be taking this tokatella yeah and love it it actuallysmells amazing as well you know you getsomething that's really really beautifulquality leather and it just smellsreally lovely yes super super happy withthat I think it's gonna be a wardrobestaple this year so that's it for thisvideo I hope you guys enjoyed it like Isaid before I'm going to be doing

hey guys what's up so I'm back againwith another legging review video B Jimshark legging review videos seem to bereally really popular and I have peoplehad a lot of follow-up questions to thatreview so I figured what I would do is Iwould break down the leggings that I dohave that actually do prefer over thegym shark leggings that I did purchaseand I will link that review to the gymshrek liking review here there will belike a little card for you guys and youcan click on that if you don't know whatI'm talking about also link it in thedescription box down below for you guysyou can check that one out but basicallyI'm going to give you guys a comparisonof the gym shark leggings versus Nikeleggings and I have three differenttypes of Nike leggings that I want tocompare it to and then also Lululemonleggings as well and I only have onekind of Lululemon leggingso one style but I will be showing youguys how it compares across the boardJim shark Nike and Lululemon I hope youguys enjoyed the review video if youguys have any questions commentswhatever just please leave them in thecomment section down below or feel freeto reach out to me on any of my socialmedia platforms but yeah thank you somuch for watching guys and I hope youguys enjoyed the video if you aren'tsubscribed already please make sure yousubscribe to you don't miss out onvideos like this one and yeah so here wego okay guys so the first leggings thatI'm going to pretty much show you guysare the Lululemon Lu high time luanpants and their these are the 7/8 typeof pants so that's their cut is a 7/8 sothey are and they do retail for $98 onthe Lululemon web site and in store andalso another thing is that they arelittle tiny bit see-through now theseare like navy blue color but if you goand you get like black they're fine um Idon't have any issues with the black onebut there are a little sheernot gonna lie but the fit is a very veryhuggable if you go and you see like theyhave a no dig type of waist man which iscompletely true I don't feel like I getmuffin top with these I don't feel likethey accentuate my kangaroo pouch beadsin terms of the tummy control I wouldprobably give these about maybe like an8 out of 10 which is saying somethingbecause if you have a little bit of atummy it is always an issue to find highrise leggings that don't accentuate itmore verses you know situating it lessso they are $98 they do have a hiddenpocket inside which is great and theyhave flat seams on the inner side theonly issue that I have with these isthat if you have that rub against eachother you will get pilling which arethose like little ball type of things onthe leggings and that's a huge issuebecause they are very like spandex styleso if you have anything that rubsagainst them they're going to get thatpilling and that's annoying but the goodthing about it is that Lululemon has areally really great return policy soanytime that that happens you can easilyreturn them so these next leggings arethe gym sharp dry sculpture leggingsthey retail for $43 on the website andthe biggest issue with these is one thesizing is weird on the website I am amedium in these particular leggings butI was told I could have been anywherebetween a small and a medium so it'skind of like up in the air in terms ofsizing I mean they're they feel kind ofum kind of like a spandex couple timesthat I wore them I did feel kind of likean itchy kind of sensation and I'mwondering if that's due to the meshsiding on the really coolthey do have that side pocket which Iwas told that other legging companiesalso have that so apparently in sign abig deal the biggest issue is how sharethey are and if you see here I purposelywore underwear with wording on thembecause they're completely sheer so ifyou are squatting in the gym shark drysculpture leggings just keep that inmindthat they are very sheer you saw it Ishowed you on their $43 which you'rethey're actually the cheapest of the allthe leggings that I will be showing youbut they don't have a like no dig kindof waistband like the Lululemon's dothey definitely accentuate your tummy ifyou do have one and they do accentuatelike muffin top and things like thatwhich I didn't preferably like now interms of tummy control these literallyprobably I would give them a 1 out of 10they don't have any tummy controlwhatsoever they're high waisted leggingsbut they don't have any type of tummycontrol in that waistband so it'ssomething to keep in mind but thefollowing ones are the Nike 2.0 Legendthese are the capri or crop style ofleggings so these are just shorterleggings now the 90 2.0 legend they'renot sheer and these are actually greatthe one thing I love about Nike is thatthey always have some type of patternsome type of just intricate design ontheir leggings is a very on trend and sothat's great about them now these Ialways purchase Nike Lite like Nikeleggings on their clearance section Inever never pay full price for them Ijust refused to because these legendTyson limited sub will check can retailanywhere from $90 which is like one ofthe you know on the higher end but youcan easily find them and I'm looking atone right now for about $64 and ninetyand since but I always wait for them tohave like that 20 extra 20 percent offclearance and if you aren't signed upfor Nikes newsletter you should sign upbecause then you get an extra 20 percentoff of that and it ends up being aboutfifty or so dollars which is still alittle bit more expensive than I guessyour gym trip lugging but the materialis like night and day the this one Iliterally in terms of tummy controlwould give it probably anywhere fromlike an 8.5 to like us I would sayanywhere from like a 7.5 to an 8.5they're really really good and they'renot technically high waisted leggingsbut they can they they can go up for meparticular because of my height andweight they can go up to about a highwaisted style now the next style thatyou're going to see here are just thesamethey're the nike legendary 2.0 type butthese are the actual pull pants and thisis a different style again I got theseon clearanceI paid probably at the most 64 dollarsfor these and they are hardly sheer theonly parts that are sheer on them that Iwould say would be the white parts umbut the design actually makes up forthat because no you know when you seethe design you're going to notice andI'm going to show you guys that thedesign makes it so that it's not verynoticeable if you're wearing underwearthat has like prints or anything likethat on it now again tummy control Iwould give these anywhere from an 8.5 uphonestly because they're not meant to behigh waisted pants or high waistedleggings but they can because of the wayI'm built or my height they are verylike I can just pull them up and they'reperfectly fine I don't feel like in anytimes that I'm working out and I've doneburpees I've done CrossFit styletraining I've done the only thing Ihaven't done in these is probably brandlike long distance running but Iwouldn't recommend these particularanswer that anyway now the next leggingsthat you're going to see are the Nikelegendary sculpt tight pants which arehigh waisted and they are meant to behigh waisted and these probably have atummy control of like a 9.5 and abovethese are a medium I have a large aswell in them and I finally got a mediumI got B's in outlet store and I paidless than I paid less than $50 for theseand they can retail anywhere from $100to 110 dollars depending on what youknow what kind of deals Nike is havingso full pricing retail anywhere from$100 for you but I paid about 50 or sodollars tummy control is through theroof on knees you're going to literallyfeel sucked in the best thing aboutthese is they do not have a like thatthe they have like a very like they'rethey're not sheer at allthey are very opaque I can squattinthese and regardless of whatever colorunderwear or whatever you know patternsor whatever I have on the on them likethey're fine they're not I don't lookcrazy they definitely don't give youthey like calm down that muffin top thatif you do have a muffin top and this isgoing to slim you down now keep in mindthat this medium fits me actually veryvery tight but the reason why I got themedium was because one I am leaning downbut to my largest getting a little bitloose at the top where your see likeright where my hands areit is getting loose right there at thetop so I decided to go with a mediumjust in case because I feel like after awhile after a few washes after a fewuses these will definitely get likestretch out at first they're going to bevery very tight and you could see youknow if you're really really payingattentionand you know if you're not wearing likethe right underwear as you coulddefinitely see that these will havepanty lines on them but there are greatpants out of all of them and to becompletely honest with you guys out ofall of these tights my top choices arelittle lemon high time pants becausethey just have a different type of fit Imean my only pet peeve is the pillingbut they definitely have a differenttype of fit and I like the 7/8 quartercut on them because they're not Caprithey're not cropped but they're also nota full pant so I do like that and I dolike that they're higher waisted then mysecond one would be probably the 90sculpt type pant and that is justbecause they're high waisted they havethat tummy control they're great pantsthe only thing is that they can be alittle bit long on per se but if you'retaller than me then you should be finethe third would be the Nike legend 2.0just because those aren't made highwaisted but their tummy control isseriously like through the roof on pointbut I do find myself having to pull mypants up a little bit more because theyaren't meant to be a high waisted tightnow the last of the bunch is definitelythe gym short ones unfortunately and Ican't return them because I've used themand I've squatted and dead lifted andthat you know and they're just not theydon't meet the bill between any of themso my recommendations guys I really hopethat you enjoyed the review I hope itwas informative if you have anyquestions or any follow-up questionsplease leave them in the comment sectiondown below and yeah anyways thank you somuch for watching please don't forget tosubscribe and like and share the videoand

hi everyone its veronika welcome back tomy Channel today I have a new video foryou guys and it is my Lululemon halt andtell me what you guys think about thequality because I did get a new cameraso I don't really know if that makesthat big of a difference because I'm notlike showing you guys products so it'snot gonna be like autofocus and thingslike that but it might be a little bitbetter than my iPhone camera I don'treally know but yeah just tell me whatyou guys think in the downbar and yeahso I just went shopping at Lululemonlast week and I found some prettyamazing clothes and the only reason whyI'm titling this like a huge Lululemonhaul is because whenever I go to alittle M in to buy clothes I normallyjust buy one or two things because ofhow expensive it is but um I bought thisall in one shopping trip so yeah mywallets crying a little bit but I was sohappy and I got so many cute clothes andthese were all on discount so I was veryhappy and yeah let's just get startedby the way I'm gonna be tryingeverything on so hopefully you guys canget a better idea of the product I'mgonna show you guys and yeah by the wayI wear a size two most of the time andsometimes I'll get a for everything inthis haul is a size two so yeah so thefirst thing that I got was actually thisbra and it's just blue and black stripedand this is actually one of their newercolors it just came up with a springcollection and it was so cute I just hadto get it and on the back it's just likeblack and blue turquoise yeah straps andthis is just the free to be wild bra andthis was $48 and I think that their brasare probably one of my favorite thingsfrom them because of the material in thequality and their warranty is so good soyeah I think this is a great investmentand if this years ago a word I rarelywear normal bras anymore so I love thisso much and it's cute over bra and thisis just um the same one free to be wildand then this was actually on clearancethis was 38 is 39 instead of 48 so yeahthis is just like a watercolor greycolor and I have like pinky and purplecolors in the the straps on the back arejust red Annie I think this is also verycute and it fits the exactly the sameexcept it's just a little bit cheaperI've got two pairs of pants these arethe speed tight I think that's whatthey're called the speed tight foursand I love the speed tides they fit whenbetter than the Wonder unders and theseare like my favorite pants from Lulaexcept these are very very pricey Ithink these are like 108118 something like that so they are alittle bit more expensive but I just gotthem in a bright purple color becauseall my Lulu's are black so I was likewhy not just step out of my comfort zoneand this wrong sales so hey why notright so yeah I really like these andsomething that's really unique aboutthis be tight is that they have pocketsgoing through the side so yeah in mytrial and I'll show you guys and theseare crazy high waisted so yeah but umyeah these make your butt look good eventhough I do not have a butt and by theway the main reason why I bought so manyLululemon is because I want to get fitlike I want to work out and get toned sothat is a goal of mine but it's notreally happening like I tried to do the30 day but challenge but I only did liketwo or three days out of the entire 30so I'm gonna work harder next month butyeah we'll see so they're actuallyseparating their pants into likedifferent sensations or something so Ihave like the little sheet of paper thisis actually the hugged one and they havelike tight held in naked and relaxed sothey have like different styles now andI like these ones and the material isalso a little bit different so yeah Ilove them and then my next pair of pantsare just these really cute turquoiseones these are actually cropped and yeahI like these and I love to in the flowline because the material is like supersuper thick and this one is like crazyhigh-waisted so when I wear them Inormally like to roll them down a littlebit because otherwise I can't reallybreathe but I like this a lot doesn'treally make your butt look good kind ofthis but but I don't really know it justlike sucks everything in kind of so itdoesn't really like emphasize your buttit just kind of blinds it so yeahwhateverand there's also like really cuteruching on the sides of these andbecause my legs are a little bit longerthese cut off at the knees so yeahthat's kind of a bummer because they'renormally supposed to go at mid um calfso yeah and just in case like you guysdon't know what size to get I have a 24inch waist and I normally got like a 30to 33 length so yeah hopefully you guysfind that helpful like when decidingwhat size you should get but I reallylike these and yeah I like them a lotactually forgot to mention the price ofthe purple pants but they wereoriginally 108 or 118 and I only paid$90 so I got like 20 $30 off which isvery rare and one lemon so I was veryhappy the in the flow proper originally7and I only paid 49 so these were a greatdeal they were only $50 for Lu which isgreat and yeah I love the color they areperfect for summer and perfect forworking out or just lounging around thehouse in and then the next thing I gotwas just this tank top and this is justthe salute the Sun tank and these lookgreat with the free to be bronzed theseare my favorite tank tops from the lemonI have these in so many different colorsand it's just very very loose and flowyit's like the typical workout tankexcept I do like this more because ofthe quality even though it's so then youcan tell that they made this with careand yeah it's really nice because in theback I like how the racerbackis a little bit skinnier and you can seethe little Lululemon emblem and insigniawhat am I saying I absolutely love howthere's a little hole in the back so youcan really show off your bra and I thinkit's so cute and it also adds a lot oflike ventilation especially if you'resweating and another thing that's kindof cool is that the bottom actuallyopens up so you can either get a nicerview over the butt or you could just tieit up and make it a little bit morecropped but I love this tank top this isjust an army green color and yeah thistank top was originally 54 and I onlypaid 39 so yeah I had to get it the lastthing in this haul is actually thist-shirt and this is just the swiftlytech t-shirt these are absolutely myfavorite shirts from Lulu becausethey're so so comfortable and they havelike air holes so you can like let yourskin breathe especially when you'reworking on used to wear these to gogolfing all the time and I just got thisin a really cute coral color and thiswas actually full price also but I'm notgoing to be trying this on because I'vegot a size 10 and not a size 2 but it'sokay and I'm just gonna exchange it butthere's like a little on insignia goinglike through the shirt I'll try to likeshow that here can you guys see that Idon't only know but I really like thecolor and it is perfect for summer andthese fits so nicely because they likereally hugged your body so yeah I reallylike this and this goes great with abunch of other things so I really hopeyou

hey everyone so today I am filming aLululemon collection and I know thatLululemon has become increasinglypopular over the past few years andthere aren't too many stores across thecountry so shopping online is probablyone of the easiest ways to get yourhands on some of these items so Ithought this video might be helpful forthose of you who have been interested inpurchasing from this brand and this wayyou can kind of know my thoughts on thepieces and also I know that Lululemon iskind of on the more pricey side ofthings especially in concerns to activewear but for me it made sense to investsome of my money into these piecesbecause I do live a pretty activelifestyle I recently just finished myfirst half marathon so that was excitingand I like to transition a lot of thesepieces into my daily wardrobe so if I'mjust running errands or slashing aroundthe house I'm pretty much always wearingsome Lululemon article of clothingbecause they're just so comfortable andthey don't show wear so yeah with thatlet's get into it ok so let's start offwith some of the more accessory typeitems one of my favorite things to buyfrom lemon are headbands and especiallythe flyaway tamer headbands they're justbasic thick headbands but they have likelittle sticky dots on the inside of themso they really hold back all of yourlittle flyaway hairs hence the nameflyaway tamer and I have them in a bunchof colors just because I love them thatmuch and they don't stretch which isreally great and these are $14 I haveall the prices listed on my iPad that Icould find online so that is why I'mlooking down sometimes and then next upI have this headbands I just have one ofthese it's called this wasn't onlinebecause it is one of their more winterpieces and it like goes over your earsthat was great visualization but it goesover your ears to keep them warm and Ithink this is around 30 $40 andI really like this for the winter andthen for sports bras I just have to andthey're actually the same ones I have inblack and I also have it in pink andthese are called the energy bra and theywere 48 dollars and they have a reallycute crisscross detailing in the backand they say online that this givesmedium support and I would agree withthat and the last like accessory typething are their underwear and this isthe light as air thong and this was $16so that is kind of pricey for thongs butthese are so so comfortable they're madeof really nice material that's reallythin and breathable so you won't haveany sweaty gross sness down there if youknow what I meanand they also don't have any seams so ifyou just want to wear these under like atight dress these are definitely theunderwear for thatmoving on to pants Lululemon makes byfar the best leggings I have ever wornin my life and I have a bunch ofdifferent leggings from a bunch ofdifferent brands so I kind of know likewhat I'm looking for in leggings andthese are just amazing um so the firstpair I have are these and these are justthe most basic full-length leggings andblack and these are called the WonderUnderpants and they are 82 dollars andfor size reference I'm a size 4 in allof the Lululemon bottoms and normally injeans I'm a size 24 or 25 and then likewith all of the leggings from the lemonthey have a little triangle in thecrotch which is great because you do nothave to worry about getting a camel toebecause those are really disgusting andvery unwelcome so that's great and Ilove wearing these just in everyday wearum they are thick enough so that you canget away with wearing them in publicwithout people being like whoa you werewearinglike cheap little tights girl like whatare you doing so yeah I just love theseand then I also have another pair butthe only difference of these is thatthese are full luan and full the onebasically just means that it's linedwith a little bit of a heavier materialand it kind of feels like fleece sothey're a little bit warmer than theones without them and then I also havethe wonder under crop but these arereversible and these were 82 dollars sothey're just cropped black leggings butyou can also wear them on the inside onthe pink side the next crops I have toshow you are by far my favorite pantsever so I mean I love all the leggingsfrom Lululemon all the bottoms but thesespecific pants are just my favorite everand these are what they look likethey're just black and these are calledthe run and Speier crop to block itpocket and these are $92 so I knowthey're really pricey but honestlythey're completely worth it they are soso so comfortable when you wear them Iwore these for my half marathon and fortraining in them they're just sobreathable and the material is so thinand lightweight that when you wear themit feels like you're running butt-nakedI mean who doesn't want to feelbutt-naked like tell me do you want tobe wearing pants no if you had an optionbetween wearing pants and not wearingpants I'm pretty sure you would chooseto not wear pants these pants are justthe best of both worlds I mean I just Icannot say enough good things about themif you're an avid workout person youdefinitely need these in your life Ialso have them in a different versionthey're obviously pink and they are madeup of small black and gray stripes whenyou see them up close and have a cutelittle detailing at the bottom and theyalso have the pocket in the back butthese are a little bit different andthey're called the run inspired crop tooand these are $86 and unlike the blackpair that they're supposed to becomparable to these have a little bit ofa thicker and like spandex image hereand they do not have the mesh detailingon the back of the legs that the blackperiod have so the black pair have likethis mesh that keeps you really cool inthe places that you would normally getreally sweaty and these don't and then Ihave two pairs of shorts and I haven'trun these yet because the weather herehas just gotten hot enough to wear themduring the morning that's when Inormally run and the first pair I haveare just black shorts these are calledthe in a flash short and these were 58dollars and they have spandex on theinside to prevent chafing I guess I'mnot like the biggest fan of that butit's a nice little thing to have andthen these are just lavender and theseare called the tracker short too andthese were $54 and unlike the black pairshorts I showed you these have a builtin underwear instead of spandex which Iwill probably cut out or somethingbecause I don't know I don't really likebuilt-in underwear I think it's kind ofgross so yeah and these have a littlezipper which is cool and then last butnot least I'm going to be showing you mytops in my jackets that I have I justhave two jackets from Lululemon becausethey are quite pricey and I don't reallyrun that much in jackets so yeah thefirst one I have is this and I got thislast winter so I couldn't find it onlinebut I believe this was around $100 and Ihave seen them in the stores cents butjust in different colors and yeah I'msure they're going to relaunch this inthe winter because it was quite apopular item it's just a half zipsweater and the zip is kind of weirdlike I don't know it's just it'sinteresting and then it also has a bigpocket on the back and this material isso like comfy to wear when you'rerunning and then the bottom of it has amesh detailing so it keeps your armpitscool and then I have this jacket andthis is so cute this is the newest one Ijust bought in spring so they do stillhave these in stores and then everythen they come out with different likestyles with us and different colors andthis is called the nice a sauna jacketand this is $118 so I know pricey butworth it and this is a full length zipand I got both of these jackets is inthe end of size eight because I likehaving my jackets being a little bitbigger the last thing that I have toshow you are all tops and they're allmade out of the same material and thefirst one is this long-sleeve shirt Irecently show this in a haul so youshould be able to still get this on lineor in the stores and this is called therun swiftly Tek long sleeve scoop andthis was $68 and I got the città sizefour because it's supposed to fit snugbut not too snug and I just found thatthe size four fit me the best and andfor your curiosity uh-hum I normallywear a size small and other brands andwhat makes this shirt worth $68 is thematerial the material is so lightweightand breathable and it's just it has kindof like the cooling factor that someshirts have so I just I really reallylove that and that's what makes it worththe price for me and then I love them toknow so much that I have the same thingbut in tank top form and this is whatthey look like they're just Razorbacksand they're called the run swiftlyracerback and I got this in a size fouras well and this was $48 and I have itin pink and in gray as well the onething that I would have to say aboutLululemon tops are that I don't thinkthey're all that impressivethe only shirts that I would recommendfrom Lululemon are the ones that are inthe run swiftly collection becausethey're all made out of this materialthe other shirts from Lululemon'sI found where you're just there's justnot that impressive and the materialisn't that comfortable so for me I wouldjust save your money and pass on thatand then invest it in either theleggings that are really great or therun swiftly shirts which I really reallylove so that concludes my Lululemonelection I hope this video was helpfulfor those of you who are interested inbuying some new clothes from Lululemonand I hope that you just enjoyedwatching this in general so thank youfor those of you who have subscribedrecently I have a lot of videos plannedso hopefully you'll

hi everyone abby here today i'm going tobe reviewingthe lululemon double strap face maskbut before i get started make sure tohit that subscribe button so you canstay tuned to all my new videos droppingweeklyand so you can help the channel grow andmake sure to stay tuned to the end ofthe video where i'm talking about mygiveawayso this is the lululemon double strapface mask i'm going to post the color onscreen for you guysand it does have two straps on the backthat are adjustableto go over your head this is what itlooks like on the insidethere is really nice stitching going allthe way around it there's no kind ofloose threadsor anything like that which is good i dowant to say that it does not have likeany adjustable kind of wiring at thefront for the bridge of your noseand it doesn't really have anyadjustable you know spots on the maskother than the strapso how this face mask works is basicallyyou put it on over your head the bottomstrap goes on firstand that's kind of at your lower neckarea and the top strap goes around yourheadafter using this for about two months ido want to say that it is very durablei have washed it so far about four timesand it looks just askind of good as new quality wise i domake sure to you know washmy lululemon stuff in cold wateron low spin and hang it to dry i reallydo like the color of this and i think itlooks nice onand if you're just looking for like aregular mask to wear around every day ithink this is a great option for youbecause it is a single layer face maskis non-medical gradeum just so you guys do know that onething i have to say that is amazingabout this face maskis that because it goes around your headthere's no pressure on your ears at allso this is great for people who havelike ear piercings or people who do havesensitive ears because i know whenyou're wearing the traditional masksif you're wearing them for an extendedperiod of time it really does get taxingon your ears and it starts to hurtso that is one amazing feature aboutthis mask i also do think that it'spretty stylish onand it's comfortable to wear like i saidfor a long period of timei want to let you guys know this is madeof lululemon's ultra lou fabricit's sweat wicking quick drying it hasfour way stretchand these straps are very adjustable soyou can like really adjust them a lothereso i think this fits basically everysize head i mean you can adjust it allthe way down hereand you can adjust it all the way upthat is fantastic about this mask i willsayit does take a couple minutes to adjustit just to get it for the right fit foryour headso to get it uncomfortably so it doesn'tmove around but when it is on your facei will say that it doesfit um very like flushed against yourfacethere's not really any like gapping oranything which is nice i'm happy that itdoes fit well because like i saidthere's like kind of no adjustabilityaround therei'm just talking about kind of puttingthis face mask on i do want to say it'sa littlebit awkward because you do have to kindof pull the two straps over your headbut once you get it on it's verycomfortable to weari'm going to go ahead and show you guyswhat it looks like on mei don't like that this happens sometimesit kind of divotsin there all right guys so here's theproduct information and for anybodyinterested about reading thatso one thing i do want to say is i wishthat they would have been in like apocket fora filter um i think that would have kindof elevated this mask to the next leveland hopefully they do that in the futurebut for right now everyone's stillsocially distancing i think that this isa great match just to wear out and aboutand in terms of working out in iti worked out in this mask about twice sofar it is umdefinitely very moisture wicking i don'tfind my face to be like extremely sweatyor anything as i'm wearing itbut i do want to say that if you arelike running or anything i would notrecommend this for that personally wheni did try running in it

from your home tothe gym or studio wherever you might goI'm going to feature eight items todaynow I either bought them myself or Iasked my family members to get them forme for Christmasmeaning I would have bought them myselfand I'm just gonna feature two itemsthat were sent to me by a company andbecause I really like them all of theseare amazing they're super fun and cuteflattering and functional let's get toitfirst item I'm gonna feature are theadidas Giulia boots you guys know that Iworked with Adidas this past year but Iasked my mom to get these for me forChristmas this was my Christmas presentfrom my mom she got these through theAthleta website they're the adidasTrulia boot now they look like a sneakerbut they're actually a winter boot andthey keep your foot warm and dry butthey look like their sneaker but Iwouldn't recommend working out in themthese are a great alternative to us alot of people have a love/haterelationship with uggs I really likeuggs but I don't want 10 pairs so I gotthese to wear to the gym when I work andwhen I work out and I just bring myregular sneakers in my bags I don't wantthem getting wet in the snow so theseare a really great transitional pieceand an alternative for your winter bootsagain I got these from the Athletawebsite you can look down below they arethe choli a boot by adidasso I announced on my blog and Instagramthat I'm training for the BostonMarathon now one of the reasons why Ihave been so reluctant around the BostonMarathon is because training in the deadof winter in New England sucks it isreally cold and on some weekends it's inthe 20s or the teens and you have to runsixteen milesit sounds miserable so but I signed upfor it so I've got to do it so I wentinvested in this Aries jacket it's byAthletaand it has some nice down on the frontand the back and inside the sleeves itis this super warm almost velvet likematerial now I bought I got a small andit fits really well if it's tight so youdon't needto wear a lot of layers underneath theone word of caution is if you have alittle bit bigger arms when you'rerunning sometimes my elbows get reallyhot in it they kind of sweat but it hasoptional thumb holes that you can use ithas pockets that have zippers so you canput your phone in there or if you'rerunning training for a marathon you canput some energy gels but this jacket issuper cute it's bright so people can seeyou if it's dark out and mostimportantly it's warm and it has a nicehood to even keep your head warm if it'ssnowing or raining out and I just lovethis again this is called the Ariesjacket it's one forty eight which iskind of a lot if you are a fitnessinstructor I know a lot of you guyswatching my videos you guys are youactually get a discount at athletic somake sure you ask about that you getabout 20% if it's not on sale if it's onsale you've got whatever spray derp butI bought this it ended up being about ahundred dollars or a little bit morethan $100 with my discount so I highlyrecommend if you're a fitness instructorcheck out Athleta for a fabulousdiscount and also this jacket if you'relooking for a piece to keep you warmwhile you run this wintersticking with the running during thewinter I wanted to feature some glovesso I lost my running gloves from lastyear and so I needed a new pair and Ithought that Santa might be bringing mea pair so I went to Old Navy and I gotthese really cute fleece white glovesthey have the special fabric on thethumb and the pointer finger so that youcan use your smartphone with them andthese are about five dollars they'regreat to wear while you're running againthey're probably not gonna last me pasta season but if you are on a budget thiswinter and just want a nice small simplepair of gloves to go running I reallylike these Old Navy performance fleeceones this is one of the items that I wasgiven to try out by Asics these are somegloves and these have a differentthey're made of a different material sothat they absorb the sweat from yourhands so they don't get clammy in theseones your hands kind of get like almostlook like you've you've gone swimmingwhen you take them off sometimes butthese have a fun little pouch right herethat you can open and close with velcroso you could put keys or if it'sreally cold out you could even put oneof those skiing hand warmers in and Ididn't realize it but most gloves dohave sizes these are a little too bigfor me I didn't check the size so makesure you check the size when you buyyour gloves I know maybe that's it's meI just don't buy a lot of hand things torealize that they have sizes too andthen also rounding out the how to bewarm this is an ear warmer that my boogot me for Christmasgoes on nicely keeps you nice and warm Igot this from Lululemon I think it wasabout thirty dollars but it's super cutesuper warm I was sweaty and honestly Iread where this for 14 miles and I can'teven tell that I did it doesn't spell Iguess that means that I just sweatperfume it's really warm and it's fuzzyand comfortable and I love it and itlooks good even when you're not runningmy favorite running shoe is the adidasboost for sure I featured it in manyvideos but this is kind of similar toadidas so if you prefer Asics on theyjust fit your shoot foot better I reallylike these these are the the gel trainerthe gel OS trainer and I just they'rereally lightweight and they'recomfortable and the colors are supercute I love teal and pink the last twoitems I'm gonna feature are two that Ibought at Lululemon this weekend I havesome sheets coming up and I want to lookcute so you guys can you'll be able tosee these in a video real soonthis is the exquisite bra it is meant towear alone it's kind of like a crossbetween a sports bra and a crop top oneof the girls that Lululemon told me thatshe actually wears this has a crop topwith a skirtwell Lululemon is coming out withlifestyle clothes so I'm not surprisedit has some cute cutouts here on theside a little bit of see-through fabricand modest coverage for a sports bra notmodest coverage for a tank top but Ijust love the strappy backsit's light support so I wouldn't wearthis for like a hit workout but for hotyoga yeah or for a workout video forsure so you guys can expect to see thison me in a video very soon this here isthe wild tank now this just a superflattering on my body type it has abeautiful cross back that is a differentcolor this has a moreis a more supportive Sports Bra it islight luan fabric is sweat wicking it'sslim fit it hits at your hips so it'snot one of those super long ones andbest of all I love this drapey back Ilove one tank tops are made to show offyour sports bra because sometimesthey're just as cute as a shirt youdon't want to hide them and this one'skind of a nice like almost like blackand grey blue army army type color soyou're gonna be able to see this in aworkout video very soon if you haven'talready so those are my favorite winterfitness items oh and I almost forgotthis top that I'm wearing my roommate asyou guys know who's my boyfriend he gotthis for me for Christmas knowing thatI'm running the Boston Marathon and howmuch I'm dreading running in the coldthis is a super warm top that was Ithink about $100 Lululemon's expensivewe all know that but they have a nicelittle pocket right here where you canput your phone or your keys or creditcard some gels if you're doing a longrun they have vents in the armpits so noI'm not sweating they're just ventsthumb holes and also you can also storesome keys or credit card under here andit also says underneath right here readyor snot so I think that means thatLululemon is anticipating me using thislike a tissue while I'm running and Iprobably will kind of gross but I'mgonna wash it every time anyway so thisreally is the last item that I'm goingto feature it's flattering it looks cuteyou can wear it during errands orwhatever so hopefully you guys enjoyedthis favourites video don't forget

hello everyone today I'm going to do adifferent kind of video I'm going totalk to you about my gym attire and I'malso going to go over a couple exercisesthat I have been loving and the onesthat I find really effective at themoment so I'll do that at the very endof the video but first I wanted to talkto you about this brand new tank top nowI have fallen absolutely in love with Igot it from this website called P V bodyand for those of you who don't know Imostly weight lift and do a lot ofcardio but I'm going to integrate yogainto my routine and I'm going to startnext weekI'll be doing hot yoga so I'm reallyexcited and I was looking for some brandnew yoga clothes that I could wearLululemon which is my favorite fitnessclothing brand does make clothes thatare great for hot yoga but even when Iwear them to the gym sometimes I justget just way too sweaty and then mightbe TMI for some of you but I did want tomention it because in hot yogayou essentially drip with sweat becauseyou're in a room that's about a hundredand five degrees so I was looking for amore lighter weight tank top and I foundthis chemical style tank on Peavy bodyand you can go ahead and check out thelink down below in the description boxif you're interested but they're one ofthose websites that give you a completewardrobe every month and it is asubscription-based site but you takethis one easy quiz to determine yourfitness needs and what your fashionsense is like and they'll put together aWardrobe full of clothing for you thatyou can wear to the gym or for whateveractivities that you tell them you'reparticipating in so this is actually ayoga brand and I had never heard of itbefore trying itit's called electric yoga by Michelleand I have this tank and extra small iteven has that cool barcode scan and it'san extra small in this bright blueturquoise color and what I love about itis not just the fact that it'slightweight but I really like thepattern and the dual texture of thefabric so as you can see it has thislightning-bolt style and it has reallythin straps that don't dig into the skinI'm a really big fan of that soapparently it's meant to wash well Ihaven't watched it yet but it doesabsorb sweat really well and it's madeout of this fabric called Eloy which issupposed to be moisture wicking fabricand I really do love this so I thinkthey will go out of my way to find moreof these in different colors becausethis pattern is really slimming and I'llshow a I'll go ahead and show you apicture of what this tank top looks likeon meand now that you've seen the tank top onmy body I know people are going to askwhat bottoms are you wearing I amactually wearing these gray performancesports wear leggings by American Appareland I also got these from PE Biba andwhen I first pulled them out I thoughtwell these look really short and I mighthave to crop them into capris but infact they fit perfectly down to theankle and I'm definitely going to bewearing these to my first yoga sessionI'm really excited because they fit alot like higher quality Victoria Secretpink pants but Victoria Secret pink Icannot wear their yoga bottoms becauseeven though they fit in the thighsthey're extra small has a waistbandthat's about I don't know three or fourinches much too large so I can literallypull it forward and that's why I can'twear them but if you have that problemas well then definitely wear the extrasmall in the American Apparel leggingsso here you go extra small and Iactually might buy these in black if Ican find them so I really do like theseleggings the waistband is nice and thickvery fitting around the waist Icurrently have a 23 22 and a half inchwaist depending on what time of the dayI measure so it is a little difficultfor me to find pants that fit wellbecause I still have muscular thighs butmy waist is shrinking so these clothesI've definitely made it easier on me andnow I know what to look for just checkout that link down below in thedescription box you will also run intosome cool new brands that you haven'ttried I mean I thought Lululemon was itfor me but now that I keep shrinking Iwant to try different brands and seewhat fits my body best so definitelytake that quick and easy quiz in thebeginning and see what they pull up foryou also one thing to note a lot ofpeople ask me well can you get Lululemonon sale TV body sight does haveLululemon andon sale for 60% off retail prices andevery month you'll get $150 worth ofclothing for 50 bucks so $49.99 and it'sfree shipping just like the Lululemonsite so if you couldn't find Lulu on TVbody then I highly recommend you pick itup there because as you guys know I loveLulu by loving these two new pieces thatI got so definitely check them out sonow for some Lulu I know that I have alot of Lulu addicts that are currentlywatching and waiting for this kind ofreview but I am loving the new powerwide tanks and I know some people havebeen having issues with the power whythey feel like the new Lu on lightfabric is cheaper lesser in quality andI have to admit even though I do haveone of the older power wise I actuallyliked the Lu on light better and I feelthat it worksI mean maybe for hot yoga it's differentbecause I haven't started but in termsof weightlifting or doing a lot ofcardio I feel like the Lu on light eventhough it doesn't absorb sweat as wellit dries faster and it clings to my bodyproperly without being too compressive Istill wear a size two I'll stand up soyou can see this is a size two and I hadit come short it was about four inchesmuch too long but as you guys know bynow I'm only 5 feet so most tank topsand shirts are a lot too long for menonetheless I really love the luan lightpower Y and sometimes the straps kind offlip over and dig into my back so Idon't like to wear these when I'msquatting but they do work for one nightfor days when I'm dead lifting orpowered cleaning so it's all up to you Ican see why some people don't like theluan light but I really like it and Ibought this in the love red which is nolonger available but they just broughtout some new pinks and as well as a newblue so check them out now for thisfirst base tank this is a running tankand let me just say now that even thoughI wear a two and everything Lulu a lotof times they don't make a size two incertain tank tops so I have to go withthis ice floor and what I like to do isshrink it in the dryer it does stretchout when I'm working once the sweat sitsinto the fabric it starts to stretch andpull but when I put it backdryer it fits pretty well I like to wearthis one loose though because it has anice long tail in the back and somepeople don't like that but again youknow I like to cover my bum so this tanktop is perfect for me plus I like theraspberry glow light color with the navyblue which apparently is pretty similarto indigo which was released a long timeago so if you're a longtime loulou fan Ididn't have anything in the indigo colorpreviously so the Black Swan color hereis perfect for me it's a really reallydark navy so again this is the firstbase tank and I really like it it'sgreat for those of us with smaller bustsI heard that it does not work well forthose with larger busts so just keepthat in mindand definitely try this one on it alsocomes in the love red color and it'sstill available online now for crops Ibought a bunch of crops planning to do aLululemon haul a couple months ago orlast month but in the past three weeksthey've discontinued all of them sounfortunately I talked about one pair inmy last favorites video and then theyput them on sale so they're all gone nowbut I still have this one pair that Ican talk to you about that's stillonline and it is the run for your lifecrop and I have them in a discontinuedcolor this is the Alberta Lake but Ireally really love these crops generallyI wear a four in the crops even like infitted two just because I like to put myLululemon in the dryer technicallyyou're supposed to hang dry them but Ilike to put them in in the dryer butgoing back to these crops they haven'tbeen a bunch of new colors now there's abright blue and there's black but if Iwere you if you're like me or on thesimilar size I would size down just oneit might be a little tight and you mighthave to air dry them and not put them inthe dryer like I do but I wish I hadsigns down to a two in these becausethey can get a little loose there theyfit a little larger than my favoritecrops that are no longer available soI'm notgonna name them but I did mention that Ididn't like the ruching around the kneewith the run with my homies crop andthis run for your life crop has similarruching at the knee but it starts higherup and this crop on the model on theLululemon website it stops right underthe knee but for me because I'm so shortat 5 feet it stopsunderneath my calf so for me the ruchinglooks fine I didn't love it at first Ijust bought it because I really wantedthis Alberto Lake color and it was alimited edition it's really hard to findnow but again the reason why I wanted totalk about this crop is number onebecause it's available in many colorsand sizes and I wanted to let you knowif you wanted it to size down and airdry and so now that we have the clothingtalked all out of the way I wanted tomention a couple things that I'm doingso a lot of you keep asking me for myworkout split but I've only been usingthe split for about two and a half threeweeks I really didn't have a dedicatedworkout planmostly I squat deadlift and clean andeven then I don't clean that much Imostly squat deadlift and hit theStairmasterand the treadmill so if you want to loseweight if you are planning to lose alarge amount of weight the first thingyou going to do is stop eating jugs stopdrinking soda stop eating out and hitthe treadmill so the best thing for youto do is low-impact I don't recommendyou start running right away becauseit's you know tough on the kneesespecially if you're carrying a lot ofextra weight so get on the Stairmasterput the treadmill on incline and walk ashigh as you can as long as you can makesure you're dripping in sweat if you'renot dripping in sweat you're not workinghard enough make sure you sweat it outbut for me my goals are right now tobuild shoulders and upper body strengthand abs currently my abs are reallycoming along well especially with mydiet I'm whittling down my frame my absare really starting to show through andI'm loving it right now for my abs I'mfocusing mostly on building the obliquesso that v-shape will but my favorite abexercisesactually the roaming twists withmedicine ball so you just move the ballside to side use the Mac get down on thefloor and I actually like hanging leglifts and Roman chair lifts I reallydread assisted pull-ups you can use themachine I can't do a pull-up on my ownbut it's been really great for my backmy shoulders and it helps your absespecially if your body is perfectlystraight when you're doing them so thoseare just a couple tips I will go aheadand post my workout split once I reallydecide what I like currently it's stillchanging so it's a work in progress andonce I have something really substantialto share

"[Music]okay hello everybody and welcome toinvesting with IBD for August 28 2019I'm your host Arusha Pierce and with metoday is Howard linson he's a serialentrepreneur and the co-founder of stocktwitsthanks for being here Howard cereal Andylikes cereal on today's podcast we aregoing to talk about the current marketsthe importance of managing yourweaknesses and current stocks but beforewe get into that Howard let's go over alittle bit of your background now weknow you already like cereal but how didhe get into investing I was born andraised in Toronto I think I think myparents gave me a little money because Iremember losing it on a stock calledclearly Canadian ok2say which was theLacroix of like the 80s in a lot Wow soit was I wasn't a millennial but I lostmy ass in Lacroix it was called clearlyCanadian was a hot stock I think on theVancouver Stock Exchange I don't evenknow if there was a Nasdaq back thenbecause I was living in Toronto and Ithink I lost about 6,000 dollars ofabout a $6,500 account okay not thatthat's not goodand it just infuriated me to the pointthat I probably stopped investing forten years and finish school and thenended up back in the market ten yearslater okay and what inspired you getback in after that time I needed a joband we see the 987 so it was funnystories in graduated from college and 80you know 87 and went to work in Torontobecause I didn't want to be in the stockmarket but I needed a job from myundergraduate degree yeah and I went towork in Toronto for a company calledDavidson partnerin the wire room and back in the wireroom in those days you know orders camein and only in a little bubble tube andabout one month into my job the stockmarket crashed oh wow that's perfecttiming and I remember all the tubesbacking up I didn't know what the hellwas going on usually would be like acouple orders an hour and then I wasjust mass confusion in the office andpeople trying to clamor to get into themailroom Wow and and none of them ladiesobviously and I I was let go you knowlastin first-outembroidery of human meat I was let go acouple weeks later and the firm was shutdown and I should have bought that dip Iguess but I know what I didn't know whatbuying the dip meant right so I wentback to school okay yeah and and so nowyou've been you've been investing in thein the markets for it for 35 years nowand and you ran a hedge fund for 20years yeah I graduate with an MBA fromASU I I moved out to the Stateswant you know chasing the Sun and thegood weather we had grown up with a homein Arizona and I love the desert lovedjust the whole vibe of living in thedesert and went to Arizona State I wasCanadian so I wasn't a legal pre Trumpso there was a chance if I could stay inthe country and am I allowed to sayanti-trump on this network so I it wasfree I didn't have a green card oranything and so I applied for a job I itwas a stockbroker job and and that wasrated just before the 90 recession yeahand that's an out crisis at the centerthat was like my hometown in Phoenix soI was like over nine it will arc it bythis time Wow yeah but I was just sofascinated by how things worked in likepanics and recessions and everything myevery experience I have with the marketwas going 2-0 but I had a great mentorin the brokerage business and he taughtme how to sell and I just was fascinatedby picking stocks and I think Starbuckswas going public at the time andBlockbuster Video like 1991 yeah and youknow those were the internet kind ofstocks of the day yeah and I just gothooked and technology was just startinguntil the 386 processor probably and Ijust got in at the right time and fellin love with the stock market and so howdid your investing strategy evolveduring those times where maybe in thebeginning you were you're buying morejust on on companies but eventuallyevolved into relative strength it tocharts how did that process happen yesthe big issue was there was no meant forsliding that money so my job is to sellyeah there's good sales and back thingyou had a call you didn't you couldn'tgo to LinkedIn or use social web andbuild your brand you were just smilingand dialing and so that was a game in away right and you know you had to buildyour clientele so it was not about mebuying stocks is about me figure out howto sell stocks yeah and you know I lovedit and but it also war the war me thehell out yeah just a few friends and anddecided to switch sides and get on thethe buy side and I was an entrepreneurand if you're gonna be an entrepreneurand love stocks there was such you knowit could start a hedge fund and at thetime everybody would start it seemedlike a bubble no different thaneverybody's starting a venture capitalfund today in 2019 in 86 87 it was likethat's what you did started a hedge fundso every but it's a bubble of Howard'sstarting a hedge fund it's a bubble youscratch no real experienceyeah but I had a lot of wealthy friendsI trusted me over the years of sellingand they said go at it and it led me ona 20-year miserable path of trying tobeat the markets and you know with noreal experience just to trust of yourfriends right and no money for Bloombergandyou know I wasn't a news guy I was justout in the dark trying to you knowfigure out how to be he has to pee andbeating the S&P back then wasn't like itis now like it wasn't about beating theS&P it was just about making yourtwo-and-twenty and making trying to dowell yeah but I discovered investor'sbusiness daily it became kind of myBible and it just resonated with me thatyou know good companies would show upwith high relative strength and you juststarted to recognize that like momentumyou know good momentum begets moremomentum and it just became the strategythat always made sense to me so I'vebeen a relative strength IBD 50 marketSmith fan Friday now from the day onethat I had discovered a perfect perfectnow and then you eventually started acompany wall strip right and and and howlong do you that that was wrong with2006 2005 let me just have a drink yeahthis is when they start drinking when Igot on the internet show shows mm soimagine me like you hardly know me butimagine me in you know I I didn't haveit didn't have a big hedge funds underunder 100 million I believe I gotta behonest I was more about preservingcapital Mike no one was really watchingme I was more about preserving capitaland taking risk and learning so so my LPis a basically paid for my education andthey were paying and I just hate youknow I didn't I hated what I was doing Ihated the stress of like trying to beatthe marketyou know we'd gone through now theJapanese the long-term capitalmanagement lady a and me gone throughAsian contagion and you've gone throughthe bubble of the Internet right and itmade so many just surviving in 2000 by2005 I'm like I can't even believe I'mdoing thisyeah it's the warnout I did point I wasa terrible person you know you're alwaystrying to beat the market/ what like helping people you know beatthe indexes and and I hated CNBC justjust hated it just and that's whatresonated with me I just hate yeah theonly thing I needed was my IBD and youknow a couple smart friends and that wasmy world and so so the internet comesalong and and YouTube comes along in2005 and I'm like it was all cat videosand and I don't even like cats but I wasYouTube I'm a dog guy and the I'm likeI'm gonna create CNBC on YouTube thatwas the brainstorm that I have I spend alot of time by myself and I called someventure capitals cool called someventure capitalist raise $600,000 andstarting a show called wall strip it wasa three minute was the firstprofessionally produced non cat videoshow on YouTube and it was about onestalk a day and an all-time high calledwall strip and it's kind of based on andI've you know stocks at all-time highstend to keep stay at all-time highs inthe first show was Apple it became likeI smashed it from day one and CBS ikwe're the first show ever acquired so Iwent from a tiny room by myself and itwas the first show ever acquired by amajor network off the internet so that'smy claim to fameyeah Wow and then so then after thatafter CBS acquired wall strip a fewyears later I was working here becausethey realize what the hell they had doneand they wanted to fire me after abouttwo days I was like Clarence Beeks ofCBS Wow and but I lasted 18 months andduring that time Twitter had become a Irecognized Twitter becoming a phenomenonthe first time I saw Twitter I go thisis dumb the tenth time I saw Twitter Igo this is dumb but the hundredth timewhen I set it up I go this is gonnadisrupt bloomberg wrote a blog postabout how Twitter is the next Bloombergand started stock twist I negotiate outof my non-compete with CBS and startedstock to it which wasbasically the idea of Twitter for stocksand we invented the dollar sign which isnow the cash tag as a way to search onTwitter to find people talking aboutstocks and 12 years later stock - it'sprobably the largest social network forstocks ya know and I'm perfect in somany people look obviously Twitter'sbigger but it's not a stock focus thatright and and so many people havelearned through stock twits and reallygone through that learning curve a lotquicker then then I was able to 20 yearsago so IBD was my pellet called apeloton right perfect charts from eletown that's what I call it the you knowif you just to get this point across youwatch the Tour de France I'm a cyclistyou watch the Tour de France and I'mfascinated by like how that pelotonworks like how do they do that race youknow 21 days in the mountains blah blahblah but really you know 70% of itthey're in a peloton and they're going40% faster than they could by themselvesand that really applies to everyindustry whether it's birds or whetherit's people following each otherobviously in the stock market with somany people you got to be careful whoyou're following but once you build astrong peloton whether it's data orwhether it's people you can block therest of the noise out and and so sothat's what Twitter was to me beyond andthat's what stocks what's became evenmore fine-tuned and that's what we'respeeding people's education up you knowyou can give people a couple website youknow IBD and stock twits and they gogreat togetheryeah perfect and so so so after thatwith stock twits so that I think this isa perfect way to kind of segue into thenext segment where we're gonna talkabout you know you continuing to becomebe an entrepreneur and learning fromthose trends so when we come back wewill we will learn more from Howard andhow he's using his entrepreneurexperience to pick up on latest trendsand also we will go into the currentmarket so stay tuned hey guysArusha from investing with IBD here makesure to subscribe rate and review if youhaven't already we'd really appreciateit you can also send us yourquestions and comments to investingpodcast at investors dot-com we wouldlove to hear from you and may use yourcomments on an upcoming episodeHoward lenses are guests on investingwith IBD okay Howard so let's get intothe current market and then we're gonnaget back more into your experience hereso now the current market it's beenvolatile the IBD has it under pressurefor distribution days on the Nasdaqthree on the S&P 500 what are you seeingin this environment I'm seeing what yousee I read what you read yeah yeah youknow it's just a lot of people yellingincluding myself we're all yellingeither at Trump or with him you knowwhat I see is a very strong US economymm-hmno interest rates but like you said thedata is is tippy like there's a lot ofstuff going on under the surface and Iwouldn't be shocked if we dip down butI'm not gonna I don't short stocksanymore I'm just too lazy and don'tmanage other people's money so cash ismy hedge and I got a pretty high cashposition I'm 53 I might have a very highamount of money in startups from my realjob yeah and my passion is stocks andI'm super bullish but I'm really on theverge of like flipping the other way andjust leaning even more into cash so Ifeel like the are leaders are temptingthe gods with the rhetoric yeah and youknow the market could get the marketcould get saucy yeah we're gonnaprobably have a strong resolution oneway or the other with with thisindecisive environment we're here nowyou've got a lot of overhead yes yesyeah you know like you break lower andyou know the restaurants are strong andsoftware is strong and some biotechleadership but so there's speculationgoing on as there should be we've got 2%of 0% interest rates but you can onlyyou know huff and puff on this stuff forso long right right ok so let's get intobecause it's a good segue on managingyour weakness because one of thethings especially when you're newer thetraders you you feel like you have totrade every day and that is a hugeweakness that yeah I think we all learneventually hey you don't have to do thatso so let's go into that and and howthat's a pretty big weakness for tradersthat they need to overcome yeah I meanmy son vapes you know we sent himarticles every day about how it's gonnakill him right like yeah I thought itwas cute that he babe no I'm like killmy son so I mean like it's over youwe've got these drugs all around us nowwe have Robin Hood and Stockton saysabout to have a trade app and you knowwe we've taken the Commission down to aphone and a click and free I mean areyou talking I mean we're gonna have anepidemic of trading we so those thathave learned to master it already aregonna have a great next 10 or 20 yearsbecause you know the Bears bearish orbullish there's millions of people inthe next that have been on board 30 40million Millennials have been tradingcrypto in stocks for the last threeyears on Robin Hood and coinbase so I'msuper bullish but at the same time kidsare gonna have to learn just like theyhad to do with their phone and tinderand snapchat to put that down and toenjoy these things for what they arethey're magnificent and the markets aremagnificent one of the greatestachievements of aggregating people'sopinions and money it's one of thegreatest things that capitalism isproduced and under appreciated and sopeople need to respect it and to respectit you need to be able to enjoy itwithout doing it every minute and whenyou say super bullish you're superbullish just done the future of thestock market right the new participantsthe alternative is is to turn on the TVand give up on life right so I'm justsuper bullish on if you don't have theTV on how can you not be bullish it'strue it's obviously I'm not talkingScioscia nom when people have you knowthere's problems in the world I get itbut I'm luckily you know never had thoseproblems so I'm not gonna I can't forcemyself to have problems I mean I look atthe worldas a glass apple Oh glass half-full isthe secret word of the day the the so Ilook at the you know for every buyerthere's a seller and stocks go throughovervalued undervalued periods but in ain a world that we are in the no wayknows what's going on with all thisinformation out there nobody knowsanything it's fantastic from that we'regonna have the next Warren Buffett andhe's right now he's eighteen years oldand has a lot of tattoos and is probablydrinking white cloth the the next thenext billionaires and you know everybodythinks the the markets will die withWarren Buffett I think Warren Buffettsucks and I don't mean sucks I mean likeand the next the next Warren Buffett'sgonna be completely different rightright and so I'm super sad they may bethey may make their fortunes tradingsneakers and cars and rare collectiblesyou know because so I tried to keep anopen mind all this and so now with partthat being super bullish is you being anentrepreneur you're in involved ininvesting in companies at early stagesand you're seeing these great trends andalready these huge huge trends that arehappening really on the ground level andso how's that helped you in the stockmarket and first let's probably just outof what are you seeing I'm seeing somepep listen I'm not a geek as I laughedabout how bad I am at technology andthat's the beautiful thing of this worldtechnology out of code ness and I thinkyou have an edge if you can codeobviously and if you went to MIT youhave an edge that's just life so kidsyou know go to school and go to theright schools and learn to code but Idon't and but I technology is nowimmersed like it's hard not to be ableto use this right right and and do youreally need a printer in this game youcan get by with your camera and your andyour smartphone so you are astechnologically savvy as you need to bebut you know in the days when you and Iwere doing thisyeah Doss and you like I mean oh my godI don't knowyeah so so in the world where everybodyin the world is connected and we live ina world for now that's still very mobileright like I don't like some of thepolicies of this is where I hate D youknow taking away globalization I wantI've earned my freedom or I'm lucky tohave my freedom and I cherish thatfreedom getting on a plane and gettingout of town and Millennials do too andgenerations he expect that so those arethey those are the black swans that wewhen talks about those are the blackswans right the freedom to cheat bemobile right once you've given peoplemobile and you take that away that's thewar that's the nightmarebut barring that it's not about therecession and it's not about Trump andit's not about a one wall it is aboutthe wall it's not about just one wall soin this world of technology it's justhard not to see how this doesn't keepbuilding on itself and the world that'sconnected things are gonna speed uptrends are gonna happen faster and andmarkets are connected and we're seeingshooting start the chart patterns lookedthe same they're just compressed rightbecause technology is shrinking time soit's the same same patterns over andover again and they're just they're justa little bit different with respect totime and they're a little bit differentnow because people there's less analystsin the world and they're a little bitdifferent because they've been fired orthe banks have been shrinking andthey're a little bit different becauseof the speed of which are happening onthe speed at which they can be disruptedthemselves yep so these are all justdifferent things happening and so someof the industries where you seeing someof this disruption happen whichindustries are you seeing like biotechor aerospace just option it's you knowMarc Andreessen said oh and you said itwell and software is eating the worldyeah but it's not the only trainersoftware eats the world you know realestate prices will continue to go up andbeen good assets so and its softwareeats the worldit helps biotech companies growAsaf reads the world it helps fashioncompanies do more things so so theunderlying factor is software right wehave this what totally connected and youhave analysts well first of all you havethe shrinking chip of analyst and thensecond of all you have new rules beingdeveloped meaning we have not seencompanies that this size because they'vebeen able to scale so quickly so yeah ina world with less analyst and in a worldwith less models because we've neverseen these models before yeah I meaneverything's thrown out the windows so Imean that's what makes me bullish allthis stuff's gonna have to be rethoughtand reimagined and who's to say WarrenBuffett understands this market sure ina world without Tecna without softwareand without network effects value meantsomething and financial metrics metsomething but in a world whereeverybody's connectedgood luck measuring what the value ofsomething is yeah and you're seeing thissoftware although example that isBitcoin sorry the perfect example ofthat a fake one right the volatility andthe polarization that that's caused isunbelievable because both sides areright nobody has the right answer but itis an incredible piece of software withno employees right completely opensourceno overhead yeah no health cost nocarpal tunnel employee complaintsbecause they've been coding is and andit's like Facebook without employees andit's being built on servers that theydon't have to pay for right distributeit so in crazy it's a great argument Ihave no idea but directionally I'mbullish on a piece of software that hasbrand recognition at every corner of theworld and may not be fast enough totransfer money for everybody yet yeahcould be one of the greatest pieces ofsoftware of all time so so the softwareexists Bitcoin and also blockchain ingeneral as a technology coin is ablockchain right open-source softwareyou know elastic you know whoknows how big these companies can getAmazon in many ways open sourcingfascinating fascinating so the key issoftware eating the world and and thinkabout that as it applies to manyindustries like aerospace genetics oreven real estate so coming up next whatwe're gonna do is we are going todiscuss three companies that are alittle bit older companies but they arecontinuing to innovate it is they'recontinuing to innovate and they alsoinnovate with stylestay tuned want to find stocks like theones on this podcast a lot of the bestnames we talked about come from IB DSexclusive

months for only $20we are back with Howard linson and soHoward let's go to some current stocksand now the first three stocks are we'regoing to talk about they're part of yourFatih ology category so I think thefirst thing is let's define what fashionology is yeah coined at about 10 12years ago with Oh Cleo Cleo to openthese stores and they had had BluetoothMotorola headphone built into the Oakleyphone and I was like that I coined theterm pathology saying fashion meetstechnology meaning you're never gonnabuy Motorola sunglasses but you will buyApple sunglasses with Motorola parts yesand so I was very bullish on Oakley butthey sold to luxottica I thought thatwas a terrible thing but it was a gooddeal but like that was that killed agreat brand that was at the edge ofpathology right yep and they inventedthis idea they were the air pods beforethe air pops I mean that company waslike onto something and so it was reallydisturbing to me because I was sobullish on Oakley and then along comesApple and that has become the largestfashion ology company in the worldmeaning they combined fashion which wasdesigned yeah and people want to have itand with technology so they're theleading fashion ology company I'mimmensely bullish on the companyobviously China has a major it's a majorfactor for Apple they've got consideringhow crazy the markets are with respectto tariffs and how serious the issuereally is Apple's held them theremagnificentlyI think it's massively undervaluedbecause of law of large numbers andpeople can't get their heads around thefact that women and kids are going to begoing to the Genius Bar for the next 60years right they figured out retail andBashaw they figured it all that and soit's my biggest position I it when it'srunning it's not it's because of largelaw of large numbers it's my biggestposition but I also you know trimming onruns and added on 20% depth so so Appleright now they're forming a really bigcup with handle they broke out came backin with the market obviously but it'sbeen hanging and withoutyeah it's not gonna get without anyresolution to China meaning I've beentrimming in and adding other stocks overthe last six months it's just as it runsI trim and you know if it hits all-timehighs well you know that's a good signif I'd probably pile back into it andsome of the some of the new productsthat they have now that though thewatches is really starting to take offjin horse yep sick rod my 21 year olddaughter lived in new york this year shecouldn't wait one of the first purchaseshe did with her own you know that hernew job money was an Apple watch I waslike really and it's women loved thisproduct they use it for differentreasons it's not to check tinder to usethe phone it's to compete around Fitnessyeah and little little you know littlecute things that they do that the phonedoes and step stuff that I don't careabout but and the air pods the air podsare a magnificent piece of flesh ologyyep and now the credit card to writethey just released the credit card whichis a stylish yeah they just have a lockin that people don't know so it's fun tohate Apple because they're so big I getit but you know the fact that that SteveJobs past and it's been down or 810years and they can still execute at thislevel it's it's an amazing company whateverybody's copying Italy everybodywould like to be out that's true I meanthat's true it's yeah let's go to thesecond stock and this is Nike right andand another company that's been aroundthey has such a strong brand name andand it's not just us half their sales orinternational these days and they'repart of this whole its fashionableathletic at you know the other categorythat people always coin is that leisurecategory which you know the same wewon't say that well say fashion ology solet them call it athleisure that it's Idon't follow people that call itathletes terrible that's like people inlike in like terry cloth robes LeisureSuit Larry when I was a kid so this isabout fashion and technology and and andNike does a fantastic job they're afashion company but they're on the edgealways of Technology made a few mistakesaredigital they're just not a great digitalcompany other than e-commerce orincredible ecommerce company and they'reincredibly good at understanding culturein terms of you know the secondarymarkets for their shoes and the way theycreate pop-up stores but I'm superbullish on Nike China just like Appleit's not gonna get it's not gonna rampif if there wasn't a China sure rightnow stock would be over a hundred noproblem and so you're not gonna you knowagain you got to look elsewhere rightnow because these stocks are gonna marktime with the tariff issues but mark myword if this tear stuff goes on foreverthey're gonna figure this out yeahand they're gonna figure out how tomanufacture stuff elsewhere but whatApple does well is partner with otherbig technology companies because of thesize of their brand and their e-commerceis fantastic and this secondary marketthrough stock ax and goat apples at theforefront a ninety nine it's agenerational brand you hope that stockdrops twenty five percent so you can buyit yeah and right now net Nikes forminga flat base they've been trying to formand they've been for my number of basesduring this volatile market the latestone is a flat base here most importantlyhere you know shoot our best book thatI've read in twenty years about businessit wasn't really a business book as muchit was a Bible Becky went through thisperiod as he got older I think that youknow politically you got factions withinthat companies a huge company everybodythinks they're and he went wrote thatbook which is more like hey don't messwith this company right I'm handing downthis book we're gonna we're talkingabout the early twenty years of thiscompany when it was a ten million dollarbusiness and I was going to Japan andChina and open factories so put yourpolitics aside within the company Ithink was a genius move by Phil Knightas he had elite you know as he got olderand left his company and left a legacyto say don't up the excuse myFrench but like respect the brand likeright we built this company you're herebecause of us you know you know don'tscrew up this company yeah and I thinkthat I think they the stocks done verywell in the last three years since thatbook droppedand for a big company I think that couldbe easily a half a trillion dollarcompany and and everything's aboutculture and brand right and alwaysreminding and having that that's theBible orders right that's right right solet's go to the third stock and this isa younger company but they've beenaround for a little while now Lululemonand and they have carved their own bothand technology but definitely fashionthey've carved their own niche so that'simportant it's riskier as everybodycopies you and your PE goes up or youryour multiples go up there's not it'snot that there's no risk but I've ownedthe stock forever I feel like it's justin a world and let's use the wordleisure but in a work because I don'tthink of them as a fashion as muchfashion as leisure but in a world wherepeople can now wear to work in the in asoftware world where they can weart-shirts and and and kind of Lulu typeABC pants to work they are in a perfectposition the the products are light sothey make them easy to travel with youcan mix and match them like your animalsit's it's been run without a CEO for itthe founder isn't even there anymore andthey manage to continue which is youknow which really was a is really theone big worry that I have is they don'thave that founder involved right but atthe same time he's still a hugeshareholder and I think he still kind ofgot a big pull on that company and it'sjust such a great brand that it seemslike almost anybody can run it right nowand then obviously expansion the companyis tiny so Asia Europe they juststarting opening stores in Amsterdam Imean this company no one no one knowsthe brand yep and and now out of thethree stocks have you spoken so far Luludefinitely has the best relativestrength the most constructive chartpattern here - well if there gets theyit's just a steady uptrend so they'rereally fighting this market yeah you'readding stocks today Nike and Apple I'mnot saying Adam becausethe China situation you know but I'veonly stalked for a while I'm not goingto pay the taxes and sell them and I'mtrading around them but yeah and but Ihave a lot of other ideas but thefashion ology trend is something thateverybody that can understand yep solet's go to one more stock and and thisis McDonald's what why don't you talkabout how technology has has helpedMcDonald's well I think it was writtenup we had this period where Domino's ifyou look at Domino's were like four orfive years it was outperforming everytech stock because Domino's was a techstock Domino's really was an in-appexperience you know my son could be atthe golf course order the pizza on hison his Domino's app and it would beDylan he could triangulate it arrivingat the house at the same time we got atoast because they had their ownbuilt-in delivery service yeah but alarmand so and McDonald's struggled Chipotlestruggled all the fast-food guysstruggled then quietly well nobodyunderstood it along comes post matesubereats lifts door - and they'rethey're subsidizing and and those thethings that were most ordered on thosethings were Big Macs you know and namesthe kids recognized my sons were ingoddamned Big Macs on on ovaries yeah soso what happened is the door - and thosebecame the delivery mechanism and becamecaught if you look at a chart of dominosthe last two years it's gone down that'syour world where the others have gone upbecause they have menu competition so soMcDonald's it makes sense that they arenow benefiting from the VCS pouringhundreds of millions of dollars intodelivery companies which are justjacking McDonald's sales that that'sinteresting and it's been just a steadyuptrend for for McDonald's really lowvolatile because so undervalued in aworld where Domino's had that runbecause McDonald's has way moredistribution a bigger menuit's trusted and they have for deliverycompanies bidding for that business soit's really have been a fascinatingtrend so I think that's it's been youknow I've owned it since about 150 andit's a buy the dip type of stock becauseit's

hey guys this is gonna be my very firstworkout clothing haul I do a lot ofclothing hauls all the time on randomother fashionable things but I've neveractually done a haul video on workoutclothes but the more and more I'm gointo the gymobviously I'm having a lot of funshopping and I find that when I'mwearing stuff that excites meit gets me more motivated and excited toactually go to the gym so not the thingsthat I'm always there matchy-matchy Iwould prefer to match and I have enoughenough stuff that I can but um anywayI've had a lot of stuff kind ofaccumulating a lot of the stuff I've hadfor months I don't even know if youcould still get it but I just kind ofthought I would throw everythingtogether in this hole some of the stuffI got recently I decided to check outthe new Carrie Underwood Kalia line atDick's recently and I ended up pickingup some other stuff there and I havesome stuff from Lululemon and target ofcourse so I just wanted to shareeverything with you let's start let'sstart target target target for the mostpart I tend to stick to basic black andgrey for my workout stuff just like inmy normal wardrobe but when I was inTarget recently they had this beautifulhot coral and like highlighter yellowstuff that came out and it just got mereally excited for spring I'm stillbundling up to go to the gym I'm stillwearing some long sleeve stuff becauseit's still freaking cold here but um Ifigured I would get this stuff to wearwhen it actually decides to be niceoutside so this is just a regular tankand these are from the champion line forTarget it's like a hot coral ombre likepeach colorI got it in that coral color I got it inblack these were $14.99 got them in asmall they have the duo dry which keepsyou dry and not sweaty and it's verystretchy which is really nice they'revery form-fitting they're really great Ialso got this one from the champion lineit's a little bit of a different stylebut it's the same kind of it's adifferent texture I should say but thesame style shirt so love these two justthrow over a sports bra and yourleggings yoga pants whatever this is apulloverlike I said still wearing these becauseit's a I'm cold out these are onlytwenty two ninety-nine which I foundbetween Lululemon even Victoria's Secretthe Carrie Underwood line I think ispriced similar to say gaps workout stufftarget I have found to be the mostreasonably priced most inexpensive andthe quality is not compromised so Ireally am happy about that becauseworkout clothes can be expensive so thisis the highlighter yellow one it's justa zip up and then I got the full trackjacket in the coral they had that onethey have like a zip up in the coralcolor but I went for the actual jacket Ijust love this color I actually think Iput I had this on in a recent video myErin Condren video I just film the introlike right after I had gotten back fromthe gym and I still have this on so ifyou want to see what it looks like it'sjust really a bright really brightpretty color and you stand out like asore thumbbut it's fine I got this sports bratarget has a lot of really nice sportsbras a lot of the sports bras that Ihave have come from Target this oneagain I just really like the color it'svery lightweight it's pretty thin butit's not really supportive if you needthat probably wouldn't work for you butit's just this hot coral and purpleracerback so that's that I found thistank on an end display and this is byMassimo like by the clothing this wasn'tin the workout section but I just reallyliked it it's a racerback tank racerback tank heather gray and black trimand the sizing is weird it's extra smallsmall / petite I think and this fits mereally well and it's really long which Ikind of like I like having longer thingsand then this track jacket which I hadseen one very similar in color to thisone in Lululemon this like really fineheather gray fine fun heather gray andblack I'd see one very similar inLululemon's they didn't have my size sowhen I saw it at Target I picked it upthey had this in a lot of colors butagain I just mostly all the leggingsthat I have are black or gray so I likehaving a track jacket like this becauseit kind of justgoes with everything it has a hooddrawstring and this one was 40 I thinksomething 39.99 and I got it in a smallso that's everything I got from Targetnext I'll share with you the stuff thatI got from Lululemonoh this shirt I've had for awhile it'snot on the website anymore but I havestill seen it in storesit's a beautiful really lightweight verycomfortable lightweight top the back isopen it looks really cool with any kindof you know strappy sports bra Iactually bought this as a top I wouldn'twork out in this I think I would be toohot I tend to go in a sweatshirt or atrack jacket and work out as I getwarmer take it off I know I would justget really claustrophobic working out ina long sleeve top so I got this just asa just as a top because I have somereally pretty strappy bra let's and lacybra let's and they just look really nicewith with this shirt but its sheer andwhite and really pretty I just lovewhite shirt I also found this on sale itwas only 64 I think it was originally128 it is a zip-up pullover and just inblack and it has the little thumb holeson the sleeves the back has a differenttexture detail and and just basic I alsomet this sports bra and I normally wouldnever buy sports bras at Lululemonbecause they're just you can find themat Target so much cheaper but it's grayand white but I just loved the back it'smint green and the insides mint greenreally strappy so I actually have wornthis with that white top and it justlooks really pretty with the mintpopping peeking out the back so I didn'tget this but like I said I would neverbuy like a like a typical sports bra atLululemon cuz there you could just findthem cheaper elsewhere and they got anew pair of black leggings because theones I have are starting to look alittle ready and these go to aboutmid-calf and they have a hint of heathergray at the back of them which I likeand then some sheer netting as well so Ilike this that goes really well with thetrack deck and they showon the top from Target that heatheredgray they're just so comfortable they'reprobably my favorite workout leggingsthey're just so darn expensive but thequality texture the material of them isso much nicer than the ones from fromthe gap the gap cropped leggings are letme just grab a pair so I can show youso these are some that I have from thegap and as you can see like I justwashed these I just put them away fromlaundry they're just very linty theyattract every little piece of lintJake's hair they just it's annoying likestrings they just are a magnet for thatit's just the material of the pants so Iactually wear these more stoic aroundthe house they're out running errandsthan to actually work out and I do wearthem sometimes for working out but Iprefer the kind of like slick smoothmaterial of the Lululemon leggings andthe other ones I'm going to show you inthe home or nylon material up forleggings for working out just because -like when you sweat the ones from thegap tend to feel a lot heavier on butthat's back rat so next the calico lineI am a big big fan of Carrie Underwoodso when I heard she was coming out ofthe workout line I was so excited tojust support her I knew it was gonna bebeautiful you just kind of have afeeling because her fashion choices justnever wrongI found this gorgeous gray heatheredsports bra with again that crossed backdetail and with the coral and peachombre and these were $40 so again like alittle more expensive than I'd like topay for a sports bra but there is a lotof padding really great support reallythick and I just like I love the colorof it so I got that these leggings whichthese are that same kind of nylonmaterial as the Lululemon legging andthey're kind of ruched on the bottomthey kind of go right below your kneeand these were $65 which is right aroundthe price of the gap body or the gapathletic leggings and I just really likethepattern their lien on their flowerypattern but they're black and I have alot of black workout stuff so I thoughtthat they would work really well and Iactually loved the prints so much that Igot it in this top as well not that Iwould wear them together but with justplain black or gray leggings it has abuilt in bra so you have a lot ofsupport I went for the extra smallbecause the small was a little bit bigand I would probably wear this without asports bra so I wanted it to fit alittle bit tighter so I did get theextra small and this was $50 and againit's that same material as the nylonsjust really really pretty so that's notCarrie Underwood's lion also she has alot of like just face loungewear andcomfortable shirts and tops and stuffthat you could wear to yoga really goodstuff but again like nice stuff butprobably more expensive than youraverage like basics to just loungearound in and then while I was at Dick'sI scoured the sale racks and I foundthis really pretty mint jacket I thinkthis was actually like in the golfsection but it's mint green it's azip-up and really comfortable and it was$18 so you can't beat that huge hair andI got these leggings which are verysimilar again in texture to the otherones I just showed you they're gray theback has this the back and the bottomhas the mint green lining and these aremy Under Armour and these were fairlyinexpensive I think they were $34 orsomewhere around there I also obviouslylove the color mint showed you the brathat I had the track jacket and Iactually have sneakers that are grey andlike Tiffany blue / mint so I thoughtthey're really nice I don't know youguys know me I love fashion so it's notlike I'm not going to enjoy afashionable workout clothes - and thelast stuff that I have to show you isfrom Victoria's Secret and these I'vegot they're kind of like open back tanktops so just I like these for doing yogaor like the Zumba class that I takesometimes it'seasy breezy tap I wouldn't wearsomething like this to go runningbecause it's just really soft and itwould really annoy me when I run I liketo just wear stuff that's moreform-fitting that's not gonna annoy meand then I also got this top which iskind of a drapey neck and the back iskind of open so just in a really basicblue and then I found this actuallywhenever you order from Victoria'sSecret they always send you like theclearance catalog and I never do well Ireally don't even look through it allthat much but for some reason I feltprompted to look through the clearancesection and I found this bright pink newfavorite piece of workout gear in therethis track jacket and it was onclearance for $44.99 and I had a secretreward but I thought I was like shockedto see this on clearance because I wouldthink everybody would want a hot pinktrack jacket it has the thumb hole andruching on the sleeves and on the sidesand the sides are a little bit moresheer in color and material then theback and the front and it's just a zipup and has zip pockets which I lovebecause I normally have to have my keyswith me and my cell phone because I liketo listen to music and the last thingI'm going to show you our new pair ofsneakers that I got and I ordered theseI think from Shopbop and they're justbasic New Balances they are black andthey have hot pink laces and I got thesebecause all my leggings are black andbelieve it or not the other sneakersthat I have are really bright andcolorful and don't always work with myneutral stuff so I wanted to get moreblack flash neutral shoes and whodoesn't love pink shoelaces and I wear asize 9 because I have huge feet and youguys like these kind of videos let meknow I know not everybody works out orenjoys the gym I for the longest timehated it just biased it didn't wantanything to do with it so if you aresomeone like that you probably don'twant to see videos like this but I'mjust curiousif you guys like this or not honestly alot of stuff that I buy is for me itdoubles as loungewear it's stuff that Ican just wear around the house or to runerrands or just be comfortable in sojust some good fun colorful basics Ihope that you guys enjoyed this videothank you so much for watching and I'lltalk to you soon bye and the highlighterlooks like a shimmery glitter ball inthe palette but when it goes on yourcheeks it

clothes like when I feel likesexy and confident I just like wanna runoutside where people can see me andworkout harder walk into the weight roomwithout feeling you know subconsciousabout anything so um one other brands Ireally like because I went to Canadawhen I was a lot younger and my mom isreally cool its Lululemon and then eversince then I've just been hooked andI've always thought about like who isLululemon like who is this amazingdesigner who makes these workout clothesthat I love so much and they actuallyjust picked that name randomly theysurveyed a hundred people and chose hisname Lululemon which it works right andthe logo which I was also curious aboutis actually a stylized a like the letterA from my name they didn't pick calledathletically kicked thank God theydidn't pick that name cuz it's not hipmiddle the first jacket I'm superexcited to talk about is the definedjacket and I literally I call it my sexyjacket just it's fitted like around thewaist it's like really tight it's shortand cropped and then also okay if youunzip this top area it's like perfectlyframed your bust which I absolutely loveand another thing is this zipper garageis so great when I get cold and it'slike up here and I'm running like itdoesn't actually it feels good and itlook scratched me at all which is reallynice and I I've cut themselves withthese little lemon zippers like if youlisten to them they're so loud they'relike kind of bigger than normal dippersand they justfeel super secure when you zip them upthey have the same things for the pocketand these pockets are really greatthey're nice and big see and I put myiphone and my keys and whatever in themand then just zip it up halfway and havemy ear have my earphones come out and upto my ear so it's super useful I lovethat um my favorite part thumb holethumb holes are awesome they make myhand warm cuz I get cold all the timeobviously but seriously like they justmake me feel badass I don't know I loverunning with these they help me theyhelp keep the sleeve down which isreally great and the other thing thatthey have honestly are these like flipout mitten parts so when I'm going on arun sometimes I like go pretty farwithout noticing and then I'll come backand it gets really cold so I'll dip upthis top part and I'll put the mittensover and it's just like it feels niceand warm and I just walk home and feelgreatoh this back part this there's a niceawesome big bench back here I don'treally notice it so maybe it's workingright and oh this jacket is made out oflycra and spandex there I'll show itlike stretches beyond amazing like lookat this but the thing is it stays tightand even after I wash it it stays tightand it's just so durable I mean I'vegone climbing and hiking androck-climbing in it it gets so dirty butit's it's great and I love having thisblack color so this is the define jacketit was what I think was $99 such a goodinvestment I've had it for four years solove this guy the second item which isalso my favorite I might as well callthese my sexy pants because they'reactually called the wonder under croppants and lovely creativethis one is it's just really it's reallythick and but it's a totally breathableright it has this like thick material Ilooked it up that's called move on Idon't know what it is it might as welljust be magical material because it'ssuper Hardy and stretchable and it haslike this four-way stretch but justkeeps everything together and I feellike I can almost wear you know any kindof underwear it has this large band atthe top which on the website theyactually call it like a muffin topprotector or something but ladies it'strue right like you're in Bikram yoga oryou're walking around in your sports brayou want to feel good in it and thenactually it's everything contained andmakes you feel greatwhat else oh I bought these and I thinkthree weeks later I realized there'slike this extra fabric here in the frontkeep the key pocket for running justbraid it ever since I found that outI'll just put my key and pull up somemoney inside here and I'll keep my phoneand my like a perfect card and my jacketand it's just like the perfect runningoutfit these pants and my deviceso these are the water under crop pantsthat really are pretty wonderful this isthe run bundle up jacket and I actuallygot itthis last winter I think totally justbecause of style just cuz I thought itlooked cute it has this dark teal andlike these contrasting colors they alsohave it in white which makes you looklike a snow princess I tried it on but Igot this color because I thought I couldwear it more often without full noticingthat I'm wearing it all the time and Iactually turns out I really love it formore practical reasons than why I boughtit for style reasons in the first placeso it has like two zippers actually it'sperfect for when it's really windy butthen you have this part here as well butyou can also remove it this whole thinglike with the hoodie the entire thingcomes off so I've never actually takenmine off because it's so nice importantso I love it something else is this buffpart is genius I I bought this jacketfor style like I said but I brought itwith me to snowboarding because it's sowarm it's made out of goose down andwhen you like sit on those cold chairsoutside and you knowyou resort or whatever this keeps yourbutt warm and keeps your buck from beingsold which is really nice and I wouldhave to say if there's one thing I don'treally like about it is this hoodiecomes off really easily they have likethis little like magnetic thing thatjust kind of stays along like thatotherwise when it comes off see if youmom pretty easily the whole thing islike open so when you put it on it'slike a little hard to navigate butseriously it is so cute and it is sowarmsuch a good investment I've gotten somany compliments on this guy this jacketis around $200 I think so it's a prettygood investment but man I've taken itwith me to the desert for off-roadingwith my family aware that night and tolike the snow and to hiking and do abunch of different things and I also Ijust look where it's a glass-like aftermynice warm so super useful for a lot ofdifferent so yeah I love this bundle I'mdoing itthat is my Lululemon review like I saidI really bought all these things justbecause I thought there were greatfashion items but turns out like they'resuper practical everything is extremelyform-fitting durable like good forsweating hiking whatever and that's whyI really keep going back to Lululemonjust because it works out for me for allthe different activities I do and it'salso really stylish and that's what forme that's most important when you feelgood when you're wearing somethingathletic then you just want to workharder and that's why I wanted to dothis review and share these things withyou guys cuz that's not the feeling thatyou should be looking for when you arebuying workout clothes you know theyalso have a lot of

hi everyone this video is going to beall about cute little skirts I havewhole bunch of Spurs to show you guysthat all those skirts are from LululemonLululemon is a store that specializes onathletic wear for exercises and yoga andthat kind of stuff I'm sure most of youguys have heard about it and I have beenshopping from Lululemon for I would sayever since they opened and throughoutthe years I've collected a lot of theirpieces and I especially like their cutelittle tennis skirts so this one righthere it's calledrun will power skirt that's the frontand this is the back and the back hasthis cute little zipper pocket where youcan maybe stick in some cash or cashcard and all of the little lemon skirtsthese cute little kind of skirt type ofstuff have shorts underneath I got totell you guys a funny story my parentstold me that a couple of weeks ago whenthey were at a shopping mall and theywere going up the escalator they sawthis young girl maybe in her mid-20ssomething like that we're in reallyshort short skirt and beside that herbutt was hanging out like she was raiseda short skirt like this and I guess shewas ring songs org-string underneath and my parents arevery old and conservative there are 6065 and they go to church and they justwere so embarrassed for herthey obviously looked away but that justwas not enough and they were just soembarrassed so when they saw me wearinga small little skirts like this theywere like please tell us that you wereat least wearing something underneath tocover your butt and yeah and I tolddon't worry I'm wearing these littlelemon skirts they all come with theseShores underneath okay so this run gopower skirt is what I'm wearing sorryI'm so out of breath today so this one Ireally like because it's got thiswatercolor design and it's got bit ofthis fluffiness which is kind of inright now in the back has the littlezipperget and the front here has these twohidden pockets here to where you canprobably stick in a key or maybe justlike a dollar bill or two that kind ofstuffand mostly I love these first lipstickbecause they're so comfortable they'reso comfortable and you don't have toworry about you know your butt stickingout or your underwear showing becauseall of those skirts have these shortsand these shorts and have these elasticband going around so that they don'twrite up all that much which is anothergood idea so I love these little lemonskirts for casual like walking the dogmaybe going for a jog or even hangingout with friends or going to the mall Iwould actually wear this to a shoppingtoo I don't see why you can because alot of the clothing brands right now areactually releasing cute little skirtslike this for casual wear or even goingout alright so this one again it's runwillpower skirt this is a run willpowerskirt in size two in white so as you cansee I mean I could wear this to go out Ihave seen skirtsthat look like this that's sure and kindof fluffy at the bottom for going outpurposes and these are the fabrics areamazing they're so beautiful andcomfortable okay so this is the whiteone another skirt that I bought thisseason so this one this white one here Istill have the tag on so you guys knowthat I recently bought it and I alsobought this one and this one the onethat I was first wearing so these threeare from this season and I think thatyou can still get it at stores so thisone here I forget what it's called butit's very cute I think this is thecutest one that I haveokay so I'll put it up for you guys sothis one has lots of layers it's gotthis first layer that's just black andyou getthis thin light pink layer and the backhas three layers this and this thing andthis thing so it looks it looks like Ihave bunch of layers the back the backsreally cute okay and as with mostLululemon skirts it's got this zipperpocket and the shorts underneath so thisone is my absolute favorite I love thisone it's so cute so it does have thisbit of puff here next I'm going to showyou guys two skirts that I got last yearso these two skirts are very similarlydesigned but just different color soI'll try on the orange one first andthen this checkered one so the orangeone this one I bought it more for thecolor I love how bright this orange iskeep the puffiness it doesn't actuallygo sideways it goes front and backinstead which is a little different andthen this one actually doesn't havepocket at the back like most otherskirts do but it does have these drawstrings here by tied up and it has thisone zipper pocket of the side so thisskirt also has the shorts and the shortsof this one is an orange so next weekthat I have on here it's another runningskirt and it's called leader of thetrack skirt and it was $64 when I boughtit last year I only wore it for thefirst time this year that's why I stillhave this tag so this one it's verysimilar to the orange one that I showedyou it's got this drawstring tie in thefront and it has a zipper pocket at theside so it has no pocket of the back andit's puffy in the front like thisand the back I don't know if you guyscan see it's got its bit scrunched uphere that's why it's puffy and it'sscrunched up at the back too and thisone of course has these cute littleshorts underneath so this one here is avery first Lululemon square that Ibought and this is called run speedskirt I usually wear a size two but backwhen Lululemon first came out theydidn't have size two skirts so this oneis actually in size four and it stillfits me okay you can see that it couldbe a little bit fitted it was maybe likethat it would be better but I still likeit a lot so this looks more like atraditional tennis skirt it's got thepleadings at the back the front has thiswaistband there are draw strings that'sinside that I could you know tighten upor not the drawstrings I like to justkeep it inside so this is subscribethat's the back the back does have thislittle pocket here but it doesn't haveany zippers so I wouldn't recommendputting money in here maybe just like alike a membership card or something foryour gym okay so this is a really -tennis board I wore to play tennis andof course it has the shorts underneathand this shorts actually has this meshedinsert where you can stick in yourtennis ball you guys are probablywondering what this was first rate Iactually wonder what this was at first -I mean I suppose you can stick in mmm Idon't know like a golf ball will be toosmall it'll probably fall out so thosebig you know tennis ball you can stickin here okay so that's the run speedskirt actually have a few different runspeed skirts because I just love howthey're designed I loved pleating sothis isn't like a deeper blue colorindigo blue I would say so I love thepleat like the backand this one is actually in size too soit's a little bit smaller than the lightblue one alright so I'm going to showyou guys one last skirt which is anotherrun speed skirt but it's in white sothis skirt is exactly same as light blueone that I showed as well as the darkblue one but the light blue one that Ibought I would maybe like three threefour years ago this one has that meshedinsert for the tennis ball right but thenewer ones like this indigo color one aswell as this white one it doesn't havethat I guess Lululemon decided this thatthis tennis ball insert thing is uselessbecause it really is unless you're anactual tennis player wearing the skirtyeah alright so this white one is sameas these two it's got the pleadingswhich are so cute it's got the pocket atthe back and drawstring inside and theshorts okay so that is it for all theLululemon skirts that I'm going to showyou guys in this video so I hope youguys enjoyed my video about little lemonskirts if you guys are interested gocheck out a little em'ly stores or theydo have online store also and sometimesyou can find a little lemon wear on eBayfor cheaper than retail so don't forgetto check out eBay and yeah Lululemonhas come a long way since they firstbeget in my opinion in the beginning Isaw them as strictly like athletic yogawear clothing store but now I wear a lotof their clothing just casually or evento the office they have really cutesweaters sometimes and just pulloversand comfortable pants if you're lookingfor tights that's kind of durable notlike this cheap ten dollar one bluelemon has great variety of tights alsookay so let me know what you guys getbecause I am a little em'ly phonetic soif you tell me like the name of thisthat you got or you're gonna get Iprobably know what you're talking aboutall right so if you have any questionsfeel free to ask me down below and I'lltry to get back to you as soon as I canI,26,UCoKAOzyQLp8VHgJFg41RhIQ,Beauty Bemused,13,14,0,98,"['summer fashion', 'short skirt',

hi everyone its Veronica and as you maynotice I did get my hair cut and coloredtoday so it's a little shorter I'm inthe link i got my layers redone and Ihad it highlighted and low lighted andmost of the time just to explain I onlyget my hair highlighted and my hair justconsists of my natural brown color andsome blond highlights but on this timemy stylist about every third or fourthtime I'll also have low lights put inbecause if you've ever had blondehighlights done before you know that ifyou keep putting in wand over and overand over and over you're eventuallygoing to end up with all blonde hair andI definitely do not want that I'vealways you know I used to be blown backin the day and I did that for aboutthree years and I just think brunettehair suits me better but I do like tohave a little lightness to it and i dowant to let you know that i am going tofilm a video all about communicatingwith your stylist and just saying how tocommunicate to them exactly what you'relooking for in your haircut in your haircolor how to go about that how to havethe best relationship with your stylisthow to find a great style so I'm goingto make a separate video for that butthis actual video is going to be a haulvideo as you can tell i know i just gotmy hair done it totally doesn't lookstyled because um i have i was at themall all day and i'm actually losingdaylight right now so i'm usingartificial light so i hope that thatLighting's good but anyways i was at themall day I was trying things on you knowtaking things on and off over my head somy curls have fallen out but let's getto the shopping I did go to gilly hickstoday I'm like obsessed with that storelately I don't know why because it'slike so not a store that's like fourpeople my age even but they have thecutest stuff and it's not like you knowvictoria secret pink i really love theirstuff but some of their stuff is like alittle too young and even though this islike a young store I kind of feel liketheir colors and styles are a littlemore mature so look how cute the bag isit's like little navy with little redpolka dots I just thought that wasreally cute and they were having apromotion on their underwear so rightnow both victoria secret and gilly hicksare doing seven pairs of underwear soGilly Hicks has seven pairs for 25 50and victoria secret pink has seven pairsfor 26 and then that includes thevictoria secret cotton as well so i didpick up seven pairs of underwear but youknow i don't want me to show those inthis video but i'm going to show you theother things i got which were also allon sale the first thing is this tank topand oh it's inside out my apologies thisis just a striped tank top and it's gotthe little lace detailing at the neckand the shoulders and it was originally2450 and i got it for thirty percent offand it's it's like a nice stretchyfabric I just think this is really cutefor like layering under different thingsand lounging around I just thought itwas feminine and pretty and it was areally good price I picked up that andthen I got a pair of these little sleepshorts and they're just like a chequeredkind of plaid pattern and then they havethis little satin bow to secure them andthen they have the little ruffles on thebottom and they just they just reallylike reminded me of the holidays and umthey just reminded me of Christmas and Ireally love like getting like specialpjs around the holidays so these arereally cute in the back they're justnormal and then the last thing asidefrom the underwear that I picked up arethese adorable they're like I don't evenknow what these are there like leggingpants and I did get these in a sizelarge and these stores tend to have likejunior sizing so I I tend to either getmediums or larges and everything inthese stores because the sizing isreally small and these are like leggingsso they have like this little satin bowand then they have this cute littlepocket on the front and then they'rejust they just go all the way downpretty much and it's like a legging andthenthis on the bottom and they're justreally like they're so soft and snugglyand they just feel really good so thesewere on sale from 3450 and they were onsilver 20 so I really like theseactually kind of regret not getting themin more colors because they are like theperfect lounging pants like you knowsometimes like sweatpants can tend to bebaggy and like they're like kind of twohot sometimes so these are like warm butthey're more lightweight than sweatpantsand they're more fitted so I just thinkthey look cuter than the averagesweatpants so that's what those looklike and then I really treated myselftoday and I totally was not expecting toget anything from this store but as soonas i saw this i loved it and a lot ofyou know that most of my workout clothesare from Lululemon i really love thatstore i think their quality is amazingyes it's expensive but i have stuff fromthere from five or six years ago thatit's still going strong so definitelyhighly recommend the store and last yearthere was this like zip up jacket therethat I really loved but they never hadit in the pattern I wanted in the size Ineeded so I never was able to get it butthis year um they had a beautiful jacketand I was able to get it and they havethese awesome bags there right now I'musually they're red and white but theyhave the little black and white ones soI thought that was cool that I could getthis special bag um and then I just usethese bags for like my groceries andbring my lunch to work and stuff so thesweater that I got is this amazingmaterial and it this one has a hood andit just has like the i'll post a link toit if i can find it online but it justhas like the lululemon logo on the frontI don't really know if the cameraspicking that up and then it's got thehood and then it's got the sleeves withthe little thumb holes so you can kindof see it right there it's got likelittle little thumb holes up the sleevesand it just looks I'm gonna have to posta picture of me wearing this because itjust looks so slimming and beautiful onthe body and it's a combination of thisblack fabric and like thisray and black I can't even describe it'snot like a herringbone or anything butit's kind of like a herringbone liketexture and I just really love it and itwas kind of pricey but like I said theseare investment pieces and this issomething that I would wear like everyday to you know over my tank top to thegym this is like the kind of jacket Iwould wear just zipped up on weekends umrunning errands and things like that soI know I'll get a lot of use out of thisand then lastly something I bought thisweek that I want to kind of do a minireview on as well is the Bears a spabronzer sunless spray so a lot of youhave probably heard of bears a spa it'slike a tanning system it's like a spraytan system that a lot of salons offerand you basically pay like thirty-fiveor forty dollars that's the cost at mostplaces I've been to and you stand in themachine and it's crazy so it's notMystic Tan it's bears a spa so there's Iguess there's two and their competitorsbut I've never ever heard good thingsabout Mystic Tan so I've just alwaysdone the vs. saw but the last time Iwent and got a spray tan I noticed thatthey sold an aerosol can of the sameproduct that's in the machines and I andit's it's forty dollars so FYI the st.Tropez bronzer that I got at sephora inmy friends and family sale haul returnedit like I tried to use that stuff on mybody and I was I was horrified I mean myhusband was like oh my god like you looklike you rolled around in mud like therewere brown streaks everywhere I mean Iwas trying to like apply it evenly butit was drying quickly and like I when Irubbed it would just stay like dark inone spot and look normal in the other Imean I literally like did my whole bodyin it and I freaked out and I jumped inthe shower and just washed it all offbecause I was like oh my gosh I cannotpossibly go to sleep like this becauseif I you know I was worried when I wouldwake up i have like streaks all over meso I returned it got my full refund backso it's the same price both products orforty dollars I think I've come to theconclusion that airbrush formulaher self tanning are really the best wayto go because there's the least amountof air in it in my opinion when you havea lotion you know you have to make sureyou got and everywhere you rub it inthis has a bronzer mixed in so you cansee where you spray it and all you needis a fine mist over every area of yourbody to get a good result so anywaysback to this so forty dollars for thiscan and I thought well you know if I'malready paying $35 just get one spraytan you know if this last me two orthree tans it's basically paid foritself so i did use this on gosh whendid I use this on Thursday nah no onwhen I did use this on Thursday nightand I did my whole body and it woke uphad a perfect han you know it give itgives great color really even resultsyou know obviously it takes a teeny bitof practice like i did miss after Ilooked at myself after I screed it hadto touch up a few spots because Inoticed i missed a few spots but that'swhy it's so great it has the bronzer init because you know you can really tellif you've missed something so I reallylove this product so far i'm going touse it another time to really see how itcompares to other like cheaper formulasbut since it's the same stuff that theyuse in the actual booth i just thought iwould give this a try and see if it'sworth the money to spend it on the canversus going and getting into that thesalon so like this and i will reportback once I've used it more and then thelast thing I wanted to share with youall is actually something that I'mreally excited about I was sent this onehundred percent pure argan oil by acompany called cydia organics it comesin a little bottle like this has like acute little tassel and this is actuallylike pure argan oil like a lot of brandshave argan oil in them like Moroccan oilwhich I also own that which you can useon your hair but this is like the purestform of it so it doesn't have likeartificial smells it smells like kind ofnutty like what real argan oil wouldsmell like and I've been using this forthe last couple weeks and one of theuses I use it for that was recommendedto me by the lovely woman who sends itto me is to use it as a deepconditioning treatmentovernight on my hair and you know nowthat I've got my hair cut I really wantto prioritize keeping my ends healthybecause I do tend to get a lot ofbreakage and split ends so what I'vebeen I've already done this before I gotmy hair cut and I'm just going tocontinue doing it is one night a weekusually on Sunday night before I go tobed I'll put some of this oil in myhands and I'll put it on all the ends ofmy hair and then I'll clip it up in oneof my little clips and just sleep withit in my hair overnight and then when Iwake up in the morning and I wash myhair and condition and shower it justfeels really soft and smooth becauseit's been infused with that oilovernight so it's really soaking up thatmoisture and then another thing I usethis for believe it or not I've beenputting this on my face yes I know Iknow it's crazy because my skin sosensitive and I like I'm so weary ofusing anything on my face but this issuch a pure oil I just you know Itrusted the person who sent it to me andshe said that she uses it on her skinand it really helps with moisturizingand i have to say i have used this on myskin it has not broken me out i've beenusing it to treat one fine line that ihave on my forehead and then one day ihad like a really bad pimple and likeright around right around this area andthis week and once it started to finallyheal it was really red and it waspeeling actually it's probably likestill peeling every single day but wheni get a pimple my pimple tends to likeheal and then it's really red and itfeels like it's this whole process so ithought like I wonder if putting this onovernight will help you know with thepeeling with the healing and let me tellyou I really do think I've noticed adifference in how quickly my skin ishealing and how much less peeling I'mhaving when using this overnight so I'vereally been enjoying this and then theexciting part about this is that I'mactually in the next couple weekshosting a giveaway on my blog so one ofmy readers can win a whole gift gift boxfull of products from this company fullof argan oil products so I'm reallyexcited so my blog I'm a

very good affordableprice at winners if you're not fromCanada and don't know what winners isit's pretty much like a Marshallst.j.maxx I decided I was going to sharewith you guys all of my earthly awarethat I have collected over the past yearor so so just let you guys can keep aneye out for certain things to look outfor I know with me I like to go in andout sometimes I get lucky with findingsomething but I do like to browse reallyquickly but yeah if you've beenfollowing me on here for a while thenyou know that I keep saying I want tostart working out a lot more and I feellike so far I've been doing pretty wellI'll do like two three times a week butI feel like for the past two weeks it'sbeen really bad although some peoplemight not wear workout clothes to workout it's very trendy now to wear it justwalking around I like to wear my stuffto go to the movies just so I look alittle bit more put together than with alittle hoodie or whatever or oversizedt-shirt even a tank top like I'm wearingright now by the way this is one that Igot from Zara if you guys want to see myZara haul I'll link it right up here anddown below so you guys can check thatout but yeah before I keep rambling onand on let me show you the goodies thatI have found so first up we have theseNike pro leggings these are the dry fitin a size medium I could have gone asmall for sure but the medium still fitsfine I like the color of it and thenit's got this a little bit of a meshdown here these are really reallycomfortableI believe I only got them for like maybe$29.99 for $30 they're reallycomfortable they're not see-through atall I've gone to the outlets before whenthey have their sales and these arereally expensive so the fact that Icould find them at winners for $30 isreally really good one of my sistersactually really likes to work out andshe buys pretty much like all herleggings from there she's obsessed withworkout gear and she knows a lot aboutfabrics and the quality of themshe used to own like a lot of Lululemonstuff and the more expensive stuff andnow that she's been finding them likemarshals and winners that's where Ilearned all of my stuff room and becauseshe works out a lotshe knows what fabrics weren't the bestfor like sweating a lot what's mostcomfortable what's more breathable soyeah I've learned a lot a lot from herthe next brand that I have is from ohgosh I don't even want to say itmy dica which is something not good inSpanish but I got these in a size smallthese are really cute purple ones I lovelove love the color of them I kind ofwish I went with a medium on these justbecause they are a lot more snug likeit's hard to bend my knees but they'reso cute that I still wear them like Ican't I just can't get rid of them thequality is really nice it almost feelslike suede which I really like I believethis is a brand from LA yeah they'rereally really comfortable this isprobably one of the first brands that Ifound at winners and was really happywith so happy that I actually ended upgoing and getting another pair theseones are black some grey almost lookslike a little thunderstorm going on onthese but they go all the way down tothe ankle I like leggings that go allthe way down to the ankle I feel alittle weird when they come up like madcats like it just does not look reallygood on me some people can get away withit it's just not for me but again thesealmost feel like suede they're reallyreally comfortable these are in the sizemedium I've worn them to like you can'teven see the label on the back anymoreyou can only see this one right overhere oh yeah in case you're wonderingthat is the label mark and it's calledthe medium-sized ones are a lot morecomfortable for me they give me a lot ofroom I like when leggings come up tolike my belly button or even over itjust makes me feel so much more snugbecause you know when you're working outsometimes I do work out or even when I'mstretching in the morning your stomachkind of hangs for me anyways I don'tknow if it's a mental thing but it helpsme keep my core tighten cuz I'm like ohyeah everything's tight there keep ittight end you got a better workout uplike that and it's so good for your corethe only thing that I will sayabout these ones though and I'm not sureif it's because I've worn them so muchlike you can't can't even see the labelon here but it's a little see-through Idon't know if you guys can see that fromhere but I have noticed that over thecouple months you can see your underwearI don't like to wear it full underwearwe're not wearing leggings either I justdon't like when you can see yourunderwear line I don't know why thatjust me or do you guys get bothered bythat I don't know cuz I have fullunderwear I love wearing fault underwearnot just when it's that time of monthbut I don't like when other people cansee that I'm wearing fall undoing andthen another brand that I love love loveI have three pairs of these because I'mobsessed with them it's from the brandcalled kayo Dan I think that's how youpronounce it and it's got this little Kright over here and this is by far myfavorite favorite brand any time I seethis brand hanging around in there Ialways have to get the pairs if theyhave one two three I'm taking them offone there are the most comfortablecomfortable leggings I've ever worn everand I love the fact that they alwayshave pockets these ones on the side Ilove to put my phone in there and mycredit card my debit card a lip gloss Ithey have them on either side nothingwill ever fall out because they're sosnug but they're still breathableI think this brand is actually fromMontreal but I could be wrong and I alsoheard that this brand is a sister brandfrom Lululemon because they're sosimilar to the Lululemon brand if youwarn the Lululemon pants before then youknow that those are perfect they fit yougreat fabric is great they're reallywell done what the price is reallyexpensivehowever these I swear feel the exactsame and I get these for $30 actuallyI'm lying there $24.99 just like theseones that I showed you guys before$24.99 but they fit so well I also havethem in this blue it's almost like adusty light blue and then Ikind of cuts it off right here this isright below the knee so it doesn'treally bother your knee when you'rebending and stuff again it goes all theway down to your ankle this is also in asize small I only get these in a sizesmall because they're the ones that fitthe besthowever these ones don't have thepockets on the side they actually haveit right in here and then it's got roomover here on the side so you can justpush it in you know what I mean I lovethe band of these it just suckseverything right in the color of this Ireally needed to start doing more colorin my leggings and this is just reallycute and then these green ones that Ijust picked up that actually inspired meto do this video for you guys this is areally light gray again it has thepocket on the sides here both sides andall the way down to the ankle they justfit so well with your body and this oneactually feels a little bit more like abathing suit fabric so if here's someonethat really works so you know thatthat's gonna help out with the sweatingso this along with the shorts that arewearing right now are the last two thatI had purchased and I got them the lastweekend actually and I'm obsessed withthe shorts as you can see right hereit's got the little zipper on the side Ilike that it comes up over my bellybutton it's got the little K at thefront too and I like that it glows whenthere's light shining on it as well Ibought a pair of bicycle shorts frommarizia a while ago maybe two threemonths ago now I wear them all the timebut I only had the one pair so I waskind of waiting for their sale to go onso that I could get the same pair but ina different color then from the TNAbrand and they're really reallycomfortablethose are thirty-three dollars I believewhich is still a pretty good price butwhen I found these kiyo Dan Schwartz atwinners for only I think it was 16.99 Ijust I had to get them and they havestorage space I had to get them thefabric of the shorts as well as reallybreathable really nice snug the moveswith your body which is really importantfor me I don't want to be uncomfortablewhen things are tight and I can't movethere's restriction so that's it for theleggings and

you're like Sharpay Evans fromhighschool musical life hello YouTubewelcome back to my channelI'm happy new year it's 2018 which isridiculous because I'm getting oldertoday's video has nothing to do aboutthe new year because it doesn't also Icome to you with a bare face and asweatshirt because it's cold and I haveno one to impress on the internet todayI am going to be talking about Lululemonwhich if you don't know what Lululemonis Google is now your best friend I havea love-hate relationship with this brandbecause I love the clothes but then mybank account hates me today I'm going tobe going over three of my favoriteleggings from Lululemon and explainingwhy I love them which one I think wouldbe a good investment if you have nevershopped at Lululemon or you're curiousabout which leggings are really worth itand then also what they are designed forso like I said I have a love-haterelationship with Lululemon I have likeda lot of leggings these are not allfolded clearly I prepared for this videothese are all Lululemon leggings I don'teven know how many this is oh my godokay one two three four we're on SesameStreet now we're learning how to count 56 7 8 9 okay so these are 9 pairs ofleggingsthat's like $900 I'll never get back Ihate myself oh my godalright so the three pair of leggings Imay be talking about are the wonderunders the align pants and the all theright places pant so we're gonna stoprambling and we're gonna get right intothe videothe first thing we're gonna talk aboutis the wonder underpant this is a greatintroductory pant to Lululemon it'sprobably one of their most popular pantsI think most people when they go toLululemon that's probably one of thefirst pants that they buy and with goodreasonthis pant is very versatile for aLululemon pant although it says on thewebsite that it's specifically designedfor yoga and training which I assumethey mean training in the gym you canreally do a lot of things with it so ifyou do a lot of different activities oryou're really not sure about where tostart in terms of Lululemon attire the100 pant is a great introductory pantthis is a wonder under pants what itlooks like I'll also have a picture fromthe website so you can see what it lookslike on a person it comes in differentfabrics their main fabric is luan fabricit sort of reminds me like it's like acotton kind of lycra blend it's reallyreally nice because it's stretchy but italso holds everything together there isa slight compression feel which i thinkis greatthese are the high rise 1 or unders Ipretty much buy all high rise pants Ilike the way they fitI am very tall I'm 6 feet so I like thewide waistband I feel like it sits on mywaist better I'd also keeps me frombeing worried about the muffin topespecially with the holidays cuz Iprobably ate enough food to feed afamily of 4it does hug things and I don't have toworry about it rolling down it feelsgreat the fabric is very comfortable andit moves with you the only thing I hadto say about this pant that is a littlebit frustrating as I feel like the onerunners pill a lot faster than some ofthe other leggings I have like two ofthem have like a ton of pilling and liketwo of them are like hanging on andthey're like doing you know they'recopacetic over here so I don't know ifit's like just depends like it's aguessing game like it's mystery bugs Idon't know if I'm gonna be a pilling butit does happen more on these pants I'venoticed in some of the other leggingsthat I have so it's just a caution watchout for that pilling the next pant we'regonna talk about is the aline pant andwhen the align panthers came out all thefitness youtube influencers were on itI saw every Instagram video I was seeingevery workout video on YouTube everylike fitness clothing Hall was like alion pant line pant line pant islife-changing so naturally I had to getup I have quite a few pairs of linepants I do have to say the fabric isamazing it is a special fabric nativechaloo lemon it's called new lu fabricit's very very soft compared to theirother leggings it fits like a secondskin my dogs are barking because theyhate me and they don't want me to filmthis video we'll wait so the new Lufabric is really really soft if it'slike a second skin it's designed to havea sort of naked feel which i think isreally true I do really like that thealine pants are pretty thin in materialbut they are SWAT proof the greatestthing that has ever happened to thesepants have been like only a few monthsago they came out with a full length alion pant so when the aligners came outthey were sort of the 7/8 length and forsomeone who's really tall if I did notshave my ankles actually was like I didnot shave like this amount of leg fromlike the ankle up it was all back sothey came out with the a-line fulllength and it is life-changing andprobably my favorite thing ever likewe're talking Sound of Music these are afew of my favorite things thingsunfortunately the full length alignpants are online only which is weird butthey're there on the Internet quickstory about when I bought these pantsthe Alliance the original pens for thefirst time how many times can i saypants i was stopped by like three peoplein the store who worked there and theywere like oh my god and getting new linepants and I was like yeah oh my godwould and like we had a moment and thenthey were like what are you gonna dowith those and I was like do they thinkI'm stealing them am i doing somethingillegal what just happenedlike they got serious for a second I waslike what just happened but really whatthey were asking me is what activities Iwaswith them because apparently you are notsupposed to do a lot of cardio in thesepants even though on the website and Iwill show you a screenshot with itcircled it says sweat wicking but you'reapparently not supposed to sweat in thembecause it ruins the fabric the ladyliterally told me that these are usedfor yoga or lounging I don't know why onearth anyone would spend $98 forlounging pants you get yourself down totarget by sweatpants for $12.99 put themon and lounge lounge and luxury becauseyou just saved yourself like another $90I mostly use them at the gym liftingweights and so I don't know if Imentioned this there are also $98 sothose same prices the wonder unders ifyou're torn between the two and you'venever tried Lululemon I would definitelysay just get the Wonder Hunters firstunless you like really want the linepants then be free my child and go withmy blessing the last pair of pants thenI'm gonna talk about are the all theright places but I don't know why I saidit like that but they fit all the rightplaces all the right places areunfortunately also online only just likethe align full links these are probablyactually one of my favorite Lululemonpantsthe main reason they're my favorite isbecause I don't know if you think theseare the all the right places pants allinsert picture actually one sort ofclose the picture of why this is myfavorite but I'm going to show you rightnow they have a pocket look at thisstop barking this is probably likemildly Audrey this is not code foranything but they have a pocket yes theyhave a pocket and it makes me excitedhalf the time I forget they have apocket and then I'm like whoa they havea pocket and then I put my phone inthere and the world is right again theseare more compression e and like tightfeelings then the one rounders not in abad way it's not like oh I need to sizeup because these are really small andtight it's just like they have a bettercompression feel and that's anotherreason I like them because they justshow everything in likeit's like a corset for your legs do theymake corsets for your legs I have toknow google it let me know and we'lllink me to that these pants like theWonder owners are great for a lot ofdifferent activities you can do cardioyou can lift weights yoga you name ityou can do it in here in this there are128 dollars so it's kind of a little bitof a jump in price from the one runnersand the Alliance but if you either havesome Lululemon pants and you're thinkingabout trying a different one or you'recommitted to making that investmentanyways I highly suggest getting a pairof these they last a really long timethere isn't really anything bad I cansay about these pants I just really likethem so yeah get a pair thank you

it's a pull on addiction people hi guysI am here with a Lululemon haul for younothing like starting off the new yearand all your New Year's resolutions I'ma little bit of swag right so I wentinto Lululemon the other day kind ofunintentionally I mean sometimes youknow you go in there and you're like ohlet's see if they have any new stuff andbefore you know it you're walking outand you just spent your entire lifesavings on workout stuff that youprobably will just wear to the grocerystore not the gym or is that just me soI thought that I would share some of mygood little finds with you some of thesethings I purchased myself and then acouple of them I actually got forChristmas from my sister so in my momcouple gifts a couple things that Ibought as well so let's get started I'mjust going to hold them out of thislovely bag here if you guys don't knowthe Lululemon bags themselves areamazing like I use them to take lunchwell I mean not this size alone but theyhave smaller ones and those are greatlike little lunch bags for school justsaying okay so the first thing that Ihave here this is actually a top and Ithis is a newer top by Lululemon it'scalled the in hearten tank I will try toput pictures of like the clothes on themodels because I'm not gonna be tryingthem on for you sorry I'm in likesweatpants and a hoody so it's just nothappening today but I will do my best toget pictures so that you can see whatthey look like on a person so this isthe in hearten top and I like it becauseit does have a built in shelf bra so tobe honest unless I'm doing cardio likehigh in our wall training or you knowrunning on the treadmill or anythinglike that I just wanting wear a bra Shhthis does just fine it holds up justfine so this is the tank right here it'skind of hard to see I know because it'sblack but it's just a black tank and Ilike that the it is a scoop neck but itgoes up kind of high so it doesn't showoff all the goodies at the gym and thenit is kind of like if you have a pair ofunders it's the same kind of material asthat and then the back is what's reallycute it kind of has this like crisscrossback thing going on so it gives the backa little bit of a design and I actuallyalready did wear that and it's reallyreally nice I uh I went back on thewebsite after I wore it like franticallytrying to see if they had other colorsand they didn't they only had black andwhite so I'm hoping that they bring outsome more colors because that's a reallyreally nice top another thing that I gotand I did already wear these as wellthese are their joggers and they'reactually called the base runner 3 sowhat these are is they are stretchyright in here and they have a drawstringand they're not as tight as the Wonderunders or any sort of legging but not asloose as a typical sweat pant so it justkind of skins the leg a little bit andthen the N has my sanity and then theend has these kind of little cuts on thebottom so it kind of holds in at thebottom like a sweat pant would butthey're just way more attractive thanwearing sweat pants outside so again Iwear these if I'm just gonna go to thegym and lift weights not necessarily ifI'm gonna do a lot of cardio but theback what I really like about the backis that it's not a typical sweat pantfoot like it doesn't give you campbut oh they actually like hug your buttlike wonder unders wood so it's a lotmore feminine and it's a lot moreflattering but they are super supercomfortable absolutely no love thehandles with these at all they're justlike they're kind of my lounging pantsas well so not gonna be lyin to yousometimes I just wear these at home butbase runner three amazing pair of me ohthese are my favorite pants of life fromLululemon these are called the high xpant and like the Wonder unders they'rea very stretchy legging type materialhowever the High Times pant you guessedit they have a higherso really like hugs in that gut and itjust makes it much more flattering Iguess you could say there's absolutelyno love handles that go on with wearingthese pants because they go up higher soit kind of sets you all in and these arecalled 7/8 pants so if you go on theLululemon site and you search for themthere under the 7/8 pant tat so they'renot pants like they're not full-lengthpants they're not crops that are rightin between on a normal person so on anormal person they hit probably aboutlike low calf nothing plumps up she'slike trying to pounce on me they willhit about like the lower calf but on meI'm five five so five five are in oneshorter they'll be like a whole lengthpant so I mean they just hit like rightat the ankle which is perfect and thenokay I could show up in just a second sothese are the great ones and againthey're just like leg skimming pantsthat are very stretchy very tight andthis wide waistband see how it's like alot wider than a typical wonder underany sort of liking that you probablyhave and that's what's gonna do a reallygood job of like sucking you in so I gotthose in gray and it is the softestmaterial ever they're very very verysoft and then I also got them in thisblack pair and I haven't worn this blackpair yet it's a little bit of adifferent material it says on here Iwant to feel hugs so these are theirhugged mine I guesshugs sensation is engineered to feellike a comfortable embrace the classicstyle hold do quotes and moves with youso in other words that's nice for sayingit sucks you in so that you look moresvelte I guess so again the Lululemonlogo in the back it does have the higherwider waistband to really hold you inand then again these are 7/8 pants so onme they hit right on my ankle which isamazing because I don't have to get themhemmedthey just fit perfectlyand again this material is differentthan the longer unders this particularone but the high times pant you can getthem in a bunch of different materialsthis one is the high x pant in full luxeum I'm not really sure what that meansit's ful lu x but it feels differentthan any other Lululemon pants that Iown and when I tried these on they werelike whoa squeeze you in like whoa Iprobably look like 10 pounds lighterwell we're sorry they're amazing um andthen another top that I got this is thecool racerback I have about a hundred ofthese not really but I do have a ton ofthese because they're just the easiesttank tops ever to wear like alone with asports bra or like with a pool and ajacket or any sort of like hoodies ifI'm putting anything like that so let metake off the tag um this is hot hot pinkI believe this is called raspberry glowlight so if you're on the websitelooking for these colors that's whatthis color is if this colors makes mehappy I mean really so it's just a scoopneck racerback top and I just this colorthis color is giving me life that makesme wish it was summertime so that isthat top I have a bunch of differentcolors on that one and what I like aboutthose is that they're thinner butthey're not too thin where you see everylike imperfection on your body andthey're long so you can get them hemmedif you want if you didn't know you canget anything hemmed a little lemon forfree it's just you got to obviously dropit off and wait for them to do it butthough hem like shorten these shirts alittle bit if you don't want it so longbut if you're super super tall this isgoing to be plenty long enough for youand they stay

hello okay so just another quick littlevideo response to our dear Trisha Paytasokay Trish sweetie darling yesLululemon hates fat people Lululemon area fitness clothing company I don't thinkI can come up with a more motivatingexcuse to lose weight than to fit intofitness clothing or to fit into clothingthat's smaller that looks good okayTrish if someone were to give you a freeoutfit in a size 12 I don't know whatsize you are but in like a Lululemon ora really nice design a piece of clothingthat was too small for you would you agive it away be denied the gift or seework your butt off so that you can wearit because you know it's a piece ofclothing that you really like I don'tunderstand how you can't see that havingsmaller sizes is going to be moremotivating for people to get fit andthey are a fitness clothing company theywant people to be exercising eatingright losing not so much losing weightbut fitting into the healthy body massindex range which ends at just about asize 12 okay if you are more than a size12 your body mass index is unhealthilyhigh like and therefore you are not afit person therefore by you know doing alittle bit of logic working here we cankind of ascertain that you're not fittherefore you won't really be interestedin fitness clothing I understand yessometimes the larger women don't want tobe larger anymore but I don't think thatifworking your butt off to to lose weightyou're going to be that offended by acompany that is motivating you to loseweight do you mean like they want you tobe small to fit into their clothing youwant to be small to fit into thatclothing where's where's the problem youboth want you to lose weight okayyou both want you to be less than a size12Lululemon doesn't make anything allowedto the size 12 awesome that means I haveto be a size 12 or smaller to fit intothe clothing so that I look good when Iworkout so I can maintain my size twelveor smaller size how is that illogicalhow is that so hard to see there'snothing more motivating for me or forany other woman that I can think ofthen jeans we call the skinny jeans thefit jeans the little jeans the babyjeans that you keep and they too smallfor you and they're uncomfortable towear for an entire day but you do it sothat you can actually lose that weightand fit into them that is what Lululemonare trying to do they want to be thatcompany that says come on work a littleharder eat a little better you know worka little harder you can fit into a sizetwelve I don't care how big your bonesare your bones will not be a sizefourteen okay when you are a skeletonthere's no way that your skeleton canmaybe give them a size twelve so you canlose enough weight to fit into a sizetwelve or smaller and the reason theywant to be a size twelve or smaller intheir clothing is so that the peoplethat wear them look good in them I'venever seen and please do not take thisas offensive I personally have neverseen a larger woman say size 12 to 20and said damn I want to look like thatneverin fact I look at myself when I amhigher than an Australian size 10 and Igo ah not cool no we're fitting intothose skinny jeans dammit it's justcommon senseokay skinny people or smaller peoplesell clothing and to be honest with youI do not agree with the plus-size marketbecause I think it encourages an obesityepidemic which has gotten worse andaround the same time as having thatplus-sized kind of market you can eitherencourage and allow people to be obeseor you can encourage them to lose weighta fitness company isn't going toencourage you to be obese there justaren't okay so I I don't know why youfind it so hard to see a fitness companyand fitness business idea they want fitpeople wearing my clothing because theywant fit people in the planet or becausethey want fit people wearing theirclothing because nine times out of tenfifty people look better wearingclothing welleveryone looks better in clothing asopposed to naked not really but you getwhat I meanfit people look better in clothing thana lot of people and they want to selltheir clothing so I don't know I don'tknow how that is such a complicatedtheory to understand especially if youare dedicated to the idea of losingweight you gotta have a reason to loseweight to fit into clothing that looksgood or you know I know there are otherreasons but that is a very goodmotivation I'm not gonna lie so that isa very obvious reason why Lululemon hatefat people and I totally agree with them,26,UCZB32syI0FFtThd6xkPTRrg,HealthNut Nutrition,31,1,0,57,"['healthy', 'clean', 'eating',

hi everyone welcome back to health netnutrition my name is Nikki and today I'mgoing to be sharing with you guys myNovember favorites now I can't believeNovember has already come and gone andit is now December it's crazy christmasis just around the corner member is oneof my favorite months and as you can seebehind me my christmas tree is up andready and i instagramed these little umlet me see if I grab them and iinstagramed these little acorn orderchristmas ornaments and how cute arethey so cute i just thought they'rereally appropriate for health nutnutrition so pop that right back onthere and so those are just scatteredthroughout the tree i got them at homedepot i believe i think there were themartha stewart collection so if you wantsome acorns on your christmas tree whichI don't know if you do you get them athome depot so let's get right on to myNovember favorites so I'm going to startoff with some body favorites I've reallybeen loving this every day coconut bodylotion and i believe the company is justcalled every day because they have acoconut one i believe they have sheabutter one they have a couple differentones but i really like it um it says fornormal to dry skin but I feel like oilyskin is good for this too I have olive askin so my skin tends to be more oilyand I really like this body lotionbecause it doesn't feel greasy on it isalmost watery I would say but it justmelts right into my skin and I reallylike it so it's definitely a greatoption to have if you don't likemoisturizers that make your skin youknow to moisturize door to oily afteryou apply it this is a really greatoption and it doesn't really have muchof a smell to it no it's a really cleansmell so if you're not someone who likesa lot of fragrance this is a good optionso yeah I just would've been reallyliking this product for moisturizing mybody this next product is by dr.bronner's and it is a pure castile soapmade with organic oils andthe rose scented one and i really lovedr. bronner's soaps they're sosupernatural super clean um and you canpretty much use them for anything youcan use them to brush your teeth you canuse them for your laundry use them foryour just walk dishwasher hand soapcleanse your body like I use it uses fora body wash and I love it you can alsouse this as a shampoo I haven't triedthat I mean there's tons of uses for itand this one smells so good let me justyeah if you love rose scented stuff youwill love this body wash so or whateveryou want it to be and yeah I just dumb Ionly fine I find that you just need alittle bit and unlike most natural soapsthat don't lather up because they don'thave sulfates this one lathers up so itdoesn't lather up for a long time whenyou're using it as a body wash butdefinitely loud there's up and I'vereally been liking it as a body wash sodefinitely check out dr. bronner so thisnext item is actually a clothing itemand this is my I believe it's called nolimits I tank top by Lululemon andthat's the back so it's kind of has alittle sports bra underneath and it hasa loose tank top underneath and there'skind of like a band on the bottom sorrythat's a little wrinkly I just pulled itout from the wash and yeah I just reallylove it lululemon is a Canadian companyif you don't know and someone asked meon one of my videos if I'm Canadian yesI'm Canadian and I love Canadianproducts like Lululemon so I just findthat Lululemon's stuff is just madereally well and pretty much everything Ihave from there has lasted me a reallylong time even after washing it um ijust find it doesn't pill it doesn'tlook worn out or faded and yeah it's alittle bit more pricey but i really liketheir quality and i think you really doget what you pay for with Lululemon sothis is just a pink top i've been lovingi think i wore in my mic stress remediesvideo i think i wore in that one i wasdoing a little bit of yoga in it and ijust find it's really great for yogabecause it has a tighter band at thebottom it doesn't just fear it indownward dog position it doesn't rolllike past your head or whatever if youif you wear loose tank thompson do yogayou know what I mean so really been lovethat tanked up for yoga and since I'vebeen doing a lot of yoga lately I'vereally loved it during the month ofNovember this next product is a bookthat I've really been loving and this isthe tapping solution by nick ortner Ithink you say it um now I just startedreading this but I have looked at theirwebsite and watched a few of the videoYouTube videos that Nick and his I thinkit's a sister Jessica happen in and I'lllink some of it below now i'm not thebest to explain what tapping is prettymuch tapping is on similar toacupuncture they're using meridianpoints to believe you say it um such asyou have a couple of meridian pointssort your face throughout your body I'mthe whole point of tapping is to tap onthose meridian points while saying onpositive affirmations to yourself so itcan relieve stress it can get you overif you had like a fight with your bestfriend last night you can tap on it so Iknow it sounds a little weird i'mprobably not explaining it right butwatch i'll put down in the descriptionbox a video explaining what tapping isand that is what led me to buy this bookso even though i'm just started readingthis book the whole tapping concept hasbeen a favorite of mine in the month ofNovember because it's just really helpedme destress and there's actualscientific proof that tapping works soit actually does um calm the body andit's like you're talking to her selfconscious mind if that makes any sense Imean for some it may seem go right pasther head and they you know are not intothat kind of stuff but if you are intothat you know alternative ways torelieve stress and just get over certainthings in your life then reading thetapping solution or just incorporatingsome tapping techniques into your dailyroutine is really beneficial and I'vereally been liking it I've alreadynoticed some benefits from it so yes Iwill link the website and some YouTubevideos below so you can kind ofunderstand a little bit more of what thetapping solution means so hopefully Iexplained that right I don't know solet's get on to the fun stuff whichwould be food the food's I've beenloving for the monthNovember has been this almond eggnog onthis one is by Earth's own and it's justthe almond fresh snow well not reallybeen liking this one on you can have itcold you can heat it up on the stove ifyou can add a little bit of rum if you'dlike I like to just kind of heat it upand add some fresh ground nutmeg to itand it's really delicious and my sistershave been really liking it my mom's beenliking it and yeah it's just been areally good option to have and it says ahundred calories per portion butregardless it's just a good treat tohave during the holidays especially ifyou're someone who doesn't drink milkyou can also find soy milk alternativesfor eggnog but I try not to drink toomuch soy or soy products so I reallylike that they came out with an almondmilk version so definitely been lovingthis one and should check it out so thisitem is a little bit boring but it'sjust something I've been gravitatingtowards in my purse and they are justsome raw almonds and i really like justhaving something always on hand in mypurse just you know i get really lowblood sugar a lot of the times and if Idon't have something to eat I feel likethat thing T feeling and it's not goodso I have to eat I know it's crazy Ihave to eat like every two hours um andhaving some nuts is really a greatoption for me if either i have a net barit really liked like kind bars butsometimes it just like plain old almondsthese are really great and sometimesI'll mix some dates and almonds in alittle ziplock bag and just have them onthe go with me so I can eat them anytimewhen I'm feeling a little bit I'm hungryso those have been a really good optionthe next food I've really been lovingand believe they're in season right nowand that's why you're seeing them pop upeverywhere are carissa mins okay so Igot this from costco and you get nine ofthem and they are so delicious so thisis kind of like what they look like theykind of look like tomatoes / minipumpkins I don't know but you only wantto eat them when they're super soft likeyou if you can feel any firmness in themdon't eat them because they will I don'tknow they're starchy I guess and theywill dry out your mouth it is awful butif you wait for them to be really reallyreally soft oh they are soright there probably one of my favoritefall winter boots oh my goodness youwill I hope you like them as much as Ido if you like for Christmas because nota lot of people know what they arecomment below I'm sure you'll share thesame love that I have for them and yeahI just got these at costco you want tobuy a lot of them because they take awhile to ripen and once they get rightyou will eat wine and want anymore ifyou don't have any other one's ripeyou'll be sad so you know won't be sadjoin Christmas right so get yourself alot of persimmons and yeah so just afood I've really been loving and it'sjust a really good treat to have I'm fordessert or just as a little midday snackso try some persimmons out if you canfind them at your grocery store thisnext product are just some buckwheatwild berry waffles these are by nature'spath and they're so delicious I recentlyposted a Instagram picture of mybreakfast and I had some almond buttersome Saskatoon berry jam um anjo somehemp seeds and sunflower seeds on topwith banana on the side it was sodelicious i also have had these withjust maple syrup right on top a reallygreat treat to have not I wouldn't saythey're the healthiest breakfast tabthey kind of are high in

hey everyone today I'm going to do areview on the Lululemon cropped pantsshorts bottoms that I've tried all theseare in black I hope this is helpful Iget a lot of questions on Lululemon andin real life isn't worth the cost andwhich ones are my favorite in tans downI will continue to spend money onLululemon it's definitely my favoritelike Fitness brand the material iscompletely different than any othermaterial I've tried from like Nike orany other working out brand just it'slike an everlasting material for me I'vehad these pants some of them for fiveyears three years I've worn themhundreds of times and they still lookand feel amazing so I definitely thinkthey're worth the investment they kindof will also shrink to your body so Ihave lost a few inches over a few yearsthat I've had these and I've worn themby my biggest and I my smallest and theystill look and fit great so I thinkthat's more than you can say with a lotof pants that you'll buy so let's getinto the review okay so these are by farmy favorite crops that Lululemon makesso they are a little bit lower then therunning the crop so they're the perfectwaist height I would say you've got apocket in the front which is awesome forputting your phone or anything it alsotells you what size it is so I havethese in size 8 although I'm closer to asize 6 now but even though mornings fortwo years working out all the time inthem they still fit me really wellconsidering they're too loose I can tella little bit if I pull on them thatthere is a little bit of extra room butyou know looking at me in them I stillfeel like they fit me well so Ilike that they go to this length on myleg keep in mind I'm tall so when theymay go into to lower if you are shorteryou've got the logo up top you can turnsome of these inside out and it's happylogo on the lower particle like sothat's also really great that if youwear them down on one side you can flickthem and they'll be pretty much brandnew the material is really amazing it'svery soft it's unlike any other materialI've ever felt perfect for working outit keeps you feeling pretty cool ithelps kind of hold your body tighterkind of like a compression material soyou do look a little bit more firm thanwearing nothing so that's nicethey feel comfortable they don't go seethroughout all when I do squats oranything I love wearing these for likedays they work amazing I'm running theseI've run the medal just a you knowwasn't born them to the gym they're justthe perfect pants the only downside isthat this material grabs on to the cathair and dust quite easily so youdefinitely need a good lint roller ifyou have Catholic I use so yeah theoriginal crop Caesar about $75 and Iwould say definitely worth theinvestment is velocity for years andthey feel minks so these crops are quiteinteresting so these are kind of theadvanced version of crops so they havequite a high waistband as you can seehere they go down quite far so they godown to here I need keep in mind I'm sixfeet tall so if you are shorter theywill go a little bit lower on their legthese are very interesting material veryvery thin it almost feels like silkyskin when you touch itI wouldn't recommend buying these incold climates like it feels like you'repretty much nakedso not the best but they're good for youno marathon runners or anything likethat I can see how these would reallyhelp to know I overheat your body insummer and everything they really helpyou not feel too warm so they feelreally tight on your body they do wantquite high at the front of the pants youhave two little pockets here so youcould put your keys or anything in thereiPod music whatever you've also got azipper pocket at the back which isreally great so if you want money orkeys or anything you have you knowstorage space on your waist which isgreat if you're a runner also when youuse like liquid packs keep going thesefront pockets would be really convenientfor that you've also got some kind ofnetting around the leg so they're veryinteresting they're not my favoritethough they don't go like see-throughwhen you do squats or anything but Iprefer now it's very little too oftenlikes the gym or anything so not myfavorite but they are really goodthey're about a hundred dollars whereasthere are other crops are closer toabout seventy Susan's are more forrunners and I can definitely see it so Ihave three pairs of their gulamanfull-length pants and these are thelongest yoga pants I've ever foundbecause I'm six feet tall I do needsomething like TNA pants would only goup to you about here on me so Google 11actually get they haven't even tallerthan I amand then they will hem it for free whenyou pay you know the hundreds of hoursfor the pants then you come back andpick them up and they're the perfectlife for you she's pretty amazing sothese areand I can see the logo up top these onesare a little bit higher my waist thanthe other two pairs that I have yeah Ireally like it you've got a pocket uptop here where you can once again putyour keys or anything they need andthese are reversible these holes arejust pewter blocks some of the otherpants I have like a white band or youcan get color bands and everything buthonestly this is the best material I'veever tried the most comfortable pants myfirst pair of had for five years and itstill looks great I still wear it allthe time so I definitely recommend thesethey do feel like they kind of lift andpull your body it just feels reallycomfortable to wear the best materialyou can wear these to work I would sayin most jobs running black pants greatfor working out great for every daydefinitely worth the investment to get afew pairs of these pants okay so theseare their black running shorts and Ireally really love these they've gotreally nice material once again veryvery light and flowy so it kind offollows the curve of your leg they comeup and it's a perfect height on yourhips you had on two small pockets in thefront here and a zip up pop it in theback so just like the other runningcrops same kind of pockets andeverythingthere it is ventilation throughout allthe way around so you definitely feelvery very airy and it's actually commonwith a built in kind of bathing suitunderneath kind of underwear so ifyou're running and stuff you don't haveto worry that you'll be revealing toomuch of your distractions or whatever itfeels really comfortable I think theysent really well on the body and reallyreally good comfortableshorts oh these I got when I used to docheerleading so they're really nice theydo kind of support your butt they're alittle short so not everyone's taste butthey were perfect for cheerleadingyou've got the logo on the side thesedon't have any pockets to them but youdo have this kind of nice elastic on topwhich you can actually fold down andhave it kind of stay like that or if youwant it a little higher a little bitmore coverage you can definitely raiseit up so these are good for into mayberunning or just any kind of fitness andyou do want something quite short theseare very comfortable and good coverageunlike some other workout pants I wouldfeel comfortable squatting andeverything without

hey everyone today I'm going to do areview on the Lululemon cropped pantsshorts bottoms that I've tried all theseare in black I hope this is helpful Iget a lot of questions on Lululemon andin real life isn't worth the cost andwhich ones are my favorite in tans downI will continue to spend money onLululemon it's definitely my favoritelike Fitness brand the material iscompletely different than any othermaterial I've tried from like Nike orany other working out brand just it'slike an everlasting material for me I'vehad these pants some of them for fiveyears three years I've worn themhundreds of times and they still lookand feel amazing so I definitely thinkthey're worth the investment they kindof will also shrink to your body so Ihave lost a few inches over a few yearsthat I've had these and I've worn themby my biggest and I my smallest and theystill look and fit great so I thinkthat's more than you can say with a lotof pants that you'll buy so let's getinto the review okay so these are by farmy favorite crops that Lululemon makesso they are a little bit lower then therunning the crop so they're the perfectwaist height I would say you've got apocket in the front which is awesome forputting your phone or anything it alsotells you what size it is so I havethese in size 8 although I'm closer to asize 6 now but even though mornings fortwo years working out all the time inthem they still fit me really wellconsidering they're too loose I can tella little bit if I pull on them thatthere is a little bit of extra room butyou know looking at me in them I stillfeel like they fit me well so Ilike that they go to this length on myleg keep in mind I'm tall so when theymay go into to lower if you are shorteryou've got the logo up top you can turnsome of these inside out and it's happylogo on the lower particle like sothat's also really great that if youwear them down on one side you can flickthem and they'll be pretty much brandnew the material is really amazing it'svery soft it's unlike any other materialI've ever felt perfect for working outit keeps you feeling pretty cool ithelps kind of hold your body tighterkind of like a compression material soyou do look a little bit more firm thanwearing nothing so that's nicethey feel comfortable they don't go seethroughout all when I do squats oranything I love wearing these for likedays they work amazing I'm running theseI've run the medal just a you knowwasn't born them to the gym they're justthe perfect pants the only downside isthat this material grabs on to the cathair and dust quite easily so youdefinitely need a good lint roller ifyou have Catholic I use so yeah theoriginal crop Caesar about $75 and Iwould say definitely worth theinvestment is velocity for years andthey feel minks so these crops are quiteinteresting so these are kind of theadvanced version of crops so they havequite a high waistband as you can seehere they go down quite far so they godown to here I need keep in mind I'm sixfeet tall so if you are shorter theywill go a little bit lower on their legthese are very interesting material veryvery thin it almost feels like silkyskin when you touch itI wouldn't recommend buying these incold climates like it feels like you'repretty much nakedso not the best but they're good for youno marathon runners or anything likethat I can see how these would reallyhelp to know I overheat your body insummer and everything they really helpyou not feel too warm so they feelreally tight on your body they do wantquite high at the front of the pants youhave two little pockets here so youcould put your keys or anything in thereiPod music whatever you've also got azipper pocket at the back which isreally great so if you want money orkeys or anything you have you knowstorage space on your waist which isgreat if you're a runner also when youuse like liquid packs keep going thesefront pockets would be really convenientfor that you've also got some kind ofnetting around the leg so they're veryinteresting they're not my favoritethough they don't go like see-throughwhen you do squats or anything but Iprefer now it's very little too oftenlikes the gym or anything so not myfavorite but they are really goodthey're about a hundred dollars whereasthere are other crops are closer toabout seventy Susan's are more forrunners and I can definitely see it so Ihave three pairs of their gulamanfull-length pants and these are thelongest yoga pants I've ever foundbecause I'm six feet tall I do needsomething like TNA pants would only goup to you about here on me so Google 11actually get they haven't even tallerthan I amand then they will hem it for free whenyou pay you know the hundreds of hoursfor the pants then you come back andpick them up and they're the perfectlife for you she's pretty amazing sothese areand I can see the logo up top these onesare a little bit higher my waist thanthe other two pairs that I have yeah Ireally like it you've got a pocket uptop here where you can once again putyour keys or anything they need andthese are reversible these holes arejust pewter blocks some of the otherpants I have like a white band or youcan get color bands and everything buthonestly this is the best material I'veever tried the most comfortable pants myfirst pair of had for five years and itstill looks great I still wear it allthe time so I definitely recommend thesethey do feel like they kind of lift andpull your body it just feels reallycomfortable to wear the best materialyou can wear these to work I would sayin most jobs running black pants greatfor working out great for every daydefinitely worth the investment to get afew pairs of these pants okay so theseare their black running shorts and Ireally really love these they've gotreally nice material once again veryvery light and flowy so it kind offollows the curve of your leg they comeup and it's a perfect height on yourhips you had on two small pockets in thefront here and a zip up pop it in theback so just like the other runningcrops same kind of pockets andeverythingthere it is ventilation throughout allthe way around so you definitely feelvery very airy and it's actually commonwith a built in kind of bathing suitunderneath kind of underwear so ifyou're running and stuff you don't haveto worry that you'll be revealing toomuch of your distractions or whatever itfeels really comfortable I think theysent really well on the body and reallyreally good comfortableshorts oh these I got when I used to docheerleading so they're really nice theydo kind of support your butt they're alittle short so not everyone's taste butthey were perfect for cheerleadingyou've got the logo on the side thesedon't have any pockets to them but youdo have this kind of nice elastic on topwhich you can actually fold down andhave it kind of stay like that or if youwant it a little higher a little bitmore coverage you can definitely raiseit up so these are good for into mayberunning or just any kind of fitness andyou do want something quite short theseare very comfortable and good coverageunlike some other workout pants I wouldfeel comfortable squatting andeverything without anything showing so Ireally do alright so that was my reviewI hope you found this helpful let meknow if you have any questions oranything down below thank you so muchfor watching and have a great

tuned to all my newvideos dropping weeklyso this is the cross chill jacket it'sin the color hazy jadein a size 14. i'm typically a size 12 inlululemon jackets but i actually had tosize up in this onei did try on the 12 and the 14 and the12 was just toosnug fitting for this jacket i find itvery slim fittingthroughout the body and the arms areactually kind of the armpit area isvery slim fitted when you do get it trueto size so i would definitely recommendsizing up one in this another benefit ofdoing sois that you are able to layercomfortably and it because it is a slimfitting jacket it's equally asflattering when you do go one size upso now i'm gonna unzip it and let youguys see what it looks like on theinsideokay so this is what it looks likeunzippedand it does have a fleece material onthe inside umlining it to help keep you warm and thisjacket is made forrunning and i use it for running andwalking um in the winter and in the latefall just because it keeps me warmso i wouldn't really recommend this justfor kind of a walking around jacketbecause it doesn't really have the typeof insulation for thatso it does have this here to help youknow hang up your coat with a hangerit has a little pocket here for yourheadphones it goes straight on throughso you can put your headphones there sothey won't be bumping around whileyou're runningthis does not have any inside pocketsjust on the outsideand in terms of the hood it does havesome of the cinches at the side here sothere's one on this sideand there's another on the other sidejust to help youmake sure that it's staying tight onyour head while you are out there so itdoesn't blow off in the windso this is what it looks like from theback i'm just gonna zoom in a littlecloserso it does have a logo right here on thewristand it also has right here a pocket foryour watches so you can just unzip thatso you can easily checkyour heart rate or whatever you need tocheck on your watch while you're beingactive and on the goand it also has another cinch right hereat the back of the hood just to help youkeep that hood on securelyin terms of pockets this does have threepocketson the back so it has two pockets on thesideand it has one right here this isactually on the backand this pocket is very largei'm going to go ahead and put somethingin there just to kind of show you guysthe size andsee what it can hold so i just wanted tosay any of these pockets could easilyhold a smartphone whether it be like xlversionor a smaller version um whatever it maybeso i have a standard 500 milliliterwater bottle i'm going to show you guysyou know that it can easily fit in thispocketand there it is the pocket kind of runsfrom here to hereso this jacket is excellent for runningand for going out on walks or hikingbecause you can hold a lot of items intherewhether you need to carry you know keyssnacks water your phonewhatever else you need this jacket isgoing to hold it all it's also windproofand it is umpretty warm it has a light insulationbut if you're kind of moving it on thego it would be enough for thatso now i'm going to go ahead and put iton and show you guys what it looks likeonso this is what it looks like on meand it does have a logo on this sideand this is the watch hole so my watchis kind of right there peeking outand you can easily check that whenyou're using itand the sleeves are definitely long sothis is what the crosstalk jacket lookslike in natural lightingso i'm just going to turn on the flashand show you guys what the reflectivitylooks likebecause i know a lot of us out there aregoing to be using this going for runsin the early morning or at night so itis nice that we do have all thesereflectivityareas on this jacket and here it is fromthe back there is that nicelong reflectivity going right across theback there so you definitelyare lit up when you do go out earlymorning and i just wanted to mentionthatin the camera it looks kind of like avery pale umalmost whitish color but it is a verybright umkind of light teal it's just not pickingup that well in this lightingbut when i did try it on um seeing ittherethat is a more accurate representationof the color of the jacket just so youguys know thatokay so i'm just going to show you guysthe tag up close in case anybody wantsthat informationand the crosstalk jacket did retail for198 canadian plus tax and i believe it'sthe sameprice in americanokay so i'm just gonna pour some wateron it just to show you guys thewaterproofing on this jacketand i do want to mention that it washesamazinglyi've had this thing for about six monthsnow and i've washed it at least10-12 times and it's just amazing it'sholding up there's no fraying orkind of pilling or anything i know somepeople experience pillingthey experience kind of stitching comingundone but for me i haven't had any ofthose issuesum this jacket is absolutely great forrunning and for walking and being activeinso here is the water bottle i'm justgoing to quickly pour some on hereokay so the water just immediately beadsupand if i tip it it rolls offso once again this is completelywaterproof it's windproof as welli believe this is their only jacket thatis windproof so that's one benefit ifit's a really windy day you might wantto grab thisover grabbing another type of jacketthat they have for winter runningall right guys so i did want to mentionthat it's not actually 100 waterproofit is 100 waterproof um on this materialbut underthe arms kind of on the side here it isjust water resistantsorry about that i've been stuck in therain ice rainand it's definitely good enough for thatand my cat really wants to be in thisvideo right nowso i did want to let you guys know thatconsidering the price the colorthe quality um the performance ofit function of the jacket um the fitand everything like that i would goahead and give this a 9.2 out of 10.it is a great jacket especially for myuses which are primarily renterwalking and running and i also use it inthe late fall when it's coldi definitely do find myself going forthis jacket a lot more than othersbecause it is windproofwhich is huge there are a lot of timeswhen it's super windy and it gets reallycoldbut the benefit of this jacket is thatyou can always layerand i do want to mention that forjackets i'm primarily a 10 or a 12 butfor this i actually did go up to a 14.the cross chill jacket definitely doesfit tight four jackets i definitelyalways want to size up one or two justto make sure i am able to layerbecause for winter jackets and winterrunning and walking that's reallyimportant so you can make sure thatyou're staying warmand if you guys are interested inpurchasing the crosstalk jacket i'mgoing to go ahead and drop a link in thedescription below for you to usebut i do want to say this hazy jadecolor is a little bit olderi did get it in 2020 um in octoberso it's no longer available on thewebsite but they do have new colorsdropping all the time on lululemonon their website in the crosstalk jacketso i'm going to go ahead and post thelinkfor you know the current colors that areavailable for you guys if you areinterested in getting this jacketokay so i know i've said a couple timesthat this jacket is excellent forrunning and that's what i do use it forum so just for kind of generally usingit for running hiking walking i woulddefinitely give it a thumbs upit's fantastic for that if you arelooking for an everyday jacket just towear around the winterthis is definitely not going to cut itin canadian winters it doesn't haveenough insulation for thatbut they do have other jackets that arebetter suited for that type ofactivities so that's all i have fortoday thanks for watchingand make sure to like comment andsubscribe

hey guys it's me again and I am heretoday with a workout fitness clothinghaul for you guys I totally was evenplanning on doing this video but I justhad so much fitness stuff I've beenaddicted to buying workout clothes sincemy last haul so I thought why not shareit with you guys and try it on this issomething guys might be interested inlike I have a whole huge bag like that alot of its from Lululemon which Iactually never been to before but I haveother stuff as well so exciting videoand also side note this is probably thefirst time on camera that I have everworn my hair in a ponytail so don't mindthis dead animal behind my head this isactually I'm omegle hair and noextensions no perm no nothing and it isso hot and humid out right now it's justbeen blow-dried that's a bit frizzy so Iput it up because I don't want it on myneck sweating okay so let's just goahead and pull stuff out it is soweird-looking myself in the viewfinder Ifeel like I look old with like no hairoh it's so weird anyway the first thingI picked up as a new tank top I kind ofrealized after combing that hole that Imainly got pants and I definitely needednew tops for working out in so I pickedup this here this is by added an oradidas however you want to call itsomeone clothing hold is the most weirdthing ever but it is basically great andit's got this neon and orange trim andit has to add an S logo here I mean it'sjust pretty basic but I love it it'ssomething that I can wear with a lot ofmy stuff because I have like a lot oforange gym clothes or pink so it justmatches really really easily it's just atank top how long can we talk about itfor I also picked up another tank fellfrom had a nap this one is cool this oneis purple again but you guys know I weara lot of like purple and pink gymclothes duh this is just purple and itis made out of mesh material so it is alittle bit see-through but nothing toomajor like you're not going to beshowing your whole bra and the back ofthis one is pretty cool it's a Razorbackbut it has this neck cutout here so youcan wear kind of a cute bra behind itthis one they will say isn't I don'tthink any of that kind of sweat wickingmaterial or it might be but I do noticethat it is more form-fitting so when yousweat it's kind of mesh dogs kind ofstick to you so it's not as cool feelingas I would like but it is really cute Ijust don't work on like they usuallybecause that is when I sweat like abeastthese next two purchases are prettyfunny because if you guys watched mylast clothing haul it will be linkedbelow you may remember I bought a pairof underwear like compression type shortshorts and I was like you're not goingto wear them climb at my goal weightblah blah blah anyway I warnedthem because it is starting to get hotand I was sweating an audio Toyota and Iwas like these short are the mostcomfortable thing to work out in in mylife if I guess up these ones here theseones are really cool they kind of havelike this waterfall another water splashpattern there blue was like lighter bluethrough them just a regular three inchcompression short the Under Armor onesdon't write up for me that's why I likethem all so they're kind of a thickercompression material so they're notsee-through either so they just stayplace the waistband I will say is alittle big on them but everywhere elsethey fit me perfectly and they are asize small and then I also got theseones here these are black and then theyhave a purple waistband and purple andcoral stripes down the side you guysknow you're a little purple and orangeto the gym so district 6 perfectly andyeah well more can I say I got some newshort I love them so much I do highlyrecommend you guys check the UnderArmour compression shorts out I knoweveryone's all about the Nike pros but Ireally prefer the Under Armour onesespecially if you have five like I dookay moving on I've been obsessedobsessed obsessed with half sip sweaterso our main contact I came out parkourthere but I've been so obsessed so Ipicked up a few of them this first onehere is from Nike and bright magenta theside leg office in is an extra smallbecause I do like them to be fitted Iactually wear workout clothes like thesekind of things out in the daytime if I'mnot going anywhere important if I'mrunning errands if I'm just going to themall I don't dress out on a day-to-daybasis so this is actually something thatI bought to wear in regular life andthat I've been wearing so I love it Idefinitely want to get it fitted becauseI think if you get them fitted they looknicer for every day it kind of looks alittle bit more put together and likeyou made an effort so this is reallycute it's something I want to get in abunch more colors but right now theother colors they have are ugly and thisis really nice as color because I boughta pair of Nike Free Run sneakers I wasgoing to show you but I didn't wearingthem and I'm not going to bring wornshoes upstairs in the house it's a bigno-no for me but they are the exact samecolor so it looks perfect togethercontinuing on with my half sip obsessionthey got two more and actually twooutfits from Under Armour so two of themare kind of the same thing again is justspandexit's coral it's bright orange and coralsit's going to really mess up my lightingbut since these are high light color soit's probably going to look washed outthese are really nice these are a littlebit thicker than the Nike one they havekind of am not fleece lining but a lineto them whereas the ninety-one is justspandex all over it has the underarm onthe neck your quarters it and on theback have a nice zip pocket with areflective strip and these ones arereally nice too because they have thethumb hole this is actually in a smallbut I'm waiting to exchange it for anextra small because the extra small fitsme better as you'll see in the secondone that I call but they're just all outand so I'll wear the small if I have tobut I got that and then to go with it Igot these pants again these outfits areto wear outside and regular life likewhen I'm running errands and stuff theseare they're fly by running legging andthey're just gray leggings basic greyleggings but on the back they have thecoral stripe and mesh and then the UnderArmour is also in the same coral colorso in these leggings I wear a size smalland they're great because they'recompression so it makes your butt lookgood they make your size but these arejust a really nice fit I love the UnderArmour stuff and so I went back and Iended up getting a nother color so I gotthese zip the same exact sweater in neonyellow yes I can see my light is crazybut believe me this is highlighteryellow the exact same thing and this isactually an extra small so you'll see inthe triumph portion that I definitelylike the way this one fits betterbecause I don't really have any boobs soI like them to be a little bit morefitted so they can show off my shape andmake me look a little bit more feminineas opposed to boxy it's just my personalpreference and then I go the pair ofthese are their fly by crop so they arethe same thing the Lighting's were justa full length and these are just a croppants and they're basically grey andthen they have the mesh in thelime-green as well as the lime greenaccents on the back so I love these twosets can't wait to start wearing themjust so put on the floor greatand then lastly from Under Armour I gotanother pair of their underwear I spokeabout this in my last haul a lot ofthese pants show panty lines and I'm nota farm girl as I said many times beforeso this underwear is great they're 330but I'm sure you can probably get themsomewhere else cheaper but if I'm atUnder Armour I'll usually pick up a pairso I just got myself a black pairthey're neither that kind of Brazilianbutt underwear and basically they'reseamless so they really don't show underpink workout pants especially if they'relight or tie any see-through pants Iwear these and they're completelyinvisible so they're comfortable but youalso can't see them so I do highly highhighly recommend and then everything outin the zag which is still pretty fullthey go to ton of stuff fromLululemon I broke my Lululemon virginityI have never shopped at Lululemon beforeI know it's kind of a craze and for mostgirls and I honestly thought it was overheight but he's laughs I want to say sixweeks I've been beyond obsessed I can'tget out of there I need to stop goingthere because it's kind of an expensiveaddiction to have but I pick up somereally cute stuff so let me show youguys I picked up this top here this tanktop it is so cute it is called the ifyou're lucky tank top and I got it ingray and I didn't want to get in othercolors but they were all sold out by thetime I realized I loved it likeliterally days later you like know Ilove mesh detailing and interestingdetailing so this has all mesh on thefront but the back on this is superSuperDuper cool it has a really low backit has this mesh back here and then itshows a lot of your bath so it looksreally cute on you'll see in the trialand you can wear one of those reallynice strong tea bras behind it because alot of it will show through so this isreally cute I got a ton of complimentson it it is in a size 2 because I didfind this comes up a little bit big andthen the real reason I actually evenwent it in the first place is becauseI've been seeing disco pants all overInstagram and I want to get my hands onthem and had no idea where it was fromluckily one of my friends told mebecause she had them and so I ran in tothe store to get them these are the HighTimes pants they look so tiny whenthey're off like these look like childpants but they're basically blacklegging and they have all these meshinserts in them it kind of looks likemummy print but again you'll see in thetrial they're really sexy and reallycool they're also a high-rise pants sothese cover my belly button ring theyfit nice and high so when you're liftingthey don't write down because these areluan material they're not shiny materialthey're more of a common pant I did takethese in a size 2 so I love these I getcompliments literally every time I wearthem from trainers at the gym otherpeople they are just really attentiongrabbers so I love them so muchI think the Lululemon mesh stuff issuper cool so anyway then I went aheadand got some sports bras because I wasmore inside medium sports bras so it wasdoing nothing in terms of support and Iknow I did get the most supportivesports bras but I don't I have boobs soI'm a third to B so I didn't need themost support so I got free to view allbras to athe first one is this bright orangecoral colors up on the front it justlooks like your regular sports bra and Ialso a lot of the Lululemon bras andcome with the option of wearing paddingin them because I am superself-conscious about like when I getcold and then your nipples kind of pokesthrough if there's no padding andanything I get so self-conscious aboutthat I don't know I might be weird but Ican't stand that the back of super cuteit has this crisscross design and thenit kind of cuts down and it has a lowback these are they're really nicebecause you can wear them with any kindof low back shirt and this will all showthrough or even with a racerback itshows through just add some interest Idon't find a lot of support for mepersonally as long as I get it fittedenough so I wear these in a 2 or 4whatever they have this one happens tobe a 2 but then I also bought it in deepblack this one's dirty right now Iapologize I've been wearing it and thisone is a size 4 because it is all theyhave but the exact same thing and then Ialso pick up this one here this onestill has the tags on I haven't worn itthis is the free to be bra so it is verysimilar it is the same as the front hasbe free to be wild broad is your regularshelf bra with padding hey goodness andthen the back is just a little bit lessstrappy so I wanted one that didn't haveall the straps because sometimes if youhave a racerback you just want to showlike you're back in your shoulder bladesso this one is still really cute but itshows more of your shoulder blades andthen this one I took in a 4 and it'sthis kind of off-white eggshell kind ofpinkish eggshell color I know for me Ido really like these they are kind ofexpensive but they wash well and a nicenew new sports bras and they were thereand they were cute so sue me so theycame up with some more mesh soft handsand I am obsessed with anything mesh asyou guys know these ones again I gotthem in black but they come in two otherpatterns but patterns though weren'treally for me in a solid deck I likethem in all blackthese ones are these shiny luxe treematerial these are called the what arethese called the hot 2 Street pantsbasically they are black pant as shownso they look like shorts here and thenthe thigh is all mesh on the front youdo have a knee panel so when you'rebending down it's not meshed and then onthe bottom again it's all mesh toohowever I will say in these ones I didtake a four I don't mind you lovinsizing it's totally consistent for me atleast I find in the lot stream pantsthat's a shiny Titor material morespandex and not the cotton blue on Itake a size up so I take a size four inthese which is sign they also picked upthis shirt here to a black shirt I knowso boring I've been wearing this sothere's a deal don't stain whoops my badbut I just want to show you before Ithrew it in the walk it is just thismesh like talk like a mesh tank topbasically in the front but it is over asports bra so this is really coolbecause it has a built-in sports brawith padding again which is optional butthe back you guys know I'm a sucker foranything with a cute back the fact islike a long tee back so it shows a lotof your back this sport sport isdefinitely more supportive than the freeto be walled it's a nice thick of andsports ball so if you have bigger boobsI totally think you would like this tubeand sizing wise for this I took a fourwhich i think is my regular to decide inLululemon the top and then most recentlythis week I picked up this new pair ofpants I wasn't even going to get them Ijust went in to look because all minethe promos even my thing but when Itried them on if they looked so freakinggood I have to get them they are theseright here but they're perfect forspring and summer so it has green andhas blue coral black it has alldifferent colors in it all kind of on awhite base and these are called the HighTimes pants so they're the same thefirst mesh ones I showed youhowever this is a nice stretchy luxetree material so I took these in a fourinstead of a two for the perfect fitthese are so cool on they're so coolthey look really pretty on these areeither kind of a love it or hate itthing for a lot of people they'll be tooloud but for me they're gorgeous theyalso make your butt look so so sofreakin got little pants I don't knowwhat it is but they just make your buttlook so round a night I just love themand then to go with that I ended uptrying it on with this top here I wasn'teven going to get the top I just wantedsomething to try it on with because Iwas wearing a fancy top and I ended upgetting it because it looks so cutetogether if you guys actually follow meon snapchat I posted a snap chat so youguys should follow my snapchat and thisis called their run swiftly Razorbacktonightlightweight tank top it has theLululemon logo kind of in the front butit's not ostentatious or anything likeyou can't really tell and it's just acasual Razorback so this one I ended upgetting in a 6 because my true to size 4was more streamlined to the body so Ifigured if I sweat it kind of thick tome but I think I'm going to go back andexchange it for a 4 because I did end upgoing back and getting it in white aswell and I do think it's structuredown a little bit so this one one hereis the exact same finish the whiteracerback this one I got in a size fourand I think I like the way it's a littlebit better because it does seem likeit's going to give out a little bit andstretch out a little bit once I startwearing it I'm working out in it and theother one was a little bit big in thearmhole so I don't know I might switchit if they have it but if they don'thave my size in this color I will keepit because I don't mind having like onea little bit looser I want a little bittighter it's not a big deal but theseare just basic but that is it well thatis not it because I got my cash a ton ofstuff in my opinion but I just love cutegym clothes they're motivating and I'vebeen going to the gym five times a weekso I need to have providing it just incase I'm a little bit slow my washingthat week I like to have options to wearso I'm just justifying it but I hope youguys enjoyed this video please let meknow what you guys thought in the bottombar below and let me know what style ofa workout video that

hey guys so it was my birthday a littlewhile ago andi did a lot of shopping and got a lot ofgifts butone place i went shopping gave me alittle bit of an idea for this videoi went to lululemon which is a mostlyyoga wearstore although obviously you can wearthe clothes for whatever you wanti tend to wear them for working out andfor dancing although i do sometimes goto yogaanyway it started in vancouver bcin canada where i live so i feel alittle patriotically goodcitizen for shopping at lululemon alsotheir bags are red and white which arenational colorsso i feel like more patriotic i alsohave red lips today which kind ofmatches the bagweird i didn't plan that i'm getting offtopicanyways the idea i got when i wasshopping at lou lemon was to do a minivideo ofshowing how workout clothes do not haveto be boring i only got four things andthey're all black which you're going tosayis still boring but i have so manybrightly colored things from the lemonif you ever go you'll see coloreverywherethat i wanted to get a few more blackthings they're just so versatilethese are just plain black shorts likethisthey're stretchy material they have alittle tie at the topthey're a little bit longer than youraverage booty shorts so you feel morecomfortable if you're at the gymor if you're in a dancer class where youdon't want anything topop out awkwardly and they're just plainblack and have a littlelululemon symbol on the back they'recalledthe knocked out short if my camera willshow thatthe knocked out short and in canada theyare48next i got some adorable leggings theylook like thisthey go just below my knees i'm reallytall i'm 5'10just in case you guys didn't knowanything i've ever mentioned thatactuallyanyway i'm 5 foot 10 so these only go tojust below my knees they may go a littlelonger on you if you'reshorter than me which is probablebecause i'm a giant anywaysthey have cute little ruffles on thesides and on the backthey have an awesome little pocketso you can put a lip gloss or your phoneif it's smalleror whatever you need in your pocketthere also my favorite part of theseis that it has a little symbol on oneleg but on the bottom of each side ithas a little keyhole openingand a little bit of ruching there whichi think is socute so yes they're plain black leggingsbut no they're not boring they're soadorable and they're so comfortablei don't know if i've said this butlululemon clothes are so comfortablethey have like most of them have sweatwickingmaterial which means it takes thewetness away from your body when you'resweatingkeep you dry and cool anyway these arecalled thei don't know how to pronounce that cropand they are 78 in canadanext i got this adorable shirt again inblackit's a little empire waist shirt thatcomes away from the body a little bit asit comes down it's not a bubbleshirt but it does come away from thebody of itit has some pretty detailing at the topthe straps have some ruching on themand it has those seams and then theempire waist seamand some pleats at the front and thenat the back it just has the littlelululemon symboland the straps crossed at the back thisis the belarious tankand it is 58 in canadaand last but definitely not least isthis adorablehalter top i have never seen them have ahalter top like this before they've hadhalter topsthat are just solid material around theback or that attachlike sort of a t strap a halter top witha little strap attaching it to thebottomback at the back you know what i'msayingbut i've never seen them have a tiehalter top andi really love this idea and it has thisreally pretty sort of mesh insertv at the front and then these prettylittleruffles making an empire waist again itcomes away a little bit from the bodylike the other one but it doesn't haveany cleats at the frontnow the back it has that tie around theneckand then it's a lower back than most oftheir shirts which i really like fordanceand has those little ruffled straps fromthe front that wrap around the backwhat i liked about this is it remindedme of a leotard and they used to makedance leotards they don't do dance wearanymorespecifically dance wear althoughobviously you can wear anything thatthey havein a dance class but this just remindedme of their old leotards with the lowback with that strapwhich is why i ended up gravitatingtowards thisas the little lululemon symbol at theback andthis is called thei can pronounce this one the dignityhalterand it is 52 in canadaso yeah those are the things i got alemon for my birthdayand i think you can see even thoughthey're all plain blacknone of them are boring so you can wearthings like thiswhen you're working out or in a danceclass yoga class whateverand not feel boring and not feel likeyou can't be fashionableand plus every item i showed you comesin about a billion colorsthey have brights and more neutralcolors they have black and whitethey have mixed sort of heather colorsversus plain colorsthey have patterns they

some good deals soI'm excited to show you what I got Iwasn't really looking for anything inparticular one thing I did have my eyeon and I was so pleased to have gottenthose but everything else just came fromsites that I bookmark because I knowthey have good sales so as I go alongI will flag the stores which I'm talkingabout just in case you want to do thesame and bookmark those sites for nextyear's sales or even some sales as wellso I hope you guys enjoy and I'm gonnaget stuck right in and show you what Igotso the first few things I got put allsome high street stores so as their NHNam and I paste a big order from Zaraand I wasn't really expecting any of itto work out I just kind of put a load ofthings in my cart and I wanted to seewhat they look like and I returnedanything that I didn't want but I don'tthink I'm returning anything like I lovepretty much everything which is sosurprising I'm so pleased about thefirst thing is this t-shirt if you'vebeen watching my channel for a while youwill know that I lovestriped t-shirts I wear them all thetime I have so many and I thought thiswas just such a cute version it's alittle bit shorter so it looks greatwith the high-waisted jeans but it alsohas this little detail right here and itjust says I heart you on this littleplastic bit and then it has an I likeyour I love you in different languagesjust below so I thought this was so cuteI really really liked it the next thingI got from Zara was just this plainwhite t-shirt and this does have a priceso this was a 10 pounds I feel like I gofor about 6 or something like that andthis is a bit creased I'm afraid but Ithought this is really nice it has kindof a rounded bottom there's a slightlykind of a heavier weight t-shirt so it'snot a thin cotton it's more like a knitit kind of has like a fleecy inside andbecause it's a bit heavier it just hangsreally nicely so I really really likethis one and then the next thing I gotwas this adorable and super soft sweaterit's kind of chunky it's really reallynice to feel it's very soft and it justsays hashtag into the mood I thoughtthis is so fun and it was reallyinexpensiveI got this in a small and the originalprice was $17.99 as I forget how much itwas on sale but I love this I thought itwas very very cutethen I got a black dress and I wasactually walking past the Covent Gardenstore and I saw this and the Malecon asthey had it in the window and it lookedamazing they had it like facing likewith the back facing outwards so you cansee the back the back of this dress isgorgeous it just looks like so I don'tknow whether you're gonna be able to seethat but basically it's kind of it'ssee-through so it has these see-throughpanels and it's just very very sexy butnot in a kind of trashy way it's veryelegant still I think I really like thisso I rushed in to check it out andunfortunately they were all out of smalland I thought of the extra small wouldbe too small so I had to give it a Missand then I found it on sale like a weeklater on the Zara websites I was sopleased it's pretty plain on the frontyou know there's nothing much to I dothink I would belt it to give it a bitmore definition but I think the back isjust such a centerpiece of this so Iabsolutely love this this was 29 poundsand again I forget how much it was onsale but it was a really good price Ithink for such a lovely classic dressthe next thing is a skirt and this wascalled the tube skirt and it's this kindof fake leather effect sketch I'm usenot a fan of this feels pretty real andit's just you know plain straight pencilskirt and then on the back has a littlezipper and then just a slit there soit's easier to walk and I love this Ilove the fact that it's Navy as opposedto black so it makes it a little bitdifferent I think it goes really reallywell with the striped t-shirt I boughtas well so I love that I thought it waskind of cool and edgy and this was$17.99 these prices are seeming verycheap to me so I do wonder if these arethe sale prices but as I said I willlink why can't blow I got this in a sizesmall and the final thing I got fromZara were these pair of shoes Iabsolutely love these these are justkind of pointy leopard print flats withthe lace up detail here obviously theseare knock-offsof the aquaszero shoes but those are soexpenses I thought these were a nicecheap alternative I wasn't expectingthese to become too poor and they reallyare so just a complete win I think it'sa plain black saw and I think these arejust nice to kind of dress uphow jean so love these and the nextthing I got was some peach now thiswasn't in the sale I did get a few saleitems but I think I returned them allbecause they just didn't really work outI love this I thought it was a reallygood deal so I wanted to show you guysand it's this kind of work dress that Ibought at what you can you don't have towear you wear anywhere but that's whatI'm interning and wearing it and it'sthis nice kind of an slinky material soit's very very flattering and it justhas a v-neck with this banding fordefinition and then it's just a pencilskirt and it's just kind of plain on theback and it's just so flattering it fitsreally really nicely and it looks waymore expensive than it was it was Ohdoesn't have the price but this was anun size small and hopefully this willstill be in stock so I will link it butI love this I thought it was just sochic and elegant and looked amazing onthe model on the HTM website which iswhy I tried it and it's equally asimpressive in person so I was so pleasedto have found this so the next fewthings are from Lululemon and I know Ijust did a very big Lea lemon haul butthey did a very big sale I think it wason Christmas Eve and they put a ton ofstuff on there we made too much sectionand always a really good discount Ithought so I couldn't resist picking upa few more things I do try and postabout saleswhenever I see good ones especially onesthat I'm shopping on my blog so I willlink my blog down below so if you checkthat regularly then you will hopefullybe on top of these cells as much as I amso the first thing I got was this hatand I'm not a huge hat person I have afew but I am going to be doing that gymwith my boyfriend lately my boyfriend'smaking me join the gym in January and Ithought that a hat would come useful forpost gym hair and I really liked thisone it has it looks like it's plainblack but it has a kind of reflectivesurface right here which is showing upkind of silvery but it's also just adark grey so I thought this is very coolthis is the boar hat so I loved that andthen the next thing I got I had seenthese when they first uploaded and theywere ridiculously expensive so they were138 pounds which I just wouldn't havepay for leggings like that's insanethen they went for either half off orless than that so a really good price Iwas a bit nervous because they had thiskind of sequined detailing and these arethe tightstights and I wasn't sure whether thiswas just a very impractical purchase andthat the sequence would get caught andeverything but I decided to give them goon it so please I did because this isactually a print these aren't actuallysequins and I love them because they arereflective I thought they were so cuteand then they have this kind ofscalloped detailing on the bottom aswell so I thought these were gorgeousthey fit really well they are definitelytight but just really kind of fun onesomething a bit different and I sopleased to have often there were such abig discount the next thing I got is arepeat purchase I love this so much whenI bought it I actually featured theminty green one in my Lululemon haulbefore and because it worked out so wellI decided to get this one as wellunfortunately that one did go on sale Idid post about that on my blog as wellbut that was like cakes I managed doesthat snap this one up as well and theseare 62 pounds for price I forget howmuch the sell price was but I got affairthat off so I was pleased to have gottenthis and then I got another pair of HighTimes pants because I love the ones thatI got before so much and these are justthe long ones and these are 82 usuallybut I think I got almost half off theseso they are very bright but I love thefit so I thought these might make a nicechangenext up awesome goodies I got from theSpace NK sale and Space NK is always oneof those shots where I always make it apoint to check out their sales because Ialways find they're really good so it isdefinitely worth signing up for theirawards program because I think rewardscards members get first access to theirsales it always send an email out andyou have to be quick you have to clickpretty much immediately because all thegood stuff goes really really fast andthey always discount a lot of their giftsets to a half price which meanssometimes you get a whole gift set forless than the price of one of theproducts within that gifts that soreally good savings to be had and thisyear I got the Smith and Colt diary of abeauty junkie trio set I've not triedthese nail polishes yet I've beenwanting to and I got this whole set Ithink for 18 pounds which i think isless than one of the nail polishes it'sit was a really really good price Ithink it was 18 anywhere maybe more thanthat but I will list details if it'sstill available and I thought these aregorgeous you have really nice red colora gold glitter and a deeper red soperfect for the festive season whichobviously is now passed but I'm sure Istill get lots of useand the next thing I got was from LauraMercier and this is the mini lipglosscollection in soft pinks and they arejust lots of little mini lip glosses itjust really kind of wearable nice softshades in this really pretty packagingwith all these little illustrations Ilove this I also got this for half offif you can sign up to their rewardsprogram I would definitely recommend itI think what you get is you accumulatepoints then it turns into five poundbatches and then first access to salesas well the next thing I got was fromHarrods and Harris's another one thosesales I would really recommend checkingout I would recommend signing up to be arewards card before you do get I thinkyou accumulate points as well but you doget access to their 10% off sales whichthey do sporadically throughout the yearbut you also get first look at theirfull name sales which are definitelyworth checking out I find that thediscounts are always very very generousand you tend to get first looking and Igot a pair of Valentino rock stars I didreveal these on my Instagram andfollowing me there you already know whatthese look likebut you just have the dust bag sothey're just really pretty turnedbubblegum suits that are the sweetest ohand this is in the nappa leather as wellso just a really nice shade of pink withthis beautiful gold detailing rightthere and i obsessed these I haven'tworn them out yet but they seem prettycomfy from walking around the flat I doyou think they'll stretch out a bit aswell because they are the nappa leatheras opposed to patent so I think thisleather is a bit more malleable so Iabsolutely love these I got these for318 and I think I'm about 1/3 off so Igot a fairly good deal on them I thinkand I just think these are super supercute next up is another pair of shoesand these are v GN veto Roxy if that'show you say it plexi pumps I've had myeye on these for so long and I knew Iwanted to get a parents winter I did buyanother pair of these from self cheersand self kids is another sale to lookout for because they're always reallygood but I got those in a larger sizeand then I shopped the far-fetched saleagain another really great one and Ifound these and I prefer these I'm goingto return those ones that actuallyclicking click so I just have to kind ofgo there pick them up and then return atthe same time that these ones I loveand the Farfetch'd aisle was amazingthat always really good for designershoes I would sign up to their mailinglist if you can and these were actuallyan extra 20% off which they do fairlyfrequently as well so you can snap upsome real bargains and you just have thedust bag like so and they look like itwas there and so I got these in the darkgray suede on the bottom and then theblack heel on the back and then theyhave the plastic bit right here I gotthese in a size 38 and a half which arethe same as my Valentino ones as welland these fit absolutely fine and I justthought these was such a good deal I gotthese for I think half off in the end soa really really good one and Iabsolutely love these they are quitehigh but they're just so so stunning Ireally just think these are so chic andthey're gonna go so many things I can'twait to wear these the last thing I gotwas from the Gucci seller and it is ahandbag I didn't realize that Gucci didonline sales but I knew they had anonline store so I was kind ofperiodically checking on the off-chanceand in the hope that they had a salebecause I did have my eye on somethingand they did want to house I was reallypleased so it comes in this and thatgorgeous box I had lovely gift packagingwith ribbons and stuff goodness that'sunfortunately items torn off so I can'tshow you it but inside you just have therather massive dust bag inside here isanother tote tote crazy at the momentclearly and is the Gucci swing toy whichi think is totally gorgeous I got it inthis purpley pink color really nice ithas a dark blue inner and this went onsale in three colors so there was abright fuchsia pink color this color andthen at an all-over navy blue as wellthat one sort out really quickly andthen this one this one was live for abit long a bit I think it did and thenshe fell out I think that the fuchsiaone is still available but I didn't wantanother blue or blue tote just because Ihave my Tory Burch one now and so I wentfor this one I love but I don't reallyhave anything this color in a tote styleso I just thought this was the perfectchoice it does have this kind of luggagetag with the Gucci sign right there Ithink I'm going to hang a pompom effectsI think it's gonna look really cute andI'm just really impressed in the stylealternate and so this is actually amagnetic closurecheck out tissue paper so you can seebut it's absolutely massive as you seeso there is a zip pocket right there andthen you have two more pockets there andthen it just kind of closes with amagnetic clasp which I absolutely love Ithink the quality of this bag is amazingand I got this a 40% off so I got areally really good deal I think and Ijust think that is so elegant and justreally nice looking it's big enough forme to use to work and this along with myTory badge total mean that I will get mypoor Neville a bit of a rest the onlything that was kind of sad about swag isthat because I think the tissue paperthe leather has gone a bit wrinkled isthere not wrinkled pages it's kind ofbeing padded out a bit weird I don'tknow if you'll be able to see it but myTory Burch tote was the same and that'sabsolutely fine as I'm hoping this willrecover as well but apart from that Iabsolutely love it and I'm so pleasedtook on such a good deal I was eyeing upthe top and pink colour as well butunfortunately that didn't go on sale soI opted for this one as well and Icouldn't be happier with it because Ijust think it's such a pretty prettycolour so that's it for this do you guysI hope you enjoyed it if you did pleasedo give it a thumbs up and subscribe tomy channel if you haven't already thankyou so much for watching and

welcome my name is Carolyn and Vigil I'ma Lululemon ambassador and I teachmeditation and yoga for everyone thismeditation is geared towards thoseanxious moments that we have in lifewhen we feel anxious our bodies tense upand harden and our thoughts become verycloudy so today I'll provide a body scanto help relax the physical tensions inthe body so that the mind can be moreclear and we can be more in control ofour choices and our thoughts so I'mgoing to ask you now to lie down on yourbacklie down bend your legs so that yourfeet are flat on the floor have yourfeet a little wider than hips distanceapart knees fall into touch and foldyour hands over your low belly closeyour eyes it can be such a sense ofrelief to lie on your back in meditationsometimes when we feel quite stressedout or anxious our bodies don't respondwell when we force ourselves to sit inmeditation the body can feel a lot ofpain and there's nothing wrong withlying downit's very supportive and invites in morerelaxation when you lie down arrive hereon your backthis is an opportunity for you to let goof effortto just pause and release maybe yearsand years of tension that you've beenholding on to we're gonna do a few deepbreaths together a signal is sent to thebrain when we take long exhales out ofthe mouth to relaxed immediately in anytime of day when you feel quite panickedand out of control in your whirlingthoughts you can always benefit bytaking a few cleansing breaths like thisso let's practice a deep inhale lettingyour belly balloon open filling up andthen out your mouth exhale again inhaleinto your palms feel the belly open thefull breath in and relax tension as youexhaleinhale filling up your lungs think aboutletting go as you exhalebreathe in again think about collectingany cobwebs or knots or uncomfortablethoughts as you breathe in and set themfree as you breathe outtwo more timestake the biggest inhale you can manageand the most relieving exhalefeel the tension melting away far beyondyour body far beyond your busy thoughtsthroughout the remainder of themeditation whenever your butt breathfeels stuck or short at any point pleasepractice that breath if you wish longexhales out your mouth you'll almostinstantly start to feel more relaxedsome people say that we spend 90% of ourlives living in our heads living in ourbrains and that the longest journey willever take is from the head down to theheart and into the body and essentiallythat's what a meditation practiceexplorer's is moving away from ouranxious and circular thoughts and cominginto what's real right now coming intowhat we have control overWe certainly have control over ourbreath and over our bodiesas I guide you through this scan it mayfeel uncomfortable or challenging to beaware of body parts that I'm guiding youthrough so you might instead imaginethat you're floating just above yourbody looking down at yourself in thosebody parts or you're floating below yourbody looking up take your focus intoyour feet and feel the soles of yourfeet on the floor or on the carpetwherever you are and imagine that you'refully relaxing the arch muscles in yourfeet and all your ten toestake your focus into your shins up yourknees and to your thighs and be aware ofyour sitting bones on the ground nowyour bum feel for letting go of anygripping in your sitting bones imagineyou're fully softening

tongue hangback heavily in your mouthgaze into your heart centerfeel a broadness in the chest sense ofspace around your heart centerand lastly your low belly and your palmsthe warmth of your palms resting on yourlow bellyit's said that many fearful or stressfulemotions live in our stomachs and so wetend to really grip when we're stuck inuncontrollable thoughts or fearfulthoughts so we get really tight and hardin our bellies what if you just let goin your belly with every passing breathyour body truly needs this kind ofrelaxation it signals to your mind toalso slow down and relaxremembering that this practice doesn'tnecessarily unfold overnight releasinganxiety or stress it's a daily practicea momentarily practice and above all begentle with yourself because when wemeet hardness in the body withjudgmental or hard thoughts we're unableto change what's going on for uslet's complete the practice together byscanning one more time from your feet toyour sit bones your shoulders back ofyour head eyes mouth heart stomach ifthere's any pain any spots of dullnesslet's free it open with one last deepbreath in clear it out your mouthmake a silent offering to move

capacity herenow this is not a super super highcapacity like you're not going to beable to fit the whole kitchen sink inhere guysthis is kind of more for basics like ifyou're going walking your dog if you'regoing for a grocery store aroundsomething like that is where i'drecommend the everywhere belt bag foryouso inside we can see that there is onebig pocket herethere's a middle area and then two sidepockets hereand they all look the exact same on theinside same setup with the one pocketand the two side pockets here and comingover to the backthere's a zipper here as well this isthe part that's

[Music]hi everyone abby heretoday i'm going to be reviewing thelululemon theyoga mat bag but before i get startedmake sure to hit that subscribe buttonso you can stay tuned to all my newvideos dropping weeklyand so you can help the channel growthis is purchased in the colorheritage camo jacquard max blacknow this can be used to hold virtuallyany yoga mat not just lululemon onesum basically i'd recommend this for anymat that is a five millimeter thickor less it does have a pretty snug fitwhen you do put it in here so i wouldn'trecommend going with anything over thatso this mat right here is fivemillimeters it is a little lemon matand when you do unzip it this doesn'tzip all the way down it onlygoes to here so one great thing aboutthis yoga mat bag is that it is verycomfortable onit has a nice carrying strap that is anice thickness and you can definitelyadjust itif you want it shorter or longer on youso it's definitely great for when you'reon the go or if you need to just throwin your carthis is comfortable to carry it and itdoes have an excellent water bottleholder right hereshowing you that it can fit a standard500 milliliterand it goes right in um there's nothingleft over so it completely covers yourwater bottleand you can tighten it and loosen it asyou see fit to make sure that it issecure in hereadditionally there is a pocket righthere this pocket can definitely holdlike a full-size cell phone if you wantto put your cell phone in hereit could also hold like cards snackseven like a little towel if you're goingto the gym and you want to use thatthereall right guys so i just want to giveyou guys an alternative in case youaren't ready to purchasethe lululemon yoga mat because i do knowit is expensive i also have a cheaperalternative here for youso this is the buoyance yoga mat bagthat i did purchase off of amazonand i want to show you guys kind of alittle bit of a comparison to see thedifferences between them sothe one major difference i could showyou guys is that this one completelyzipsall the way downso it makes it super easy to put in youryoga matwhile the lululemon yoga mat bag onlyzips half of the way down to herethat's one thing i really don't likeabout it i don't know why they just putthe zipper here i think they should haveput itall the way down to the bottom justbecause it makes putting your yoga matineven easier so i'm to do a little bit ofa demo and show you guys howeasy it is to put this in hereand i do want to mention that this bagfrom amazon the buoyancy yoga mat bagit does have a higher capacity so thisone is able to hold like basicallyalmost any yoga mat size even if it'slike7 10 millimeters thick it can definitelyhold in hereand to zip it upand just showing you guys in herethere's plenty of spaceso even when this is like fully zippedthere's lots of space hereand there we go this one also has apocket right here um this is like a nicebig pocket it goes from hereto here my whole hand fits in here soyou can definitely fit your phone inhereum any snacks cards anything like thatandon the bottom here it does have a pocketso for this pocket right here um here isa standard 500 milliliter water bottleand it fits right in so it's not bigenough for me to like close itwith the water bottle inside but it doesfit in no problemone last thing i want to mention or talkabout is the strap the strap right hereis nice and long and it is adjustablefor sure but i will sayum it's not as comfortable like to usewhen you're carrying it on your shoulderthere's just not much padding here andthethe strap is kind of thin so that's justsomething to noticedefinitely not the exact same quality asthe yoga mat bagfrom lululemon but i would say it'spretty good especially for the pricethat you're getting hereand i have had this one for about twoyears now and it's still going strong soso i'd say the quality is great guys andit comes in a bunch of different colorsguysnow i'm going to go ahead and put myyoga mat in the lululemon yoga mat bagso you guys can see kind of how it worksso the one thing about the lululemonyoga mat bag is because it is very slimfittedso you have to make sure that your matis tightly round but this one is not soit's not going to fit in thereso i'm going to go ahead and justtighten it up a little bit when i doroll itso i've gone ahead and rounded a littlebit tighter but on thelike advantage side for the amazon yogamat you can definitely fit it in whenyour mat is rolled really loose becauseit's designed to fit you know biggermats so here we go[Music]guys so i have had this yoga mat bag forfive months now and it's definitely verydurable and is holding up greati'm using it to store my yoga mat i liketo put my yoga mats in bags rather thanthe straps becauseit keeps them kind of dust free whileyou are storing themand i want to say that this materialhere is great it's definitely easy towashyou can hand wash it or you can throw itin the washing machine on low and thenjust hang it to dry whatever you preferit's a great material all right here'sthe tag for anybody who would like thatinformationit is also water repellent which isgreat if you're ever caught in the rainwhile you're carrying yoga mat bagso i've shown you all the differentpockets and kind of zippers on this bagso i do want to say that it's excellentfor holding all your yoga matsit's comfortable to hold and it fitsthem snugly and securelyalright guys so considering the pricequality the color the functionality thedurability and the ease of usei would go ahead and give this littlelemon the yoga mat bag a 9.3 out of 10and i definitely do give it a thumbs upif you're looking to buy the amazonbuoyancy yoga mat bag i've gone aheadand put the link in the description foryou to use so in america this starts

and let's getstarted with this stuff so I'm gonnastart with some of the products and thenwe'll get into the clothing cuz that'sreally the majority of the stuff I havethe first thing is a package that I gotfrom Colleen Rothschild and I've heardreally amazing things about this brandfrom my friend Marnie and a lot of otherpeople have talked about this butspecifically her I've actually liketalked to her off-camera about thisstuff and I was shocked when thispackage arrived in my PA box because Iwas not expecting anything I had nocontact with the company they didn'treally ask me to do anything they justsent me their products to try so theysent me the share renewal cream whichI've been using at nighttime which sofar so good I really like but I have tohave to have to rave about this productthis is the radiant cleansing balm andit's so luxurious so heavenly I've beenusing this for about a week and a halfyou really can't tell it's been thatlongcuz you really don't need a lot ofproduct that would almost comparecoconut oil same exact texture andconsistency of coconut oil and as soonas you put it into your your hands andthe warmth of your hands warms up theproduct it melts into an oil exactlylike coconut oil and quite frankly itfeels as moisturizing and soft on yourskin f coconut oilexcept it's not coconut oil it's areally good skin loving product and itworks to remove all your makeup dirt andgrind clean out your pores it comes witha muslin cloth you make it nice and warmit'll remove everything you really don'thave to cleanse after that like yourface will be squeaky cleanI have knock on wood had not had anyadverse reactions breakouts my skin hasreacted to this incredibly well I woulddefinitely give this a try you guys knowhow loyal I am to my Bioderma so when amakeup remover catches my attention andturns it away from Bioderma you know ithas to be a good one this is a productI've been wanting to try for a long timenow this is by macadamia and it's theirfoaming volumizer mousse and a lot ofpeople myself included love using dryshampoo and like texturizing sprays atthe roots when your hair is dry but thedifference with this is it goes on whenyour hair is wet back in the day when Iworked at a salon I had a root boosterit wasn't a mousse it was just kind of aspray and I loved it and then I ran outof it haven't really replaced it so thishas been amazing I really have noticed adifference with like just the root liftand the little volume that I get evenjust with a round brush and this productit's really great and as with any oftheir products they all smell so goodthree stops my skin Danai via spraysthis is just something that you guysknow I've been using forever I was allout of my makeup finishing spray I justneeded this can't be without it myprimer spray setting spray amazing sothis next thing I'm going to share withyou I picked up before I left forJamaica I've been wanting someheadphones for a long time now I do havea lot of ear buds and I love them forthe gym keep a pair in my car for thegym I keep a pair in my purse if I'mediting and I'm not at home but I reallywanted to get a pair to like wear fortravel on airplanes and things like thatbecause sometimes if you wear those budsfor too long they start to kind of hurtyour ear so I've had my eye on thefriends ones the rose gold and whiteones for a very long time even kind ofbefore the holidays but I recently sawthat they did a collab with bauble barwhich I've never purchased anything frombauble bar before this was my first timebut they did a collaboration where theykind of blinged out their headphones andthey made like an additional setexclusive to bauble bar you know me androse gold like I just can't say no so Ihad to get themI'll show you they're really cutepackaging that it came in I've had theselike I said for a while now but Iabsolutely love them and I've actuallybeen using these to edit with becausethey're just so comfortable also camewith a really cute pair of rose gold andcrystal stud earrings which I was notexpecting show you the other set so thetypicalfriends headphones come with the solidrose gold and if you pick them up frombauble bar you get the crystallized onesand they simply just twist off and youcan swap out the little bling bling Ican't even tell you how many complimentsI've gotten from me is on the airplaneand they're just so comfortable theseare so cushy like they feel really greatI love the sleek design that goes aroundyour head I mean normally the bigheadphones are like they're not cute onbut they're functional but they're notcute these are really cute and I reallylove the cord too it's almost like it'salmost like a shoelace like a reallythin shoelace it also has really cutedetail detailed little volume buttonshere in rose gold that you can adjustthe volume so I am obsessed with thesecame with the little leather pouch thatI showed you they also came with anotherone like just a really nice qualityheadphone and I'm so happy that I gotthem from bauble bar because like I saidI just can't I just can't say no to RoseBowl bling and they also come in likeblack and regular gold but I just lovethe sleek clean feel of the white androse gold so I've been loving those ifyou guys are interested in gettingyourself some new headphones Idefinitelyand the brand friends I've gotten theirear buds and the fabfitfun boxes andthey're just really good quality that'spicking up rose gold I was in a littleboutique by my house recently and theyhad one set left and I didn't even knowI'm living under a rock that didn't evenknow that Alex and Ani released rosegold bangles like shiny rose goldbangles and sure enough they did andthey had this beautiful set I guess theycalled it the love set and I think theydid it for Valentine's Day but I justgot it like a week ago but she said itwas the last set in store so I'massuming that they had them forValentine's Day you could probably stillfind this set online you get atraditional like typical Alex and Anibangle and it says love and cursive andthe rose gold and then these other twohave this one's all rose gold beadingand then this one has rose gold and kindof like crystal beading so they came ina set and I'm obsessed I love rose goldif you haven't noticed if you guys wantme to do an Alex and Ani collection Idon't have a massive collection but acouple people have been asking me tofilm that so if you guys want to seethat let me know and I'll be happy toshow you the little collection that I dohave and then the last little accessoryI want to share with you are someglasses and if you follow me on snapchatyou would have seen these already butthese are my Dolce & Gabbana but theseare rented and if you aren't familiarwith what the heck I'm talking aboutthere's a website called endless eyewearI think I had them in one of myfavorites videos I've become obsessedit's kind of rent the runway bag borrowsteal but for some designer sunglassesand swap them out whenever you want keepthem for as long as you want 24 dollarsa month you can actually purchase thosesunglasses on the website as well but upuntil now I've only just rented them andI've had quite a few pairs since Istarted looking into this company but Iwanted to share these with you becausethese have been my favorite favoritefavorite of all the ones that I've triedand I will be purchasing these these aremy Dolce & Gabbana and it's DG for tu-16I'm not sure of the name but I'll if Ican find the name I'll put it right herefor you but they're just a classic blackcat I like classic as classic can comeno frills no fancy things there iscute detail on the inside that I didn'teven notice when I scooped them off thewebsite but they are all done in likethe inside of the glasses are all redroses which are incredibly beautiful butI just love the simplicity of like justa normal cat eye there's nothing on thesides other than a little logo there'sno bling there just a black cat eye andI love them so like I said I will bepurchasing these but I wanted to sharethem with you because they're just sopretty and then this is the case alittle bulky not the best case to put ina crossbody handbag but I keep the casein my car most the times and then I justleave the glasses in my car okay sothat's everything as far as littleaccessories that I have some clothingthings again i snapchatted this this ismy favorite if you've already seen thisbut I went to Lululemon recently becauseI had a gift card Christmas I thinkpicked up some new leggings I honestlywasn't completely thrilled with whatthey had in store but you can never gowrong with our leggings and I can neverhave enough because they're kind ofpants I live in all the time so theseare technically workout leggings and Ihave worked out in them but I alsoreally got them just to kind of wear dayto day they're kind of a dark gray andthen the bottoms are kind of perforatedso there's a little air that can getthrough and they're just kind of cutethen they're more gathered around theankle they're not super high waisted butenough that it kind of sucks you in alittle but these are really comfortablereally great they came in a coupledifferent colors and then also I pickedup this sweaterapparently I have this gray sweateraddiction the last two years it's been awhite t-shirt addiction and now it'sbecoming a grey sweater but I love lovethis sweater and the best part is it'skind of this open back feel so I've beenwearing like my cage back bra or youcould wear our lacy bralette and it'sjust kind of drapey and really pretty inthe backreally really nice it's gathered aroundthe wrist and there is a little thumbhole if you wanted to wear it like thatI got it in a size 4 for reference thesize 2 was like too tight and I wantedit to be a little oversized and long itjust about covers my bum so yeahoops really cute and the leggings I'lljust tell you in case you're wonderingthey're in a small I usually get them ina small so that's all I got fromLululemon just quickly depleted my giftcard and then I'll show you some thingsthat I got from Target I got a ton ofEaster dress is really cute Easterdresses so I let her pick and she pickedthis one and this really pretty greenlittle little chiffon and flowers it'slike a little swing dress up a littlekind of like butterfly ruffle sleeves socute and this one I freaking died when Isaw itit's mint with these fuchsia pom-pomtrims around the sleeves and the bottomthis was $17.99 it's a really nice softcotton this dress was $23.99 in caseyou're wondering then I got her someshoes because for one her feet frickingrow like weeds and none of her shoesfrom last spring are gonna fit her thisyear so I got beautiful pink and goldgladiators like and they zip up the backI love themgot her these gold ones which look a lotlike the ones from the lily and Targetcollab which I got for her from thatcollab but like I said she's not gonnafit in them anymore and I love goldsandals because they go with everythingthey match everything and they're simpleand they're comfortable for her and thenfor her Easter dress I had to get herthese because I really didn't have shoesfor her to wear with her dresses herEaster dress they're just little whiteMary Jane's with little daisies on themand the little flower like velcro andmommy loves velcro cuz it's fast anyother random things I found these notecards in the dollar spot section theyhad a lot of note cards so I just lovethe colors of these it's like peach andpurple really cute some magnets randomrandom random and then I got this formyself this was right across from theclothing but I like the beach hats andstuffit's this really pretty open lace longcardigan and I just got it as a beachcover-up or just something to throw onover my bathing suit but I suppose itwould be really cute with like aBarcelona cami and some distressedboyfriend jeans or white jeans tooI just think it's really pretty stuffthat is all I got from Target lastly Iscooped up some clothing from romwebasically like a forever 21 stylewebsite honestly its hair miss but thistime around I hit bigs and stuff that Igot look the same as it did on thewebsite it's really good quality I'vealready watched everything it didn'tlike shrink or deform or anything likethat so I'm really really impressed andI love these pieces that I got sosticking with the lace I got this offthe shoulder beautiful lace top it'sjust so gorgeous so simple but it's sogorgeous and I thought this would bereally fun for spring and summer to justwear off there's like nothing betterthan tan shoulders and then off theshoulder white bright bright white topso I got this - just go with white ordenim or Jean cut-offs really prettysimple so got this maxi dress I reallywanted to take this to Jamaica with mebut I didn't get my order in time butit's just really bright and floral andcolorful I love it because you canadjust the straps so in this area whereI am lacking you can tighten them up soit zips up the side this is what theback looks like crisscross and it'sreally really long to the floor and it'skind of like a really nice silkymaterial it's so beautiful on if you'replanning any kind of vacations and theseare all like right under a rant rightaround $20 it's insane and then this oneI got just cuz it was so simple it'skind of like this minty blue and Ithought it would be really cute withsome long tassel jewelry in the backagain having a moment with laceapparently is really really pretty justa simple little beach dress likevacation dress cute little strap thatgoes across there too so this I've seencouple websites and it always looksadorable on the models so I ordered itbut haven't tried it on yet so we'll seebut it's kind of like a sweatshirt comfycozy lounge romper but it's shorts but Ifeel like the shorts need to be a littlebit baggy err I feel like they're alittle like too fitted they look reallyfitted but I love the top and then ithas a tie in the back but I just thoughtthis would be cute for kind of likehanging around the house or in betweenweather like season changes with justsome converse sneakers or something Ithought be really cute so I'm still onthe fence about that but the last threeI showed you I'm obsessed with shoppingon revolves sale section on theirwebsite and I found this maxi dress forlike $40 I think it was regularly over ahundred and it's just a super long silkpeach almost again like a silky materialand then the top guess what it isit's a lace crochet and then it justties around your neck so it's verysimple the back is all open it's kind ofgathered it's Brides a brand lost inlost in AlyaI think yeah last last in the Lila in ablush they're calling it blush I'd sayit's more peach but I do need to takethis to my seamstress and get it fittedmore because because I have nothing tohold it up with I need to just have ittaken in in the back a little bit butonce it's fitting me properly I knowit's gonna be really pretty just withlike some fun gladiator sandals like tojust hang around the beach we have somevacations coming up so I just wanted toget some easy breezy maxi dresses and Ijust think this I'm just obsessed this Idon't know what else to say has a reallypretty like sweetheart scalloped top butlike $40 you can't go wrong I did getthis in an extra-small and it's huge onme I think even if I was larger in thisarea it would still be a little bit bigso you're gonna try to get this I wouldsize down one or two if they had anextra extra small I probably should havegotten it so that's everything that Igot reallyrandom if you guys enjoyed this videogive it a thumbs up so I know and I'lldo these more and not kind of break themup into like clothing accessory isn'tjust do

hi it's gene here and welcome back to mychannel reviews by Jamie so today I'mgoing to be doing a workout clothes haulwhich I'm so excited about because I'mtrying to motivate myself to just likeget healthier and lose weight and Iactually really do need to lose weightbecause first of all my BMI isoverweight again and I gained like 20pounds since the summer so not too happyabout that so I'm really just like kindof just kind of easing back into it andI've been eating a little bit better ifyou've been following me on instagramreviews by jamie then you would noticethat i've been posting some healthierrecipes things that i've been eatingi haven't been to the gym in months ican't even remember when i know that itwas warm out still so it's definitelybeen a while but this time i just wantto start eating better just for ahealthier lifestyle because i juststarted getting more into the mindsetthat food is more like a medicine andsomething to help nourish your body andi've been feeling guilty lately puttingbad things into it not guilty enough tonot do it all the time but guilty enoughthat i'm trying to change it and it'skind of a slow process i'm not likegoing right into diet mode countingcalories i just want to see if i canstart losing weight like by taking it alittle bit slowly and healthier decidedto get some new workout clothes becausethat motivates me when i go shopping fornew stuff this is one of the things igod I'm so excitedit's from Lululemon and I've nevergotten anything from there except for acouple headbands but I thought you knowwhat I'm just gonna do it because I feellike I can wear it as a workout shirtand just like out in the summer becauseit is so cute and I just love the doublestrap and the back of it's amazing tooso it kind of like hangs a little andvery strappy I just think it's so prettyI love the color it's called vintagepink and I just love it so this is thefirst thing I got dual purpose tank topa lot of the things that I got were fromTarget so let me show you something notfrom Target so I got this shirtyesterday and it is ajust like a Nike t-shirt but I reallylike it because it's not like a fullsleeve and it's like a little bigger andboxier ish and I just think it'll bereally nice and casual especially nowthat I'm trying to lose weight and Ifeel like my stomach sticking out Idon't feel like it it is sticking out soI need to kind of conceal stuff a littlebit so the rest of it is from Targetokay I do have a bathing suit that Ihave in here this is from Victoria'sSecret it's not a workout outfit butit's another piece of motivation for meand I thought it was really cute it'skind of like really bright yellow greencolor which i think is really flatteringand it has these little ruffles and thenit's like a halter thank you and then tomatch it I didn't want to do like amatchy match so I got a black bottomthat also has the ruffle so it kind ofmatches and I like how the black lookswith this bright color and then the backis kind of like cinchy a little bit likecinched so I thought it was cool andobviously not gonna work on it but I'mgonna wear it once I start working outmore the rest of this is from Target anda lot of things were on a good sale thiswas not this was $26.99 and I reallylike this because it's also the doublestrap so if you're looking for a cheaperalternative to this they do have theseat Target right now and one other colorbut I liked it and it's a little tighterat the bottom so not as like loi ish asthis even though it's not that floaty onme right now but I like it it has abuilt-in bra some of their built-in brasare see-through and it's and I actuallyhave a couple from Target where theyhave a built-in bra and I wear a sportsbra under and it's like so tight where Ifeel like I'm gonna explode but so Imade sure that this was not see-throughand it's not and I got this I reallyreally liked this and it was on a reallygood sale for 748 thought it would begreat for spring because it's a verythin white kind of with like a littlehood in the back here and also reallycute it feels like a little cinchingdetail right through here and it's alittle sheer so you can even wear like asports bra under it and put this on topthat's how I tried it on and it lookedreally cool but I don't knowand I can wear it like that but I wantto really bad but you can do like a tanktop on Jerry and then when if you getlike hot when you're working out thenyou can just take it off and then I gotthis t-shirt and this was 20 and Ireally like wasn't shirt on it but thenI decided you know what it's such a goodsimple one to have because I'm gettinglike some little tank tops and cutelittle things but why not just have abasic one that I can wear with a lot ofdifferent things it has the line in themiddle so it adds a little bit moreinterest oh and then I got a pair ofleggings and then I got a sports bra sojust like this one and I liked itbecause the back was like thinner strapsinstead of like a thicker one so Ithought that would be really nice tohave and then the last couple of thingsI got also from Targetthey have good what about clothes whatcan I say I actually tried forever21 andthe material was so like rough andhorrible I couldn't even do it and I canaccept a lot of cheap things but thatwas just too much for me but target Iliked their clothes and I think they'rereally cute too and you get good dealsso why not oh that reminds me this tookme like so long to put on the secondtime around it was a lot easier like cuzthe first time when I was just trying iton I was like why I'll just talk whileI'm trying to undo this and I still wantanother um Lululemon top it's the nolimits one I think those are reallyreally cute I just don't know if I cando the splurge and do it because thiswas already a splurge so I don't knowmaybe it'll be a reward if I lose weightgot it okay so here is weight here isthis t-shirt and they have these in afew colors I love the light blue and Ijust think that it's just soft andcomfortable and the back is reallyreally cute because it's a little bitopen kind of like three little holeslike that you can wear you know yoursports bra under obviously it's kind ofa little sheer and wear something underand I really liked it and then the lastthing I got was another thing becauseyou know it's still cold right now andwhenever I go to the gym although it'shard to remember because it was so longagowhen I used to go back in the day um youget there and it's like if you come infrom the outsideit's cold and if you're just standingthere in a tank top

and itkind of like flares out a little which ithink is cute and then it has kind oflike a little cowl-neck here you can seeyour tank top or t-shirt or whateverthrough it so it looks still reallyreally

hey guys so today I'm doing a Lululemoncollection video in case you aren'tfamiliar with Lululemon it's basicallylike a yoga workout clothing store Inever really used to have a lot of itbecause I didn't really work out but nowthat I've been in college and you getlike a gym membership to the gym herethree as a student oh I've been going tothe gym a lot more so because of thatI've been really into workout clothesand Lululemon's workout clothes are suchgood quality and they're so nice andcute so it's kind of hard to not buythem gulaman can be a bit of aninvestment so I thought it would be coolto show you guys the pieces I have andthe things I like and don't like so youguys can be kind of more familiar withthe products in case you want to buysome I got in fighting through thisvideo from

first thingI'm gonna start off with is likeheadbands and I have two from Lulu Idon't believe our headbands a lot unlessI'm working out just because I feel likemy head looks like an egg when I wearthat but Lulu's are really good becausethey have like a rubbery part on theinside so it really likes doesn't likeslide back and it sticks to where youput it so I have this like medium withgrey one it just has like a little logoand then I also have a thicker blackline and I sweat a lot so these are goodbecause my hair is literally droppingwhen I'm done in the gym so I like theheadbands um once again I only wear themwhen I'm working out because I look likean egg but I do recommend the headbandsmoving on I'm going to talk about sportsbras and I apologize I do not know thenames for all of the things I have um Iwish I did but if I do know them I'lltotally let you know so I do know thatthis sports bra is the free to be wildsports bra and this is like probablytheir most popular one it's just the onethat's like super strappy in the backthis is so cute if you're wearing like atank top with an open back or just likea back you can see um yeah so I justhave the black oneand then the next sports bra I got isvery like funky but I got it on sale soI didn't feel like bad about buying itbut basically it's this really cool likekind of pixelated floral pattern um butI got it because the back is so coolonce again it strappy I have a thing forlike strappy back things so I wear thisone with a tank I have that the back islike super low I have a one pair ofshorts cool lemon um I'm not really wearworkout shorts that often I'm more oflike a cropped legging type of personbut these ones are really cute andreally flattering so I think these arethe swiftly shorts I'm not completelysure but they look like this they arevery short so if you have like reallylong legs but you're really tall thesemight not be the best for you but theybasically have like kind of a spandexywaistband and then it's more of like anathletic material short it's really nicethey have like a zipper on the back Ilove with lemons things and zippers onthe back I think it looks cute and it'sfunctional okay next I'm going to gointo crop leggings so I like crops themost when I'm working out if I wearfull-length leggings I get way toosweaty so just this like little inch ofskin that is like left from crops I feellike makes a big difference I don't knowso I do have one pair of the wonderunder cropped but I lost them like Ihave no idea where they are I'm playupset because those are my plain blackones I don't know where they are I hopeI didn't like accidentally throw themout or something because I searched myentire dorm room and I can't find themso that's upsetting but I'm gonna showyou my other crops okay so the first oneis I have these are kind of an oddmaterial but there's some of myfavorites they're not really blackthey're not really grey they're notreally Navy I'm not totally sure whatcolor they are but they look the closesttube laughs at anything elseum this look like this they're like veryweird material I don't know how toexplain ithe's like a better look at the materialit's very thick very stretchy umI don't know what to explain it but Ireally love this material it really likesucks you init has like a high waistband and thenthe logo is just down here the next pairof crops Ihave is that same material but this isthe in the flow crop and basically theylook super weird off because they likecurl up but when you wear them they looknormal they just have like bruising onthe side so this is a burgundy pair Ialso got these on sale these ones arevery flattering the logo is like rightunder your butt so it looks like reallyflattering I don't know but I reallylike these ones as well okay so my lastpair of crops I really love these onesthey're so cool I don't know the stylethese I got these on eBay actually um Ijust thought they were so cool butthey're more like a spandex eworkgroupmaterial so they feel more like yourtypical workout material I don't knowhow to explain it but yeah they'rebasically navy blue and then they havethis really really cool floral print andthen at the bottom it goes into likethis Navy kind of heather print and thensome Navy mesh so these are really funkyand really cool okay moving on tofull-length pants the first ones I'mgoing to show you are the groove pants Ithink they're basically your classiclike Flair of yoga pants um these onesalready wonder under material so likethey are pilling I'll kind of get upclose to show you what I mean yeah so Idon't know how well you can see that butas you can see they do pill on the butta little bit which like is quiteannoying because you are paying a lotfor them but Lululemon basically hasthis return policy whereas if like yourpants pill or whatever and you can likesend them a photo don't get you they'llgive you like an e gift card so you canlike return them and get a new pairwhich I take an advantage of with mypants that are this material becausethey do pill even when you do followlike the washing instructions soalthough this is their mostly popularmaterial I don't know if I reallyrecommend it because they pill but atthe same time you can get a new pair ofpants so it's like yeah anyway so theseare just black like flared yoga pants Idon't know where these ones that oftenthey have a little logo there the goodthing about Lululemon is if you areshort like me they will have your paircertain like shirts and anything forfree when you buy them so that's reallygood I had to have like so much offthese pants because laboux pants runvery long I have another pair of pantsin that style these are literally myfavorite ones are just plain blackleggings these are the High Times pant Idid have the wonder under but I likethese ones more because they'rehigh-waisted and they're seven eightseven eighths length so if you're surelike me the seven eighths line is likeperfect it goes burnt linked to yourankle so if you're sure definitely keepthat in mind but I've only had these forlike a month and they're already pillingand I really have washed them accordingto instructions so that's super annoyingthe next two I have also 7/8 length butonce again they're full length on me sothese are the Nspire crop now inspiredtight I think I could be wrong but Ireally love these I have two pairs ofthese so the first one is this crazypattern I really tried these on as ajoke because I was trying on a black topand I ended up really liking them andthey were on sale so they're this crazyblack white and gray pattern they havelike some mesh up here and then they godown and then as you can see this flatpart right here is matched and I cut offlike right at the angle these are soflattering the material is once againthat like classic workout material andsomething else I love about them is thatthey have zippers right here I don'tknow if you can tell but I think this isjust like a really cute detail and it'sfunctional because you can feel likekeys and cards and to like ease andstuff like that in them so these onesare so cute and then I also have them inthis gray colorI think grey colored leggings are soflattering they make your butt look sogood so I just have them in gray inblack you can kind of see the differencewhat you can see the zippers better onthis one and then they go down and theyhave this little mesh peep at the bottomokay so I almost forgot I have one morepair of crops they were just in thelaundry so these are the Wonder undercrops once again except they're in gradeso you can't really see pilling I don'treally notice it as much as I would onthe black ones at all and I've had thesefor a good amount of time but I lovegray leggingsI said they're so cute and these onesare really comfy so wonder under-cooksokay so those are all the pants that Ihave so I'm going to move intoshort-sleeved shirts now I have two andthese are probably my favorite materialof shirts that Lulu has so I think theseare the swiftly T or swiftly I reallycan't talk to swiftly tech T orsomething like that you'll definitely beable to find them on the website butit's this really cool material I'm sureyou've seen it before so this is what itlooks like I really don't know how toexplain it but it's so cool andcomfortable and really flattering so Ihave one of these shirts in this kind ofheathered teal color and then I have onein this like light burgundy berry colorwhich is really cute as well and theseare some of my favorites they're soflattering and I love them I have a tankin that same style so it's just thisthing is called black berry Rumble orsomething I don't really know but it's atank top the same material I really likethe tank tops because like I said I getso sweaty when I work out so sometimesthe short sleeve shirts or like even toomuch so I really love this tank a lotand it's such a pretty color okay thenext thing I have is the Y tanksomething like that anyways it's aclassic style I have the same kind oflike heathered purpley color you'regoing to see I really like like goespurpley colors but yeah really cute Ihave like a built-in bra such a classicand I really like this one okay I thinkthis is called the wild tank it's verysimilar to that one bra because the backthe bras like built-in and it's allstrappy which is really nice because youdon't have to worry about wearing asports bra with it it has been built inand then it's just kind of like drapey Idon't know if you can see but this one'slike navy blue okay this next thing IhaveI'd only know I got it it was on saleI'm not really a fan but it's just thisbright purpley color it's like a normaltimeand then the back has like a little meshsegment and then it's like a y in theback yeah I'm not a huge fan of this onebut I mean I still wear it I just don'tthink it's like the cutest one ever thelast tank I have is called the happystrappy tankI remember that one because of the nameum so basically it's just a black tankin the front pretty normal and the backis really cute which is why I got it andI'm pretty sure I got this one on saletoo I really try to get Lulu on sale asit is pretty pricey but as you can seeit has some straps and X and then likethree more little straps okay lastly I'mgoing to talk about my jackets so I havethree kind of jacket things from will bethe first one I'm really never wear Ihonestly might be selling this onPoshmark or more card pretty soon so I'mgoing to put my usernames and my invitecodes to those down below those arebasically like after you can sell yourclothes so if you're interested in thisor any other things I have for saledefinitely check it out but I just Imean this stuff it's really huge like areally nice berry color for just alittle bit long for my liking um it'squite quite long has a nice collarreally cute but I just wouldn't wear itas if because I feel like it's too longon me to be zipped I have one like halfzip kind of thing I can get it situatedthis one's kind of like a sweater IImaterial I don't know if you can tellbut it's really soft just a little halfzip and then the bottoms have like someblack got on sale I get lots of thingson sale Hulu so this one's cute nicejust lounge around in okay last thing inthe hall probably one of my favoriteLulu items if you have to get one thingokay I would say like leggings but ifyou want to get a jacket definitely getthis jacket it's the define jacket it'sso flattering you've probably seenpeople wearing it honestly it's prettypopular hopefully I can kind of show youso I just have a black one it'sbasically it's like pretty short it'snot Rachel along with theother one it just like is really reallyflattering kind of hugs your curvesyou'll see it better in the Tryon but Ialso really like the back of it lookslike that okay so hopefully this videowas not too long I know I have a lot ofstuff like going through this I'm

Lululemon reports earnings on ThursdayMarch 26 I'm here with Jack Mooredirector of research for Action Alertsplus of believes this stock is a buybefore we get those results so Chuckyou've been buying shares of Lulu forthe charitable trust he picked up somelast week after a goldman sachs analystsdowngrade the stock to sell from neutralwhat do you think the analyst is wrongyeah I think that the analyst theinsights competition sites Canada andweakness and all of these kind ofstructural issues that I just don'tthink are real issues I think Canadathey have to address that but therethat's such a small part of theirbusiness that you really have to focuson the brand in the US and that's goingwell I mean everything that we're seeingall of the metrics all of the trafficmetrics the company itself said inJanuary that its sales were trackingmuch higher than well above the industryit's taking more market share and so Ithink they're wrong on the competitionpart because I think it's rising abovethat the competition but I think they'realso wrong in valuation because they saythat it's overvalued but it for thegrowth it has like 8% comparable storesales I think will happen in thisquarter it's only trading at thirtytimes earnings I mean there are a lot ofretailers trading at almost that amountand or more with half of the growth thatthey have so I think it's a reallycompelling way to get into the stock offthis ten percent fall in shares sure andthis upcoming earnings report will besignificant will be the first one forthe company since its newest product sobeing as you are still picking up sharesand have you picked up some today how doyou think those will have performed wellI think they're going to come throughwell and I really think it also have tolook at it in comparison last year waslike their worst quarter ever the firstquarter so there it was the weather wasterrible I think they had some executionissues operational issues and theyweren't seeing the traffic but over theover the cup you know coming twelvemonths they've completely transformedtheir business in a way that I thinkit's going to drive out size growthoutside sales outsized earnings and Ithink that I think the analyst communityespecially after this downgrade is inthe investors are so much more bearishheading into this quarter and that'ssuch a rare opportunity because they'realmost always bullish heading intoLula's quarters so I mean it could be ahuge beat I think well and although theshares to take a hit on the Goldmandowngrade haven't really recovered sincethey have been climbing for the past sixmonths or so so would you say anypullback is an opportunity what do youthink yeah I mean they've had a prettyparabolic rise andone point we were up 45% in the name andthen just recently now it's only 25 27percent and so we're looking at thatthat spread differential nothing'sreally changed in the meantime besidesthe Coleman downgrade I don't think onedowngrade from an analyst that missedthe 80 percent rise in shares when itsaid to sell is really that credible soI actually think that it's a good timeto buy right now I think it might beyour last opportunity to get in at adiscount ahead of the quarter greatadvice thank you so much Jack Mooredirector of research for Action Alertsplus thank you and I'm Brittany Tamarfor the street,25,UCp6aBHRM6ZS_kLeC57HV4kg,Jim Cramer & TheStreet,0,0,0,0,"['Portal:Market Updates', 'Action Alerts Plus', 'Earnings Previews', 'Housing Market', 'Retail', 'Video: Markets', 'YouTube', ':LULU', ':GS', 'Jack Mohr', 'Brittany Umar', 'Market Strategy']",Now Is Your Chance to Buy Lululemon at a Discount Before Earnings,NPgV3dxhIzk,775

be more than happy to getback to you so this is the expand yourlimits bra I normally have very bad luckwith the limit sports bras I'm obsessedwith their pants and a few of theirother jackets and items but for somereason their balls have not had the bestlook and I am in love with this bra sothis is a size 6 I am 5 foot 4 and ahalf and 122 poundsobviously I'm a smaller framed woman andI don't have big boobs obviously but Ireally like this because it shows thegirls and it's really sexy and this isthe back look and I like it because it'sreally comfortable on me it still it canexpand this much I hate the feeling oftrying to rip off my sports ball and Ican't get it off like I will not if Itry on a sports bra and I can't easilytake it off I'm not gonna purchase itand it doesn't cut off my circulationright here so it's really important tome and I also got one in black just gota fit has built in padding but as youcan see I'm gonna tuck in the tag thisis what it looks like really impressedand it's just I can't get over you guysthe material on her they're actuallyquarter length but I am not sure thename of them if you guys want to take amental check of the type of material Iam in love with these pantsthey're the alignedOh pants that I am so obsessed with andthey have the matching bra for all ofsize six and these pants are a size orlove how stretchy the material is theydo go all the way down and this is blackcamo I was really excited when I foundthese because I've been wanting camo andI've not been able to find anything withcamo and I did get these pants also ingreen and camo just because I was soexcited about it I didn't get the camogreen supports ball because I was likeokay I'm not gonna have to camo outfitsso I did get them in green size four andthen I actually I did purchase I bringhome a size six just in case because thesix fits me really nice too but the fourfits just I do run in between sizes forLulu with my pants any time I wear pantswith a thinner material such as theseI'll do a size four but if they'rethicker material I'll go up a size to asize six didn't pick up a pair of theirsocks and I'm actually gonna return themthey said small medium did like themit's really cool because the backs ofthem and here are sticky so they stay onthe back ear heel except they were waytoo small for my feet I do wear a size 8and I have wider fee I don't know ifthat's why so I'm gonna returning theseplus I don't even need low rice suckslike these for some reason I thoughtthey were gonna be more covered up tothe top wonder under HR crop 23 no fussadjustable rise crops designed to fityou like skin perfect for yoga or thegym I love the bottoms of them I thinkthey're super cute and girly and theyhave a little mesh fabric see-through onthem so these definitely give you a verymuch so hugged sensation and you canroll them down if you want but Idefinitely would never roll them down Ithink that's kind of weirdhere'sthey look like as you can see they'rereally fancy I love them and theydefinitely hug your body this is my nextoutfit I have on this is called free tobe serene high neck this is a size six$58 and as you can see it has a reallycutestrappy back it's just super funobviously this cuts up a little bit highit was just okay and since I'm coveredup here it makes me still feel morecovered up I actually probably wouldthink it would be cute if it's a littlelow it's really great material nice andthick once again it's fitting my ribcagebetter so I think Lulu's been doing abetter job at appropriately sizing theirsports bra and then I have on thesetrain times 7/8 pants and you all I havethem in black and I'll show you themI'll stand up but I also have them ingrey and in green and I've had thesepants forever and I warned them morethan I could possibly ever count both ofthese pants such an amazing investmentand they both have mesh on the side thatgoes all the way up to here if you don'thave any lulu pants and you want toinvest in a pair that will last you forforever that really make you feelsupported and don't make you feel nakedwhen you're wearing them these pants areamazing as you can see the sides theyhave the see-through all the way downwhich makes them look super sexy okayokay just kiddingtotally kidding so I love love lovethese pants I will buy them in everysingle color until they stop making themand okay so this is my last bra this iscalled free to be serene bra size sixand it was fifty two dollars and Iactually think I'm gonna return it youcan see the back once again it's niceand strappy I like it because it fitsreally nice once again it is a size sixbut it feels great on me I just feellike it doesn't do much for me I don'tknow so I was gonna return these I didnot get at my most recent purchase I gotthem about a year and a halfand I just wanted to show you because Inoticed they still are selling them inthe store and I like them becausethey're fitted when you zip them up Ilike that it covers somewhat of the buttand then you can put your hands throughhere it has two side pockets betternight and the only thing I don't like iswhen it's unzipped I just I don't likehow it sits flows out more but that's okthat's what you get that's why it's sonice and form-fitting when it zipped uplet's be real if we're gonna be wearinga jacket probably we're cold and mostlikely we need to have it zipped up Iwill probably not buy another style ofthis jacket again but I in no way regretthis purchasewho knows maybe in another year or two Ido want to get this same style again Idefinitely use these all of the timethey're really awesome jackets I don'tknow the name of I've never gotten ashirt with an open back and you'resupposed to tie it I will not buyanother one of these shirts again justbecause it's not really me some othergirls might have really great luck andlove it but oh my doing this I justwanted to show you all it's nice to havebut I could find something else to spendmy money on that I love a lot more notknow the name of this outfit but it is amatching set I just want to get close soy'all can see the material it's allrigid I love how thick it is it makes metotally support it the top is a size 6and the bottoms once again is 6 so anytype of Lululemon clothes where thebottoms fit a little snug or they'rethicker I will always get a size 6 andonce again I am 5'4 and a half and Iweigh 122 poundscurrently some thing I really do like isthe detail at the bottom that Lulu likesto have on their pants they have youknow they have a lot of detail on theirclothing and that's something that Ireally do like and admire about theirclothes is another great fine and putit's mesh very lightweight definitelynothing to wear if you want to stay warmbut I just think it's really classy andI love material as you can see it has apocket inside of here or you can put acredit card or something like that or akey you want to wear it as a run butthis is really nice this is not a recentpurchase and it is a size four this isanother sports for all I have from Luluit has built-in padding which issomething I really like not sure whatsize it is it doesn't say but this isalso not a recent purchase but I justwanted to show it to you because it'sreally nice and I do like to wear thesewith my purple pants I had on when Ifirst showed you so and then I just wantto go in a few extra sets with you Ipurchased this set together nottraditionalLulu style leggings they have this overthe holiday you really love the sportsbras that came with it size six onceagain and I did get it in maroon findthat person a few of these just theirother pants I don't know the names ofthese the only thing is is the materialwith these very kind of soft thin lulupants it gets worn really quickly ifyou're gonna buy black pants I seriouslyrecommend getting the Oh train timesseven eight pant they're gonna last youway longer I believe personally than thejust the normal soft thinner blue Lupants but at the same time you all likeI said I train in my and work heavy mineI wear mine all the time so I like wearthem like they're normal clothes I don'twear normal clothesI do wear these I wanted to show you Ihave these once again super super thinand these I seriously do feel a littlenaked in and these are a size six andthese are really really thin so I couldprobably wear either or four or six Ijust like to be comfortable on myclothes and I don't want anything tootight on mebecause I wear them all the time andthat concludes my Lululemon haul nowsome tips I want to recommend to you allis washing all of your clothes yourLululemon clothes together on a delicategentle cycle in cold water and insideout as well as air drying them and thatway that will help preserve the qualityof them and allow them to last longerand something that I don't know if youguys noticed or not but I don't have anyof their shorts for some reason I justfeel as if the cheeks are hanging out alittle too much with the shorts so Idon't yet half a pair however I'm notopposed to investing in a parent's justnot something that's on the top of mypriority list especially living inSouthern California it's actually prettychilly here a lot and so I find myselfwearing pants so if you guys found anyvalue on this you enjoyed it you gotanything from it please be sure to leaveme a comment below like and once

so we're gonna show you a bunch of thatI'm gonna give you guys some good tipsbuying clothing for guys like you someinsight yeah my ears are mostly girlslike 90% female so obviously you're notgonna buy the clothes each time you votebut a lot of you so when the boyfriendsor dads or brothers and I would not knowlike the details of what you want okayI would not know any time what he wouldwant me to like get for him so I figuredit'd be good for him to provide a littleinsight on why take funny pictures andyeah and basically we decided that we'regonna spend a lot of money because wefirst of all work hard for our money andmore person and second of all because wedecided that we're just sick of likethrowing away and wearing like just badquality stuff all the time and it's justlike a waste of money to be honestbecause you might have 10 like crappyshirt but they all suck and I rathernice yeah let's get started we're justgonna like switch off we're in sort ofpants so my favorite pants that I got Igot three pairs are just one they arecalled the sock buff pants and they'relike joggers I got the charcoal graycolor um so basically joggers are likefitted sweats I guess they're liketailored slipping and they have anelastic at the bottom and basically Idon't like those nothing superremarkable about these they just fitreally well they the material super softthey have theI'm on a stretch they have these cutelittle pockets in the front and thenyeah I got them in like a charcoal graycolor I got the same size that would getfor leggings and these were $98 both ofus since we are fitness professionalsboth work at gyms he's training I was inhere you can sign up for the arm Dprogram their research yeah and you canget 15% off you SEP to provide proofthat you like our fitness professionaland that the premise of it is you puttheir clothes like to use and givefeedback so that's actually how drew gota free pair of shorts yesterday yepthat's kind of safe not why it's fineokay first one these are prepareactually yeah hey okay so thinking abouta lot of Leuven in shorts they don't allhave this but a lot of them do to startand come on with us more is they yeahthey have like a compression sort oflining on the inside you can see thatbut they have two kinds they have a meshinsert which is kind of like if you havea guy like it's like swimsuits you stillhave these all the time before they cameon with foreign shorts like a meshlining so you don't wear underwearbasically but now they're coming outwith like a compression short tightlining which is way more comfortable toreplace that so if you see those go forthat style I would recommend if you'regoing to get something with the liningin itthere's like um apparently these make mylittle okay I'm sure you do so it's thatbubble butterflies okay and then thenext pair of pants I got our leggingsthese are the Beyond Boundaries pantsand these are brand new on they justcame on a website like a few days agonot that I check it every day oranything but this is what they look likeI got be like all this green color butthey are just different and then theback I know it's really hard as hell butthere's like this perforation down theside and then when you wear them theperforation is like snake skin print sothat's really cooland I don't have any of this colorpocket in the back and then I preferlike the high waisted leggings I don'teven buy the low-rise that means anymoreanyways I just like the way these arecut a lot the bottoms to have like acurved edge which is and these were ahundred years two dollars so that's thatdid you get any more camp I got one morepair of shorts I need pants this time Ihave a pair at home that I use all thetime you're probably gonna go back butnot right away like once the weathergets chillier and we need more like longsleeves and I'll need more jackets andmore sleep so easily make sure I getthese ones don't have a lining on theinside so we just like regular shortsthe materialso a really nice and then a lot of mostLululemon shorts guy starts to have apocket with a zipper which is reallyreally convenient because like yeahbecause guy shorts are really like thepockets aren't that good for holdingstuff like bad evil stuff especially soif you got like a zipper pocket on thereI feel like they just put a lot of likethought into their clothes and make themvery like a what's word um practicallike everything is there for a reasonthough useful yeahand then my third pair of pants that Igot I was yesterday and I love them ohit I'm gonna take anymore I want to saythey're high times I think to the hightimes pant but they're also high waistedand their material is so comfy on thesethey're like it's like caught me in itbut story starts you know Paik they'regreat with these are full lengthactually these are shorter than liketheir normal length ones like they hitme right at my ankle and I'm 5'4 andusually they like punch at the bottom somaybe they're not a crop though I don'treally know maybe they're theseventeenth span I really like thesethey're called fabric I have not seenthose on the website I don't think butthat's why you gotta like going to thestore because you actually can see thetexture of the fabric and you know Ireally give you a super thank you I donot get a free pair shorts but they saidthey're doing like a guy's initiativeright now probably because most of theirR&D people are females just because guysdon't I feel like guys in Lulu are likereally starting to catch on though a lotof guys in my school where Lulu but Iknow that that's not super common guysdon't spend a lot of money on clothesyeah but you should because it makessuch a big difference like youwe're here to swap hands from Lulucompared to a pair of spell fans fromlike a target they look so muchdifferent even if they're the same likecut or less you don't do that by like Ihave one pair from that I've worn likeall the time unless you're me but that'sall the pants that we got correct allright actually got three different Ididn't get any real they're like myshirts I got three different tank topsthey're all cut differently which Iactually didn't realize at first but yesI'm Trustin yeah I did but I mean likewhen I was picking them out Oh first oneis kind of like a classic like baby blueshirt yeah babyso this is like the highest cut onecomes with my armpit kind of thing yepcool thing about Lulu's shirts is thatwell first of all to give you thatquotes on the inside not jeans by Aaronsee itsuch fitness can't score without goalsand in a weave in a silver like a silverliningokay which is I get older resistantbacteria so MercyMe and it's likeantimicrobial odor resistant like butthat's a lot of things like all thegames that I gotta have that you so freethat's cool that's another thing it'sjust like little things like that makeit a high quality and worth likeinvesting in and also I don't know ifyou guys me this the all the lemon stuffhas a lifetime guarantee so if anythinggoes wrong with it like you just bringit in and they replace it no questionsasked and they prefer you yeah Bellhaving like the bottoms of shirts orpants for free or the sleeves um so it'sjust you get what you pay for also thisis not like a sponsored video we're justobsessed because those are sponsoredvideos arereally popular and the oftentimes don'tknow which like if their opinions aregenuine or if they're getting paidforward but I definitely paid for all ofthis well this kind of goes into thewhole life they want she's that kind ofclose thing yeah I guess that's inexchange for at this can anyone comelose watching this I'll leave my emailyeah okay so oh I actually did get a lotof treats okay so the first one thefirst one doesn't really like becauseit's kind of like quirky but I like thefirst time I ever saw in a store whichwas probably months ago I was justreally drawn to it and I don't know whyI have no explanation like oh okay butit is called the perfectly first teamand this is on sale so that's why I likefinally bit the bullet and got itbut it's cactus print and stop makingthat face and it's just like a tailoredt-shirt but it's like kind of a three orfabric you guys can see and that hasthese little perforations so that makesit kind of exciting and those down theback as well and I don't know why I justreally think the cactus print is cuteand I know that's kind of like but Ienjoy it and it was on final sale for$49 they also have this print I'm like ahat I think yeah so I wouldn't reallywear this to the gym bud where like toclass with a library or something likethat oh I'm in all right so then surethe second style tank top this would belike more low-cut in the frontclassic gym bro yeah just like thetraditional material on these are sonice because they're likethicker but likes really breathable youcan see yeah but yeah they like thickand comfy but light and like yeah nothot like they feel substantial but notconstricting yeah those this is themetal vent tech tank and the other onewas okay so then I got three more likebasic Church which are all tanks this isthe what the sport to see but this iswhat it looks like it's black but thathas like gold threads all the waythrough itit's really low cut down the side it'sthe last Sabrina breathe you knowbecause it's really unflattering howgirls shirts are like cut high and thenmy lats hang over them and it just lookslike back fat so this one and then I gotthe same tank but in a different thesame style but in a different colorI believe yep what the sports singlet -and this one is just like a heathered itred and then the hands of these are likescoop and then they go up on the sidewhich I like because I kind of like thebunch of my chairs up at the top of myleggings and then just hang reallynicely and again I would rather have acouple of these that are really nicelong lasting then alright last one I gotthis one's my favorite now this one haslike a pocket in front and it's a littlebit more of cotton yeah cotton amaterial like old school still reallycomfortable see this is a so it's whiteand I'm the trim and the pocket are likea heathered Obiang color yeah it'scalled the sundownyeah all right cut slow like on the sideyeah so this one guys so can you explainlike why like yesterday you wore yourblue shirt instead of the white onebecause of like your activity so whatlike well for guys I mean we dependingon what you know muscle group working inthe gym like we're different kinds ofshirts open working chest one day I wantshirt that's like more love cut in thefront so I can see my chest I said we'regonna out yesterday as doing more of alike a leg circuit and so I was wearingto make the crewneck make more materialon it because I don't need to show thatmuch upper body kind of a thing yeah Iguess but I got one more shirt from theloop and it is this one called the coolracerback and this is more of just likethe traditional cut

hey guys today I'm going to be sharingwith you a few pieces of clothing I'vegotten for a little lemon actually I gotthis about a month or two ago and sincethen I've acquired a lot more but Ialready filmed the trimet portion ofthis video so what I'm only going toinclude a few of the items but if you'dlike to see everything else I got makesure to comment down below and let meknow put the hair back so it looks likei'm wearing clothes there we go so thefirst thing I'm showing you is thisjacket and the tag is sticking out andit is one of the defined jacket I'mobsessed with these jackets they bitimpeccably and they make you look sogood this is the i guess lightherringbone print it has little fumbleswhich I'm obsessed with it's summer nowso I'm not wearing it as often but Istill love it and I got a size 2 becauseI was sold out in a size 4 for referenceand all of the tops I am a size 2 cuzI'm a pretty petite up top but thebottoms I'm a size 4 because a littlebit bigger down there lets me roll sothe first tank top I got was this oneazam fits about getting this when I waslooking at online but it was like youknow what I like so just go ahead andget it I posted it in a snapchat if youguys follow me on snapchat you mighthave saw that all of my tanks have likea built-in bra because I hate wearingbras in the gym so I just come back seesyounext tank top I got is this one and I'mobsessed with this style i also got itin black which I'm showing you right nowbut I can't find it right now so um yeahyou're just going to see this littleclip of it anyhow so this is the mintone I have and it has this cool mesh I'mobsessed with again it has the built-inbra now thanks pretty cool and I lovewearing man the last little tank top Igot it doesn't have a built-in bra whichI'm kind of sad about but I bought thisto kind of run on the beach with I liveright side beach I really like all oflululemon sports bras and this one is noexception it is just a plain black onebut when you look at it back it has allthese little crisscross is in it and Ilike wearing this with tape tops withopen backs of course so you can see theawesome bra so the first pair ofleggings I got I honestly have no ideawhere they are but they are justlululemon signature wonder unders whichare fantastic leggings I wear them allthe time I hate leggings when you'rewearing them and they just get baggy andloosen the button everything littlelemons just hold you in tight and youdon't have to worry about that you canjust know that you look good and that'sall it matters if you've never boughtanything from Lublin for I woulddefinitely suggest to get just a plainblack pair of under wonders as yourfirst purchase you won't regret it sothe next parrot have to show you arethese Croft pair and they are a verycool pattern it's called the starcrushed coral I know that because I havelike four pairs of this specific printin different colors and styles but um Ireally like it the cool thing about thispair ishas this mesh detailing at the bottomand it goes across your leg and justlooks pretty awesome so now i have twopairs of roll down one renders to showyou the first pair is again start freshcoral this one is in black yeah theseactually can roll down which is kind ofcool always leave them wrap it up incase I ate a lot that day and I don'twant to show everybody how much of afood baby i have because it sucks you inthe next to last pair of leggings i haveto show you again are the roll-downwonder under style i don't know why i'mdemonstrating but these are snake printsand I just like wearing black to the gymso I got a lot of the variances of blackso i can wear it i don't know i reallylike them they again a fit impeccablyand i have no complaints so the lastpair of leggings i had to show you I wasreally hesitant about buying the onlyreason i bought these leggings isbecause i saw this picture on tumblr ofa girl wearing them and she looked sogood and i was just obsessed for thatpicture i also bought the sports bra shewas wearing which i showed earlier wheni saw the picture I figured it waslittle lemon so I went on the site andof course it was cuz i found the pantsthe first thing that comes to mind whenI think of Alexa wearing tight pants iswow what the stripes are gonna make melook like cow great my legs will lookeven bigger than they already areperfect but um I bought them anyways andthey actually don't look bad because ofthis placement of the stripes so you cansee how it kind of curves in and I triedto film this I don't know if the stripesare messing with the camera lens or justthe way your eyes areadd it on the computer screen but itlooks kind of weird these are more likea water working material whereas thenormal wonder Enders are a thickercotton and they have pockets like howcan you not love them they have likelittle pockets on the side I wouldrecommend those because if they don'tmake me look fat they won't make youlook fat let's just be honest now if youenjoyed

saybefore we get into this video if youmight want to see a little bit more ofme like the unrefined just don't carelike mMmmm like that kind of me youshould subscribe to our daily vlogchannel because on the daily vlogChannel ahyou see the side of me that you've neverseen before so if you want to seeeverything like whoa did she really justdo that kind of situation subscribe toour daily vlog channel the link is inthe description box alright enough ofthat let's get into this okay so I loveme some moolah lemon and I recently hitmy goal by weight loss goalpre-pregnancy weight so I figured as areward I would over myself with shoppingso let's show you what I got the firstthing that I got oh my gosh I set theseon the carpet and there's fuzz ballslike seriously all over themmmm I'm going to show you I'm gonna showyou some Lululemon with some fuzz ballsand I'm not sponsored by them but ifthey ever watch this video hey Lulutalk to me baby alright the first thingthat I got is Lululemon workout pantsand they are like the longest pants youwill ever see ever I will show you apicture of me wearing them they aresuper super long so actually have toroll them at the cuffs but they'refitted and skinny at the bottom and Ijust really like them a ton I get myLululemon's on eBay because they're likehalf the price and they're still soawesome and I love them because you geta brand new or like barely used likeworn onceand they're still in like amazingcondition another thing that I got arethese little lemons I think it's alsolike kind of dated I don't know if theyeven make this style because I haven'tseen like the top parts of the pans likethis in quite a while if you see if youlike follow me on Instagram you've seenme like post a couple belly shots likewith this belly shots what I readpregnant but anyways these are supersuper cute I love how tightI love these so much because when I dosquats it just feels so amazing theseare probably one of my favorite pairs ofpants that I got the next thing that Igot is actually the shirt that I amwearing right now I will show you whatit looks like this is honestly such afun sure I love it because it's likesuper super soft and so breathablesometimes though I have to admitsometimes I like having someone over I'mgoing out in public like I'm kind ofnervous to worry I don't know why it'sreally not that risque but because likemy sideshows I don't want someone to belike oh you're so raunchy my husband'swith me you know I don't know why I feelthat way but like sometimes I just likeput like zip up over cuz I'm like Idon't know so that is that one andhere's another top tank top that I gotand I really really like this one but Iprobably like the other one even moreI'm sorry that I don't really know thenames of these tops I'm really sorry I'ma really bad youtuber but anyways enoughof that let's get onto this top I reallylike this one but I probably like theother one better because it just makesyour cleavage looks amazing and thisone's really awesome too I really lovethe back of it the only thing I don'tlike I wore this in my cleaning routineif you guys want to see me like cleaningin this dang job or this one of mycleaning routine and the only thing itdid to me that I wasn't crazy about isit gave me this like a little likepocket like it will it will really coveryou up if you have like somethingforgiving areas that you really don'twant anybody to see it'll cover you uppretty goodbut it just like when you want someoneto see that like or you or you don'twant to look a little bit bigger and youhave like a really good tight tummy itkind of makes you balloon out when youlike bend over and stuff so that's theonly bad thing and it doesn't make yourboobs look like hella awesome it kind ofjust you know it just doesn't lookperfect but I really really like thatthe next thing I got no I should I showyou guys what I look like in these theseare like super tiny I'm like debating ifI I would ever wear these in public butthey're really really good for workingout I've got these like itty-bitty teenytiny holy crap is out underwear shortsand they're super cute and super softbut one of the things I lovepoor I love them for doing squats likethese are my best friend for squats andleg workouts oh my gosh because there'snothing like restricting my legs so itfeels amazing but one of the things I donot like it for is running Wow let'stalk about this for just one quicksecond so I can just kind of get it offone thing I don't like it for is runningbecause when you run like you if you'rerunning like at a fast pace if you'rerunning like slow I'm sure this I'm sureyou're good but if you're running fastlike holy-moly like that the inner partslike goes into your lady parts and it'sjust not really a fun experience so Igot those ones and then I actually gotanother pair because I thought they wereso hella awesome and these ones are thecutest pair ever oh my gosh I love theseshorts like because I love gray and thenI like things that compliment Greg so Ihave to get the fuzz balls off I gotthese ones too aren't those cute likeseriously so I might show you guys thepicture of what I look like in them butI mean like debate it mentally debatingabout it right now because wow you'regonna think I'm a huge F hoochie mama sothose are what those affect and like Isaid I was really I was like not evensure if I should buy them I was like manwhat am I gonna wear these out like inpublic or what but it's not to the pointwhere I just like got them and it wasjust like they felt so amazing therewere so much better because before I waswearing Nike Runner shorts the kind tokind of envelope and they kind ofballoon out when you run which are niceand all but I felt like when I wasaround the house I kind of felt a littlebit frumpy wearing them and it wasn'tcrazy about that so I wanted something alittle bit different a little bit morehoochie mama my husband loved them somuch that he's requested that I buy likefive more pairs so I know that'sprobably like way too much informationbut your man might like oh another thingthat I got and honestly I'm gonna bereal with you I don't even know if Ilike this purchase the second I got themI was like man I should return these butI'm actually gonna keep them justbecause I feel like I can find some usefor them and I could wear them I don'tknow I just the only reason I don't likethem so this is what they look likethey're called city kickers I thinkand they have the cutest littleLululemon like a black thing in the backwhich I like that because usually it'sjust white and they're really cute and Ilove this pattern I don't know what thispattern is if you guys know let me knowin the comments below so I don't soundso um so incompetent in my videos butthe thing that I don't like about theseis they they're capris they're likelonger than capris and they balloon outinstead of like hugging your calf theykind of balloon out and it gives youmore of a bigger overall leg look andI'm just not crazy about it does do areally good job like high in your tummybut you'll see me wearing them but Ithink that pattern it was gorgeous andthat's one of the reasons why Ipurchased them because I just thoughtwow this is the prettiest pair ever andwhen Isis I have money base and momslike I get hesitant like did I get afake one or not cuz like I've heard thisbefore let me know in the comments belowif this is right or wrong but I've heardthat if you have like a number in thepocket and you're it's an authenticLululemon and these ones don't have anumber and then walk so I don't know ifthese are real or not alright guys andgive this video a thumbs up if you guyslike halt that is everything that Ipurchased and I wanted to put a littleclip in here at the end and kind of talkabout my juice cleanse cuz a lot ofpeople are asking about just cleanse andhow it wentso I kind of wanted to let you know Ididn't want to make a separate videoabout it because I was like there was aton to update you guys about but I didrecently break my juice box and I had anamazing experience because I mean Ijuiced for about thirty days and I hadso much fun doing it I didn't limitmyself I wasn't just drinking juiceevery now and then I would have nutsevery now and then I would have likesome healthy veggies in a bowl I kind ofspice it up and did whatever I wanted todo which was really really awesome andyesterday I actually broke my juice fastwhich was really just liberating I gotto have a healthy veggie stir-fry andI'm so good it's so good but the funnything was todayI'm like all excited that I'm off myjuice fast because I had been you knowcraving a certain foods and reallyexcited not that I'm gonna go have acheat day cuz I mean what would be thepurpose of the juice cleanse if I justgo and cheat it all back or you know getunhealthy again that's pointless butanyways I finally stopped she would singand then this morning I went back to thejuice bar the local juicer and I pickedup a lot more cheese cuz I was just likethis can't be over yet our relationshipscannot end yet so I'm still juicing andI'm having tons of fun if you guys don'teven know what I'm talking about I'llleave a link to that video withdescription box below but thank you guysso much for watching my video you guysare so awesome if there's any videos youwant to see leave them in the

theylook like I'm so excited it took meforever to finally pick out the pair Iwanted I had to like look through everysingle one and try I'm like literallyall of them but I found that I reallyjust got them for rowing because Ineeded a good pair of like rowingsunglasses when it's like really sunnywhen you were so used to just roll withthese kind of like crappy polarized onesand I like broke them all

thisthey're black and there's like so manydifferent names there's like radar radarlock and to like all these differentones sorry this is like boring if youlike don't even get but I don't knowit's like

stays on when you're movingaround when you're rowing and then I gotthe big lenses because I like thembigger so these are like Excel orsomething and they're just they're likepolarized black ones but the flacc 2.0didn't come with polarized lenses so Iactually had to buy the frame itself andthen just the polarized lenses but itlike worked out they're quite aninvestment because oakley's are kind

this time has been challengingand I don't really feel like I've everit's not that I've never struggled withpink week but I've never reallystruggled with the mental aspect it'susually like I'm hungry I can't wait toget more carbs added back in etc andthis week has been more mentallychallenging for me which is new so Ithought I'd share that with you guys andI think it's a number of reasons I amlike so beyond excited for this showthis will be the first time my parentsare coming to watch me which this willbe like my 10th competition so it's ahuge deal my parents are coming Jasonwill be there my sister's coming there'sgonna be people from the MTS militiathere there's gonna be local people likethere's so many people that are going tobe there so I'm just so excited and partof me also has that thing inside of mefeeling like I don't want to let anyonedownand I know everyone's gonna be like youdon't have that anyone down but whenyou're that person competing and allyour family's coming you know I do feelnot pressure to like impress them by anymeans I know they're proud of me andthey'll be happy regardless of how Iplace but like I really just want tolike you know I really want to own it upthere and I really just want to likeearn it you know and prove it and showeveryone and that freakin 8th place fromthat last competition just resonateresonates and meand it sucks it shouldn't but it doeslike it's just kind of in the back of mymind you got a place and that kind ofsucks and that was a competition withlike 75 competitors this competition isstacked it's a hundred and seventy fivecompetitors and you better believe Iguarantee a majority of them are bikiniso that in a way gets me a littlenervousI want there to be good competitionthere's gonna be because so many peoplehave already reached out to me oversocial media and said oh my god I'mcompeting at the same show as you so Iknow it's gonna be a huge show which isawesome the only thing that concerns meis I feel like when classes get largerthan I don't know I think like fifteento twenty girls is good I think when youget higher than that per hype classgirls tend to get lost in the mix andeveryone looks good so it's kind of hardto stand out so don't get me wrong um Ifeel like I do stand out I feel likeI've got a little something specialinside of me that captures the judgeseye you kind of have to have that to beon the stage but at the same time like Idon't want to get lost up there and hopeno one else gets lost up there we've allworked so hard we want to have our timeto shine we all want the judges to lookat us fairly and have enough time tolook at us as a group so I hope if it'sthat big that they separate the highclasses in a good way so yeah that'swhere I'm at I am like tired I look likeI told my husband an old man's scrotumthis describe myself I just feel likeI'm looking a little a little peak weekHaggerty so um that's my update two daysout feeling feeling probably how Ishould at this point and I want it toalso in conjunction with this video dolittle on packaging for you I got alittle lemonin the mail I already opened em I canlie I couldn't not open it when I gothome I was super excited so I'm going toshow you guys what I got and I also wentand did part of competing and OCB is youhave to have a polygraph test done so Ihad to go there today I just did fortraining it was later I did shoulders 20minutes of just like low steady-statecardio and then I went and got mypolygraph done which I was nervous forlike anyone else get that I'm like I'mgood but yeah I'm super nervous rightnow so that's great hopefully I passedit past my Lululemon package actuallyexhale I got three things which onlythrough things that Lulu them and costlike $300 so don't get me wrong it's notcheap but I wanted to show you realquick I haven't tried any of it on yetbut this is the swiftly tech crew I havea couple of these shirts and I reallyliked the pattern on it I like that it'slike a plum color and it kind of getsdarker on the bottom I thought that waspretty cool I love the comfort of theseshirts sometimes I wear them to trainand then sometimes I just like to wearthem I usually do get a size four in thelemon sometimes I can do it too up topbut I typically go with sites or just togive me a little more room and then Igot these are like a I forgot what colorthey are in Lululemon terms but they'relike a burgundy or cranberry color croppant they are the zoning crop I likethese because there's a seamless so youdon't get the giant camel toe whichhappens in Lululemon pants it reallydoes and it sucks but they look solittle but they stretch out with time mybig butt will fit in therelove the material of those and then Ialready have one of these but I wantedanother one so I love it so much this isthe scuba hoodie the scuba hoodie - Idon't know the difference between thatand the one and this is just therethey're all black one these are awesomebecause they're super thick and likedurable just super super comfortable sothose are my three little fun finds atLululemon that I got this week so thatmade me happy that was fun to come hometo and one of the nice things about OCbe like they go all out for theircompetitors at least well I've onlycompeted in one show which is the samepromoter as this show might cause II andhe does an awesome job at like he reallythinks about the competitors and keepsthem in mind for the show which i thinkdoes stand out to me because I can'tthink of any other shows I've competedin that really do that for theircompetitors so he gets a crap ton ofsamples from people and like hooks us upwith like goodie bags and stuff youreally don't get that kind of stuff thatlike other shows but I just think that'sreally cool so so you get a competitort-shirt which i think is pretty coolit's a size small it's big but it's coolyou get that Mike actually has asupplement shop in Syracuse and sells aton of MTS nutrition that I found outtoday he has a crap ton of it there healso sells his own clothing line calledAB free and I got a peak week let's dothis tank top so that's pretty nice gotthat I got my competitor numberI'm 113 you guys be rooting for me 113yeah

yes I wanted to do a haul video oh mygod a lot of cute stuff lately and Iwanted to show you guys Sochi becausemost of it was actually a really gooddeal I guess I'll start with this stuffthat's like not such a good deal thoughthe first two things I got wereLululemon tank tops now I'm a pretty bigfan of Willam I just think they makeyour butt look so cute and they arefairly durable even though I havenoticed the quality is not as good as aweight but anyway so I got two tank topsso this one is I think the power Y tanktop has a little racer back like thiswe don't do a lemon logo on the backshelf bra in the front so that's nicenot to wear a sports bra with it so thisone I maybe didn't like so much I waskind of surprised as I tend to like alot of like Razorback stuff and I likethin straps but I feel like this tanktop in particular this style is notreally flattering on my body because onething about having a larger but whateveryou get you kind of deposit fat or youjust like are more meteor right on topof like your back hip bones um and Ifeel like this really emphasizes thatlike it squeezes it in a really uglyweight it just is really not flatteringso I probably would recommend this toother people who kind of like how like asimilar body type to me more pair ofshape if you're a heavy on the bottomjust because for some reason this makesyou look just like really bad on thebottom so I didn't really like that somuch the next one Cox I got a deal onthis tank top in particular was a redrazor back to top now this is the coolI think it's called a cool Razorback noI actually really like this tank top Iused to have a size 2 in it until thatgirl stole my stuff and so now I don'thave it anymore so I got two on it butthat sale was kind of liketime-sensitive so I just got a size fourcuz that was all they had in store atthe time and the girls are like oh no nodon't worry it'll fit it'll fit eventhough it's a size 4 and does not fitdon't believe that because the chestgoes down to like right here like areally uncomfortably low much lower thanyour sports bra and so it just looksweird look like a bar like yourboyfriend's take top or something Ireally love these if you get them in theright size but I'm probably gonna beblog selling this because I wore it liketwice oh my god it surely doesn't fit itmakes me look ridiculous so you know itwould make it work for you if you'relike much heavier up top than I am butI'm obviously not too heavy up top so itlooks stupid well the next thing Iactually read like this somy friends came from North Cal the otherday and they wanted to go clubbing forwhatever reason so we went and I didn'thave any dresses right and I had out ofthe clubbing scene for so long so I hitup all my favorite websites hit up allmy favorite stores and I feel like noone makes cute dresses anymore I don'tunderstand why yeah it's a really hardtime I probably search for like a monthand a half before cuz I knew that theywere coming down and so I was like Ican't well I guess I'm gonna wear skirtso I went to forever21 because I'veobviously but the best place to getskirts I think and then I found thisreally cute red one looks like a littlered miniskirt a little bit longer thanthe miniskirt though and it has a prettygold zipper on the back I love the goldzipper I don't know why and the guys cansee the texture it's like this ruffledtexture so I really love this skirt andit was only ten dollars or something soit's such a good deal very flatteringreally cute short but not like too shortand so I really like it cute and sexybut seriously where are all the cuteclubbing dresses these days I don'tunderstand why it's so hard to make likea cute small dress so anyways I told youguys I have been like super obsessedwith Marshalls just because they have alot of really good shoes I don't know ifyou guys know you know I alwayscompliment my friend shoes it's likedude I get them all at Marshall's andyou know they sell guest ones they sellBVB just all the time they don't reallylike have ones that are like superfashionable but then once a while theydo so it's worth popping it I lovepopping into their shoe section and Ilove popping into their like homeworksection lot of you guys ask me where Igot my little containers where they likekeep food and stuff back when I was incollege and that was where you guys canget one really cute nice Tupperwaretherefore much cheaper you guys are intotough where I love to pour this kind ofthing that came page so I got theseshoes no I know what brand this is mangobut it was actually pretty cute I thinkthere are only $25 look at them prettycute huhso I like them up closest like I saidthey're not actually like super cheaplymade but the only problem I could say Ihave with these shoes in particular islike this little part right here it'sslightly uncomfortable when I walksometimes they'll like dig into my skinit doesn't feel that good I think if Iput like a pad right here it would fixthat so I don't need to buy a bunch ofthose little pads but it's a littlestiff right here this little opening andso it just kind of hurts sometimes whenI wear them for a long time and theshank is actually a little bit stiff aswell so I mean it's slightlyuncomfortable but I still like they'rereally cute and they do like I saidI guess shoes and so I saw this hangingwhen I was walking past I don't know ifthey do this on purpose if they likechoose ones that hey stick out but I sawthis sticking out and I was like oh thisis cute and I was wearing this in mylast video so it's just a you know likeone of those sheer blouse is nothingspecial right just a cream one gatheredsleeves right here basically just acream sheer shirt this was like supersheer but I think it's still cute and itwas only twelve dollars or something sosuper cute so recently it was theBloomingdale's sale and so I got a bunchof stuff on Bloomingdale's and this wasactually a thing from last season butit's just like flip-flops so it's thebig deal so I got these Torrey bridgeflip-flops um I have the hard ones likethe hard plastic ones that are like 135or whatever but they're reallyuncomfortable like I really don't likethem I like how they look I hate howthey feel and they were just so hard tobreak in they were giving me like backproblems that was crazyso I got these foam ones instead andthey were on sale for maybe $30 thathouse like a little silver logo rightthere I wish that they would not havelike these designs on the bond theywould just have like some kind of clearsolid color all the way through but ohwell they're statues so this is kind ofhow I think all of their phoneflip-flops go so these are a really gooddeal I really like these very cutewaiting for summer to come around so Ican whip them out and the next things Igot were from yes style so I got thislittle gray sweater and so I was tryingto get a bunch of their clothing justbecause I'm sure you guys already knowwho Sylvia is the Sylvia Beauty cakesslash beauty cakes so she always findsreally cute clothes from yesterday I waslike dude how do you even have energy toflip through the thousands of page allthe clothing that they have cuz theyreally have so much clothing on thereand it's just like once you figure outlike what brands you like then you'llfind ones that are really cute so youjust have to figure out what brands likeso I figured out that I would be likepuffy I really like pokeo fashion andthere's like one other one I can't thinkabout the top my head and so I ended uppretty much just getting stuff fromthose brands and those brands seems tokind of like suit my style a bit more soI got this sweater and everything I gotfrom rest I think was that the most like2025 dollars everything was pretty cheapand so they had a big sale recently sothis gray off-the-shoulder sweater Iknow you guys tend to likeoff-the-shoulder stuff it's a little bitthicker I like the exact like actualsweater material you know a lot of myoff-the-shoulder sweaters they're justkind of like long-sleeve shirt materialbut this one's a lot thicker so Iactually kind of like thatI also got this little leopard scarf Idon't know why I got this I just thoughtwas cute so it's like super long andthick but they had it when they had onthe modelit's like much thinner just like whereoh no it looks super comfy and warm it'slike oh it's so cute I think is onlydoesn't watch lychee waiting because itwas like 15 bucks oh no I'm gonna haveall the prices down the description boxbecause I can't remember all them offthe top my head and then I also got abunch of accessories from them so I gotthis little big collar necklace Irealize each style and so central thosetwo brands makes a lot of cute jewelryso I got this little bit necklace justgonna see pretty typical right feel likea lot of people mix up like this now soI got this and I also got two necklacesfrom each style this one was like a longchain I really wanted long necklaceslike where am I kind of have once when Ihave a really not so flattering boatnext top on then I could have a longerchain necklace and that would make itlook kind of better so this was one ofthem this is probably white morefavorite one of the two and has likelittle circles you guys know I kind oflike that kind of design okay I haveanother one that I got and this is theone I probably didn't like as much Ilike the pendant like I like how thependant looks I like a dependent looksbut I don't really like the chains it'slike this little ball chain and I feellike it looks come cheap together I wishthey had done like a nice little goldchain like how they did on this one Ithink this one that chains much betterso I don't maybe don't like this goldbeaded chain as much but then the lastthing I got from YesStyle cute littleshoes they're kind of crazy but Ithought that they would look really cutewith skinny jeans it's like leatherstrap it has all these buckles so prettycrazy but I just wanted some cute shoesto go with like skinny jeans and I waswearing a really casual and it may belike obviously top skinny jeans I thinkthis would give it a little bit moreedge and edgier and this was actuallyfit really well sometimes like I said Ireally struggle with yes style clothingand shoes but these ones actually fitreally well I was surprised very sexyreally cute pretty well made you knowbecause I did have some problems withsome of the other brands I tried so I'mnot sure which brand this isis probably in Korean and it totally isbut I'll give you guys links now thedescription box you guys are interestedbut this one was the one that appliedmost success today this was maybe like$40 or the last thing my nail polishthis is OPI so ski till we dropskates your job kind of a darker morewinter appropriate nail polish it'sreally opaque with in one coat it wasalmost opaque like 90% paper so so youstill want to do like two coats but itwas really pretty I really like I didn'tthink I would like it but super gorgeousso anyways that is my haul I hope youguys enjoy probably my favorite thingjust because it was such a good deal andits really cute is this skirt butforever to me one one I loved itso cute okay

we investigated amazon dupes versusdesigner pieces i don't think they feelthe same at allyou guys this is like the exact sameshoe in my opinionthey're equally as ugly dupe approvedyou guys welcome back to clever styleall right you guys know how we do onthis channel we lovefashion and more importantly we love toinvestigatewe investigated amazon dupes versusdesigner pieces now if you guys don'tknow what a dupe is it's basicallya less expensive versionof a very expensive item we're going tobe comparingthe dupe with the real thing to let youguys know if it is a dupeor if it is a dud we're gonna be lookingat the similarities the color the priceall the things to be our investigativeselves and let you know if you shouldbuy it or not and our items are comingfrom three different categories today wehave affordablea splurge and a luxury category and weactually reallygot uh like a 3 000 purse and it was alot i felt a lot of pressure that day iwas like harrisonsix feet away dude[Music]we are going to be investigating thebirkenstockslide on so there was a tick tock userbrooklyn who kind of put us onto these birkenstock dupes i got somefake birkenstocksthis is what they look like on feet theamazon shoes are only15 where the birkenstock shoes are 45so just holding them up next to eachother before you even put them on theyare pretty similari still feel like the amazon one clearlylooks cheaperbut if you're thinking about how cheapthe actual birkenstock isthen i don't really see that big of adifference so i'm just gonna reallyquickly show you guys what a birkenstocklooks likethey are so they literally are like idon't know what to compare them to rightnow i'm blanking on everything in theworldclouds i actually feellike the dupe is a little more sturdyand these are a little softer which maymake these more comfortablebut as far as holding up over time idon't knowsomething actually tells me these havemore structure and they might actuallylast a bit longer in my opinion they'reequally as ugly so it's really hard forme i'm like literallyone is like cheap foam and the other oneis likecheaper foam you guys this is like theexact same shoethe only difference is like one saysbirkenstock i swearthis has a bit more like interestingdesign when it comes to the clasp butlike if anyone's looking that close atyour feetthey should pay you for that all rightthese are them side by side can you tellwhich one is the birkenstock and whichone is the amazon no not really but ithink if you turn them to the sidethat's where you start to see even if itdidn't say birkenstock right there ithink you could be able to tell thatthisand this is a lot more expensive thanthisthis looks like um like a pool shoe theyboth are hideoussince the girl who literally owns a pairof these like i can never make theselook goodso that is one of the reasons why i didnot want to spend a ton of money and iwanted to get more of the affordableroutei'm like already and way more into thethe knock off if you're somebody whojustprefers to support the actual brand itotally understand that if you'resomeone like me who doesn't umthen the amazon is probably going to beyour best bet so do i think it's worthitno i would not spend 45 on birkenstocksi just don't know how this is great foryour footit's foam this is not a shoe it's a poolnoodle i think my biggest takeaway isthat they both feelso similar that like this would not belike a worth it purchase because you'renot going to be able to tell so i wouldsay get the dupe 15vs 45 that's not bad i'm gonna say thattheseamazon shoes are a solid dupedupe approved[Music]all right up next on our dupe vs dudchallenge we are going to be raidingthe lululemon align leggings in this funcamo print and then tick tock did itagain they found a fun little dupethis one was actually discovered byhannah ray dancer whofound these on amazon i don't think theyfeel the sameat all this pair that i'm feeling issofter it's lighter it's thinnerthis pair that i'm feeling it's soft butit'sthicker it actually feels like it couldhold you in a little bit better it's alittle stronger of a material all rightso these are the lululemon leggings these are incrediblycomfortablei can't even believe how thin they are iwould work out in theseevery day all day but i would neverspend moneyon lululemon leggings expensive doesn'talways mean better thoughthese are the lululemon align leggingsthese ones are98 they're very cute like ilike them they fit well they're notdoing much to like suck me in oranything like that but i'vebought lululemon leggings before so ikind of know what to expect i have to be100 honest and tell you that these mightbeone of the most comfortable pairs ofleggings i've ever put on and they'reincredibly flatteringand i want my butt like to look likethis all the time becky lookat her butt this is a really hard onefor me because i actuallythink these feel like a really greatpair of workout pants there's nothingbad about themand i actually feel like they may evenbebetter for people who like a little morethicker coveragein the bum region over time thinnerpants can stretch outthese fit so similarly like the onlydifference i would say is that they're alittle bit darker in color than thelulu ones are the lulu ones are verylike light army green and have that camoprint this one's just a little bitdarkerthey're definitely like that kind ofsimilar texture the waistis similar maybe even like a little bitof a thicker band andthe butt kind of does like a bit of atriangle here i meanyou are getting a very similar pant andyou're getting pockets likewe love a pocket oh my god[Laughter]for me personally i'm very particularand i don't like thisi think these are just cuter they'renicer and they definitely look moreexpensive and they feel incredible so ifyou want a good pair of leggings for 30bucksthen yeah i would definitely recommendthese i just don't think you should getthese thinking they're like thesebecause you canjust looking at them you can tellthey're not if you want to have alululemon experienceon a amazon budget these pants aredefinitely where it's atguys i'm gonna give these a dupe ratingnot a dudeven just on their own like they do areally good job if you guys can tellthese ones are a little lighter theseones are darker but all in all likethat's kind of the main difference theydefinitely fit the exact same in termsof like sucking you inand they have like a nice buttery feelso good job amazonwhat's next[Music]on to the luxury category this one isreal luxury like i didn't even know wehad enough money to buy this bag luxurythat's how luxury it isso we pulled out a google search andfound amanda in the gray details blogwho claims that this 70 amazonpouch bag is a dupe for this 3000 bottega vanetta pouch oh my god iliterallyhate having this right now because whatif i get makeup on it likei just i can't this is super cutevery spacious like i could fit a verysmall los angeles dog in herewhen it comes to purses it takes a lotto like really make mewant them and a pouch bag is like myleast favorite kind ofpurse because there's no handles andthen you have to hold it all night andi'm lazyi'm not the purse girl so to me i'm likethey both look great so you would paythree thousand dollars fora designer bag that you have to put yourmakeup bedirty hands on and carryaround no i would nevernever never never how do you even holdthis bag i guess you just kind of likehold it hello here's my bag i guess ohokay it's one of these bags oh my godi don't want to like get deodorant oni'm so stressed but honestly justlooking at ityes i think that these are extremelysimilar i still feel like the 3000 pouch is obviously higher qualitythan the 70one but again i hate to be a debbiedowner but i wouldn't even pay seventydollars for a pursei haven't worn purse since like 2012.this iscrazy this is legitimately almostidentical clearly they were actuallytrying to dupe this this wasn't likesomebody found an accidental dupe i donot seehow this wasn't 100 intentional theinside is very similar like a black holevibes comes with um straps the other onedid not come with straps but maybethat's like you don't want strapsbecause then it like gives it away thatit's fakeso i feel like looking at them you canstill see that the bottega venetta pouchbagis more expensive it just like has a lotmore detailand like i'm pretty sure it's like realleather right this one doesn't look thesamei mean can you guys really tell thedifference side by sidemaybe but if i put this one up and theni put this one up you really wouldn't beable to tellthis is my thing if you want to pay morefor the bag like you want the logo to beshowing and this one youlike there's no logo so i mean why youdid this for whati just think it's a black pouch likewhat are you expectingto open it and like mary poppins comesout you want a black pouch you'regetting a black pouch one is just 70and the other one's 3 000. and i thinkit's a pretty damn good dupe i'm notgonna liei absolutely hands down 100think this is a perfect dupe if you'vebeen eyeing this bagunless you have bougier taste than i dowhich might be the case but if you'rejust like a normaljane like me you know anything aboutdesigner thingsyou'll never know the difference isthere anything you guys want us to finddupes up let us know in the commentsbelow we love doing some

next place I went to was UrbanOutfitters and I finally got the pinkbag I've been wanting this bag for solong and it's so stupid because itliterally looks like a potato sack[Music]hey guys it's Zoe and welcome back to mychannel so for today's video I have aspring the haul for you guys well it'sreally just a haulI mean it's spring but like so I've donequite a lot of shoppingwell I always do quite a lot of shoppingbut recently I've been shopping a littletoo much so I figured why not do a haulfor you guys okay so here we go just alittle disclaimer I'm not trying to bragin any way no but I'm really not tryingto brag I just have to say that and sohere's the thing that God let's all lookthem so the first place I went to wasPacSun and I never buy anything fromPath 7 ever but I went to outlets inCamarillo and they were having sales soI had to get stuff they were having likea buy one get two thing from theclearance thing or whatever it's calledso everything oh my god okay so thefirst thing I got from pack set is thiscropped um you see it it's a black shirtand it has a little Crossy thingies hereand it's three-quarter length sleevessuper cute I'm pretty sure it's from thebrandy Melville section although itdoesn't say it just says one size so I'massuming it's from brandy but the nextthing I bought from there was just asuper cute t-shirt and it's not a supercute t-shirt it's a t-shirt but I justreally like the color and I got it in asize too big because they didn't have mysize so I have to get it a size above soit'll look cute if I tie it and it'sreally nice mint green color and it haslike foldy things on the sideand the last thing I got from PacSun atthis bralette it's a really cute colorI've been actually really like to useblue color recently it just it's just abra and it has two strappy things butit's a little big on me so I have tolike tie it somehow I'm not having to dothat but next least I want to wasforever 21 and I got quite a few thingsfrom there because recently Trevor 21has been really good like I don't knowlike sometimes they're like really badand I never find anything there and likerecently like they're doing great solet's see what I got so the first thingI got was this again croppedthree-quarter length shirt it looksreally plain in the front but in theback it's as a cross crisscrossdetailing and it's really cute nice arose color and I'm pretty sure I worethis in the video things girls do whenthey're humble out and so okay nextthing I got was a bodysuit and I didn'town a bodysuit until like recentlybecause I just bought it at home umanyway so it's just this light pinkbodysuit it suits down in the back andit's really cute I have I worn it beforeI think I've worn it once I don't reallyknow how to wear body suits because Iwear leggings most of the times and Ifeel like it might look weird withleggings like Dora jeans but I only haveone pair of jeans wrong storyso let me know if you think I shouldwear this with something else sirso the next thing I got was this croppedtank top from forever 21 because I justI'm showing you the things I got forepisode on okay um and I really like itI don't really have anything like thiswell I have tank tops but none of themaren't cropped and none of them arepurple so this is really cute with thejean jackets I'm Lauren pork and Ireally like it next thing I got wassimilar to that one because I actuallygot it on the same day you know it'sfeeling really crop tank top vibes so Igot this one um this is not something Iwould normally wear at all in fact Idon't really like orange in yellow andred together but I think it's reallycute it's different it's also straightright here so there's no like swoop oranything it just goes straight acrossand I like it and again this would lookreally cute with a denim jacket or jeans[Music]next thing I got with another tank topbut this is a little more fancy I guessI guess I could dress this up just cuzof the material but it's this green pinktop and I think it's cute I have likethat like a sweet sweet like a tanjacket I can wear it with and I think itwould look really nice next place I wentto was Lululemon and I'm very excitedabout this um no I did not get anotherpair of leggings even though I reallywant more Lulu leggingsthey're really nice and I'm reallycomfortable so let me know if you wantto get me sound I'm just kiddingso from Lulu I got a headband they gaveme a huge bag for a headband so okay Iactually went to get this in black and Istill want it in black but I saw thisone and I really liked it it's like aindigo indigo blue color it reallybrings out my eyesoh talking to cameras really fun Ireally got a great response back nextplace I went to was Urban Outfitters andI finally got the pink back I've beenwanting this bag for so long and it's sostupid because it literally looks like apotato sack but the other bags I thinkthey used to be like black or somethingbut I really like pink and it's reallycute and I'm saying so from here I gotto bra less the first one being able tosee white one you know so it's just itlooks like this I have a bra left fromhere that is a halter top and I'm not abig fan of halter top so I got it in adifferent style that is not a halter andI'm taking it I like it moving on tonext throw away next one I got is thisand okay this looks so weird it doesn'teven look like a bralette it looks likea like a tank top that they cut tooshortand like I don't know it it's I got itit was on sale and I liked it and Ithink I'm gonna get use out of itbecause if there's an open back shirtthis covers your bra and makes it looknicer than a bra strap that's me tryingto justify wife watch shopping okay alsofrom Urban Outfitters I got two thingsfrom Mario Badescu finally I've beenwanting these for so long I got the rosewater spray and the drying lotion Ireally like both of these I ought tofeel like I spray this all the time sohow are freshI Spit this too often and also that thisI'm still trying to figure out if itworks 100% I'll let you guys know I'llkeep you up so this is just forhydrating but this is supposed to belike the twisted dry off your sis andKylie Jenner recommended it so obviouslyI had to get it cuz obviously worksright so 11 next weeks I went to wascotton on and from here I just got at-shirt but I have a story behind thist-shirt so I went to cotton on right Iwas looking and I was looking and therewasn't anything that I was like wowthat's cute and so I was like I can findanything basically so I was looking atthe sable relics and I saw this t-shirtand I was like oh this color is so cutebut like it wrinkles so much whatever soI was just trying a bunch of stuff onand then I looked at the price for thist-shirt if you can guess how much it wascalming it right now I'll give you sometime in the meantime look how cute it isit's just a green t-shirt okay no moretime to comment this was three dollarsso I think this would be super cutewithout white bra let I showed you somejeans and tied up thank youI like it so effort okay honestly I hatelong t-shirts because what's the pointlike it just goes over your butt and itfeels like weird so I think I can tie itand it's super soft so three dollart-shirt but by the way when I goshopping I usually walk into the storeand go straight to the sale rack becauseyou do not know what you can find in thesale rack and I've got a three dollart-shirt so you know then I work my wayup to like the price your stuff in frontbutthere's nothing wrong see I rock okayeven the brats from Urban Outfitters Ishowed we're from the sale rocks nowcome at me next I said my to you waspinkare you shocked cuz I am um yeah Iwonder what I got from here is the gotanywhere but I'm not going to show youthat um but really what I wanted to showyou is this little body spray it smellsreally good and it's in the scent wildat heart and by the way I was packing upall my stuff like in my shelves becauselike I said I'm moving um I found somany bags from

hey what's up everyone so yes I have notposted a video on this channel and wellover six months and I know at thebeginning of the year I promised that Iwould be posting more frequently on thischannel but obviously that did nothappen but this time I really do promisethat I'm going to be posting morefrequently on this channel I kind ofjust forgot how much I really do lovefilming videos but I'm getting back intothe swing of things and for my firstlike welcome back to my channel video Ithought it would be fun to post a veryhighly requested video and that is myupdated Lululemon collection video a lotof people have been asking me to film anupdated one ever since I posted my lastone which I think was over a year and ahalf ago so yeah that's what this videois going to be today I'm going to try tokeep it as short as I possibly can butit is a collection video so I have quitea few pieces that I want to go throughand I want to share my opinions andthoughts on them and as some of you havementioned in the comments below I liketo talk a lot so sorry about thatso let's get started I'm gonna start offwith leggings because I feel like if youare new to the Lululemon brand ingeneral leggings are kind of a reallygreat place to start because leggings atLululemon I feel like is where the branditself excels above all the other brandsLululemon is obviously a lot moreexpensive kind of than other workoutbrands but I feel like the price reallyjustifies itself you good quality itsdurability and the way it looks andfeels on my body when I wear it and if Iespecially goes towards pants and theleggings in general so the firstleggings I have to show you probably themost basic leggings that you canpossibly purchase from Lululemon andit's just the fold or it is the Wonderunderpantsand they are just basic black full likeleggings pretty much every brand hastheir own type of version of these andthis is justwoman's version it has a littleLululemon logo on the back and it has asmall hidden pocket on the waistband andagain their full-length these are fine Ireally did like these when I firstbought them but after buying this pairwhich this is the wonder under full onluan so they're a little bit differentthan just the regular version they'redifferent in that it's the full luanwhich means that the material itself isdifferent so instead of being a lot morespandexy feeling which is how theoriginal ones feel these ones have a lotmore of a cottony soft feeling which Ireally do prefer it's a lot morebreathable and a lot more stretchableand it's a lot more soft on your skinwhen you wear it however the only thingthat I have to say about the full luanones is that they have beat it up a lotand I take really good care of myLululemon because it's expensive andthey have kind of a special washinginstruction where you're not supposed toput them in the dryer and I don't putthese in the dryer and they really beatit up like the fabric is beat it up andit's just gotten really plenty and I'mnot really sure why because none of myother leggings have ever done this and Idon't really have a problem with chafingso yeah but I have worn the heck out ofthese the entire like december and coldseasons of the year i am living in thesepants so i've got a lot of wear of themi will be repurchasing them they are oneof my favorite leggings but it does kindof suck that the quality of theseparticular ones is kind of diminishing alot faster than some of my other pantsand the wonder under pant full on luanis a two to $19 I believe that these areeighty two dollars because they're blackand then these are 82 dollars as well ifI didn't mention for it I don't think Idid I have a size two or four inleggings and in jeans or just regularpant sizes I tend to be a 25 or 26 sothat's that and then again the wonderunder full luan I have the this colorit's against full length but it is aheadergrade like sweater material which iskind of fun and differenthonestly the spandexy ones are greatthey're totally fine they're normal butI don't really see a difference inbetween the regular Lululemon wonderUnderpants and your basic like Nikeleggings if you are going to go ondirection of buying a full-length basiclegging I would go in the direction ofthe full-on the one because I really dohighly recommend those and then the samewonder under lying I guess and LululemonI have the cropped version but they arereversible so you could also wear theminside out on the pink side which isreally fun I tend to wear them just onthe black side but the fun thing aboutthese is because it is reversible topink the stitching itself is pink whichis really cute and then when you walk inthese eisah fabric moves it's kind ofthe pink kind of picks through thefabric which is really cute I don'treally like to wear these working out inbecause again it's too thick of amaterial but I really love thembasically every day if I'm wearingcasual wear so I'll wear them to classI'm gonna run errands in so I do that alot of you said of them but it is kindof too thick of a fabric and I don'tlike that feeling when I work out but mynext pair of leggings I have to show youare absolutely amazing if you were tobuy only one pair of leggings fromLululemon or pair pants ever basically Iwould recommend these and these are thelet me find it on my phone these are theinspire tights to mesh and they retailfor 92 dollars or a hundred and twodollars I think if you get a fancierdesign but I just have the basic blackcolor these are amazing so there arecropped pants they go kind of longerthan your average crop so I would say itgoes a few inches above like my shins ormy feet or whatever not my shins my feetand ankles so it is longer crop which Ilike these are so incredibly comfortablethey honestly feel like you're wearing asecond layer of skin or you're runningjust butt-ass naked they are absolutelyamazing I cannot stress you enough howmuch you need these pants if you'rewilling to shell out the money for thembecause they're so worth it they are soincredibly comfortablethe material is so lightweight andbreathable that it's just absolutelyso you can sweat the hell out of it andit won't get absolutely disgustingbecause it is so sweat absorbent andsuch as their material and again themesh behind your kneecaps is absolutelyamazing because it just provides thatextra way to get more airflow when youare sweating and working out it has thezip pocket in the back of the waistbandwhich is really nice so and I wear theseto go running it in I can just put mykeys in the pocket which is great andthen it also has a smaller pocket in thewaistband as most little Evan ladies doand they also have a drawstring if youwant to take advantage of thatfunctional functional bility capabilityfavorite favorite favorite piece ofclothing I have ever owned fromLululemon and that is saying a lotbecause I feel like I own quite a widevariety of things from Lululemonthere are different versions of theinspire tight these particular ones arethe run inspired crop to all full-onluxe stream and the are current theseare currently on sale actually onlinefrom $96 to $69 and this is what theylook like they are just a really cooldesign they have like gray scales onthem like fish scales and it's reallycool again it has the same pocket so thesame zipped pocket in the back in thepocket and the waistband and these arereally nice as well however I will saybecause they do not have the match likethe red inspire crop to max version likeI just showed you that I'm in love withthey are not as comfortable to work outand they're not as stretchy which iskind of strange I think it's because ofthey'd like the luxe dream not reallysure what that means in Lululemonlanguage but for me it just means thatit's not as stretchy and it's not asit's just not it's comfortable to wearwhen you're working out and so I don'tprefer to wear these working out in butyeah those are those I have another pairof inspired tights these are kind of thesame ones as webstream but these aren'tthe luxe dream ones so they're just thebasic legging material but without themesh these are really cute they havelikeand black small stripes running throughthem which you probably can't see andthey have a really cute like ping seetailing and then my last pair ofleggings I have our on sale as wellright now online and these are calledthe seamlessly Street crop and they'reon sale from $88 to $54 they are verythick legging and I think these areaimed for like yoga people and I'm notreally so into yoga I kind of just wearthese again go out to class in but theyare comfortable because they're seamlessthey are just a really comfortable fitbut they are really thick which isn't myfavorite thing moving on to shorts Ihave kind of a different opinion onshorts I feel whereas the leggingsreally do kind of justify the price andthe quality and the way they fit andfeel on my bodythe shorts I Friday that little lemonare just really not that special I onlyown two of them and I really never wearthemI have this pair and I couldn't find anyinformation of these online um but I'msure you could find them in stores ifyou looked they're all I always see themthere they just have a zipped pocket andthen they came with a little likeunderwear lining which I don't reallylike so I cut that out I believe theseare about 50 for $60 so they're kind ofexpensive for just basic running shortsand honestly they fit really awkward Idon't know if you can tell but like whenyou wear it the waistband hugs your bodyand then all this excess fabric justkind of like poof out so kind of suckyour weariness score it we're justincredibly strange maybe it was for somepeople but on my particular body no itdoesn't do I think it's worth the priceno probably I would pass on those andthen I have another pair of shorts theseare just black and they have a built inlike legging spandex lining which I'vecuts in there I might cut it out Ihaven't really decided but I really justdon't wear these ever basically it alsohas a drawstring this one does not haveany pockets but I do like these onesmore than the lavender ones I justshowed because they fit just a littlebit better the material is a lot morelightweight and kind of like more ofyour average like running short materialthe lavender ones are more of a stiffmaterial which I really just don't likethese are cute but again I kind ofprefer my Nike running ones that you canbuy pretty much anywhere over these onesso though shorts from Lululemon aren'treally that amazing that I feel like youprobably could easily pass on those andthen a few accessories I have to show Ihave three sports bras and they are allthe same sports bras these are calledthe energy bra and I have in pink andthen I have two and black because I weara black most often except for this onehas a few like inspirational sayings ifyou can see them up really close but youprobably can't see right now but theback of these are really cute so whenyou're wearing like your racerback tanktops the straps kind of peek throughwhich is a really cute detailing I havekind of a fuller bust and I do need moresupport and on line it says this ismedium support I would agree with thatum depending on the size you get if youget kind of a smaller size obviously youcan get more of a support albumI like to wear these bras when I am I goto the gym to workout in just to doreally light weight weight um activityand to lift weights or whatever but notreally like strenuous running for arunning I prefer my Under Armor bra thatI have these retail for forty eightdollars so not bad for a nice sports braand then I have these headbands which Ialso couldn't find online but they arealways selling them in stores I believethese are just called the flyaway tapersand I think they retail for around $15or $20 I could be wrong but they're nottotally and it's like completelyexpensive like break the bank expensiveand they're just really cute when youwear them the little Lululemon logo kindof shows to the front so if you're intothat that's cool as well but what Ireally like about them is the siliconedetailing on the inside so there's allthese little beads on the inside whereit like touches your hair and that'sabsolutely perfect for people like mewho have like all these crazy-ass littlehairs so just go wherever they want toso when I'm running I love to wear theseI have them in various different colorsand I have them in black as well but Idon't know where that one is the firsttank top I have to show I couldn't findonline but it's just really basic it's along flowy yellow and great striped tanktop and it's a racerback it kind of goesa little bit lower on the sides so ifyou're wearing a cute like bra way orsports bra you can see it on the sideswhich I really like because I shows offmy tattoo here it has a really cutescalloped detailing as well and I thinklast semester LEM and these were on salethey're always kind of on sale indifferent colors because they are sobasic I believe I bought this for 50 ishdollars so that's kind of expensive andhonestly it's just a regular tank top soyeah it's cute it's from Lululemon butthe tank top is not really anythingspecial so I wouldn't really highlyrecommend this unless you really wantthe same one but it's really not thatspecial you can probably get the samething from Target for like ten dollarsand then I have two tank tops that havereally cool like built-in sports brasthe first being in this one again Icouldn'tthis online as well but I'm sure you canfind them in stores because it is kindof a seasonal piece right now and I didbuy this fairly recently so what it isis just a long basic flowy like graytake top and then it has a really coolbuilt-in sports bra so it goes kind oflower in the back and the sports braitself has really cute like detailing inthe back and then it's kind of like ablack and gray camo so really reallynice thing about this shirt and duo isthat the tank top and the sports bra isactually detachable so you can wear iteach piece on its own separately which ithink is absolutely amazingespecially since this shirt I believe Ithink I bought it from maybe 80 or 70dollars which is expensive I know butconsidering you can wear the piecesseparately on its own I think it's kindof great and you know what it's cutesimilarly there's another one of theseshirts that I have it has the built-insports bra as well and then it's just along gray flowy blue and a gray stripedshirt but in the back it's really cutebecause material hangs on really lowkind of just above your waist and thenthe sports bra detailing kind of peeksthrough not paster it's like completelyexposed which is really cute the sportsbra straps are kind of a navy blue likecamo pattern thing going on but thething that I don't like about this isthat it's not detachable like the firstone which kind of sucks because I feellike it would been really easy for themto make this detachable as wellespecially considering like it's afull-on sports bra but it's not so thatkind of sucks as well lastly I have afew tank tops insurance but they're allfrom like the same line from Lululemonand these are absolutely amazing so wellthe basic yellow tank top that I showedisn't all that impressive and honestlyI've tried on a lot of tops and shirtsfrom Lululemon and if they're not supercute I really don't think that thequality or the fit or feel reallyjustifies the really expensive price I'mwilling to pay more money for shirtsthat are cute like the detachable sportsbra and whatnot or are things that fitwell and feel well one lineten tops and shirts that I find to beabsolutely amazing from Lululemonare these and these are called theswiftly tech line and I have a bunch ofthem so basically they are in the tanktop version this is just the crewneckversion it's very or it's just the tanktop arrangement it's very simple raceyour back has a little little lemon atthe front and it's very cute these areso unbelievably comfortable they are sosweat absorbent these are the only tanktops I will wear when I workout inbecause they don't show any sweat marksthey're extremely breathable and they'rekind of have like a cooling effect onyour skin so they don't get overly hotand you don't get overly sticking themthey retail for forty eight dollars andI have them in three different colorsI have it in the gray and then I alsohave a pink one but I have no idea wherethat is so I probably should find thatand then similarly I have the Swift techshort sleeve scoop and this retails for$58 this is really this is really cuteand it's a very casual shirt however Ireally do prefer to wear the tank topswhen I'm working out and just becauselike your pits are free and you like youget more airflow but these this is areally cute shirt as well and since itis the same fabric as the other Swifttype tank tops it's extremelycomfortable likewise I have thislong-sleeve shirt and I feel likeeveryone has this shirt as well this isa swiftly Tech long-sleeve crew and thisis $68 so it is really expensive lastlyI just have forced by shirts or sweatersor jackets that I want to show I havethis one which I couldn't find onlinetoo which is really surprising to mebecause I feel like this is kind of abasic piece that little woman always hasI think it's called the scuba the hoodiebut I could be wrong they'll probablybring it back in the fall or winter I'msure they will because it's just a basichoodie it's very comfortable it has afull zip here which is really nice ithas pockets on the side I like to wearthis after workouts and then also justto run to the store in it's reallycomfortable it's really heavy and so itdoes keep you really warm and as analternative like to a North Face or justa basic hoodie this is really cute Ithink this retails for about $100 sothat ispretty expensive but for like aneveryday casual sweatshirt it's not thatbad price and then this jacket they didhave a line and this is called thedefine jacket and it retails for $108like the first one it's a full lengthzip so it sits all the way down but itdoesn't have the hoodie neck and it is alot more lightweight than the other oneand it also has cuff ins I think that'swhat the clothes where you can like wrapthe material around your little nubs ifyou want that but I don't really usethat and then the pockets themselves arezipped which is really nice as well Ilike to wear this for post workouts andit's just really comfortable and it'scute the next jacket I probably get themost wear out of just because it's themost like fashionable in my opinion so Ilike to wear this for like errands orand I wear it all the time to go toschool in and this is what it looks likethis one also I found online and it iscalled the Makati BHA kti yoga jacketand it's retails for $118 so what'sreally cool about this is that when youwear it you can wear it zipped and itkind of wraps around and zips like thatbut I really like to wear it just likehanging down because I think that thefabric just kind of hanging andcascading down is kind of a really cutelook it's a little bit more edgy thanlike just a regular basic cardigan whichI really like because it has like theblack detailing wear under the sleevesand stuff so and it's a little bit morefitted so it's a really greatalternative other than a cardigan andthe material itself is very comfortableas well I absolutely love this jacket Ithink it's really really cute and Ihighly do recommend this one if you'relooking for kind of a very versatilejacket where you can wear it to goworkout in or after workouts but also tocross over into your daily life this isa perfect jacket for that so those areall the things that I have to show youin my Lululemon

what's up everyone welcome back to myyoutube channel welcome to my youtubechannel if it's your first time i'm soexcited to have you here[Applause]so in today's video i'm doing a haul ofall of my current favorite workoutclothes i believe that workout clothingis arguablythe most fun part about working out andi actually do enjoy working out sothat's saying a lot i just thinkhaving fun workout clothes makes theexperience even betterand honestly workout clothes don't justneed to be for working out like i loveathleisure clothing and a lot of theclothes that i'm going to show today candefinitely just be a cute outfitbopping around town going shoppingrunning errands and soreally excited to just show you all ofmy current favorites i shop at storeslike lululemon like free people i havesome great finds from those stores thatare a little bit more expensive becausei do think that sometimes it is worth itto pay a little bit more for workoutclothesbut that being said i also have somereally cute items fromtarget amazon and a few other storesthat i'll go through sojust know that in this haul there's amix of more high-endworkout clothes and some great dupes andlower costfine and so it is a few things tomention so for sizing i am a size sixi'm pretty mucha true to size size six or like a mediumwherever i goif i get a six or a medium i'm prettymuch going to be goodthere are definitely times that i fitinto a size four or a size eight likedepending on the storeum and you know ladies we just havecertain days that we're justdifferent sizes and that's cool so justan fyi i willtalk about you know the fabric thesizing of these different brands so thatif you are a different size than mehopefully this is still helpful to youand so i'm gonna be showing you all ofthese outfits on me i will link belowall of the items that i can a lot ofthem umshould be able to link so you can goshoppingafter the video so i'm going to startwith free people because i'm actuallyalready wearing a free people crop andif you didn't knowfree people has an entire athletic wearum workout clothing line called freepeople movement i'm obsessed witheverything i've ever purchasedfrom this line because it's such goodquality but mostly becausethe colors in their line and just thestyle is very earthy in bohemian i thinkoften with workout clothing it's a lotof like spandex materialblack colors gray colors greens navieslikefree people has so many variations ofcolors like mutedearth tone so this is actually theirhappiness runs crop i have it in a fewcolorsi love it it's this ribbed material andagain i'm going to show you these itemson me like standing in front of mymirror so you can seei love a lot of their ribbed materialsin their line um because it's justreally flattering and stretchyand so i am wearing the medium large inthis crop topfor a lot of their clothing they run umin two sizes either extra small small ormedium large for their free peoplemovement linei will say it's it has a lot of give soif you're somewhere in the middle likeyou can definitely do the extra smallsmallbut i personally love that it stillsucks me in at this sizebut gives a little bit of like breathingroom i just prefer that in my workoutclothes sotake that with a grain of salt and theni have this one you're gonna be likeokay that's the exact same thingbut i have this top that is technicallythis is like their oat milk color and itis a little bit lighter it's justso comfortable i wear this with jeans iwear it with working out i'll show youin a minute so again the same stylecrop the happiness runs um and thiscolor is desert dunei also want to note that with thisparticular crop the happiness runsthey have it cropped then they have it ithink it's called longer cropand if you have like a longer torso ifyou're taller i'm only five threeum you can definitely get the longercrop version and it'll still be prettyit'll still fall on you nicely um justtake a look on their website and seewhat's best for youbut love the material and style of theseso another crop that i have from themis the same material but it's adifferent style and it is called thefree throw crop topit's basically the same materialas you can see but it's a lower v-cutsuper flatteringreally great length to it i cannot waitto purchase more of these i justbought this one fairly recently in thislike lilac color all of these in thesame sizethat medium large option and it's so socomfortablelast up from free people is this set itis the good karmaset and you can buy these two itemsseparately but i absolutely love themtogetheris in the sand color again we'll linkbelow but you can see even the waiston the pants is this stretchy ribbedmaterial that isjust so flattering and the crop topis really cute as well as you can see itjust matches perfectlylooks so different from any other stylethat i've seenwhich i absolutely love it is in mediumlarge bothoptions i originally actually purchasedthese in the extra small small and itlooked really goodbut it did feel like thinner on my bodybecause i think it was a little snugso i thought it looked good but itdidn't feel great sojust an honest review there that if youprefer things beinga little bit looser on you when you'reworking out then definitely sizeup but if you like things really snugthen size down the material is is justreally forgiving so i think you'll begood either way so i love free peopleif you couldn't tell and i can't wait topurchase more from themum and i've just felt that the qualityof their clothing has been superconsistent and really greatso next up gonna talk about target andshow you some fun items that i havefrom them they have a really greatselection of workout clothesthat i think are you know definitelydupes for some higher end workout gearand so i have this purpleset from target you can see the color isjust so beautifulum it's a matching set that has a sportsbraleggings and then this purple crop topthat i did a little frontknot to add a little something to theset and i think it'sso cute really flattering and stuck inplace which i think is really importantwith workout clothesit's one thing to look nice but it'sanother thing to actually work for youwhile you're working out the size ofthis set is medium again i'm a prettystandard medium soum i think for target sizing it's prettyon par with my body um i will sayrandom that target bathing suits howeveri think are not true to size but that'sjust another thingand then just two crop tops that arefrom target and honestly idon't wear these working out i've wornthese doing yoga butagain like athleisure fun workoutclothes to wear not working out i'm afan of they are just theselittle tie-dye crop topsand i think they are so fun even justwith leggingsthey're that ribbed material if you canseei just really love a good ribbedmaterial because i think it's soforgiving and so flattering anythingthat's ribbed is for meyeah i just really think these are socute on the weekendsrunning errands um and that being said iwanted to just show you these big cozyzip ups because i love the look of a bigoversized zip up when you're wearinglike workout clothes whether you'regoing to the gym again frolicking aroundwhatever it ish m has really good quality zip ups umand soboth of these are from h m in extralarge size so that they're super baggyjustreally flattering again they look goodthey look trendy i think and i justthink it's a really fun way toum style workout clothes in athleisurehave it in this gray color and blackcolorfound them from h m and they were reallyaffordable like i don't remember thecost exactly because it was a few monthsago that i purchased these i find myselfwearing them very often soi will link those below so you can checkthem out if you like them next up isamazon and i'm really excited to talkthrough some of the good finds that ihaverecently discovered on amazon and amdefinitely going to be purchasingmore of in different colors the firstset is this blue if you can see it downhere this blueworkout matching set that is a shortsleeve cropand these like short little booty shortsituationthat is so cute and so flattering i'm soexcited about it to me they're like agym shark dupeif you couldn't tell it's a very similarmaterial in this set i am a size mediumit's very true to size i would not havesized up or sized downi just think they're so cozy i just gotthese in recently so i have not workedout in this set yetbut i did look at the reviews and itsaid that for working out you know it'svery good quality stays in placeso really excited about this set i thinkthe color is sounique it's like in person a very skyblueand i don't have any workout clothes inthis color i'm usually muchmore into pinks and purples but love agood blue apparently becausei'm very into that set so i'm gonna bebuying it in other colors it has a bunchofpink tones green tones grays blacks sodefinitely check that out on amazon andthe next set is the set that isall over tik tok but figured i wouldinclude it because i do actually reallylike it and i think it's a very goodquality for the pricebut it is this sand colored set thatagainyou've probably seen but maybe youhaven't seen it on someone's body thatlooks like minegot this set in a medium as well and ijust think it's really flattering andjustholds everything in place it has thisgrip material underneaththe bra and at the top of the leggingsthat is justmeant to shape your body and stick inplaceso i've worn this set doing yoga and ireally liked itso definitely check it out if you'relooking for a neutral set i'm not surewhat this would be a dupe of i thinkit's kind of its own thingum but i just think it's really reallycomfortable really cute i've also wornit underneath like a big oversizedsweater on the weekends cozying up withmy husbandso recommend this set as well so thelast two items from amazonare lululemon dupes for sure and they'refrom that brand on amazon that's likecrzyoga i'm pretty sure again linked belowi cannot remember all these things butthey are definitely the best lululemondupes that i have foundso both pieces these leggings and thiscrop top are definitelylululemon dupes for the align stylethey're just like buttery softand can definitely support you for aworkout or just be cozy however you wantto wear thembut i just think the material is socomparable to the align materialwhich everyone loves so finding a gooddupe for that that is not going torun down your bank account is alwaysnice in my opinionso i want to get more colors i kind ofstuck to some more neutral colors incase i didn't like itbecause i don't know that just feltsafer to me but iactually do really like these materialsand i have worn them i can definitelysay that theyare great quality and i will be buyingmore of them from amazon and also thoseleggings i did purchase when i wastraining for the marathonand i did training in them and i feltlike they were really good qualityand definitely did the trick while i wasrunning in crazy temperatures and allthat good stuff soalso that's another thing if you arereally into rigorous workout trainingsand things like thati would honestly say that these aregreat quality and a good option for youif you need a lot of them because you'reworking out a lot umso yeah i am going to be doing an amazonhaul video i think two videos from nowand i'm going to be including some of myfavorite amazon clothing piecesthat i'm not talking about today sodefinitely check that out tooplugging my own video yep next up is abrand calledbooty by bra bands and i knowthat she the founder um isfrom my area in the greater boston areabut i havebeen seeing a lot of people all over thecountry wearing her line which is socool to see she's actually from the townnext to meand i think that's awesome she's doinggreat things so if you haven't heard ofthis brand is what i'm getting atdefinitely check them out we'll link theproducts below butthey are incredible and the cool thingabout this lineis that the material is so differentfrom anything else and i will say that ihave been seeinga lot of other brands trying totake her style and like make it theirown um which is what everybody doesrighttotally fine but i will say that justfrom looking at other people with thestyles on them i don't think that it'sas good as her linein my opinion so i only have one top atthis point frombooty by bra bands and it is this whitetop it is in the croco skinstyle that is really cute and i have apaired with these cropped leggings thatare the original fabric and the only bigdifference between the two materials isjust that thistop material the croc skin is thickerthan this original fabric leggings soleggings are again cropped if you are myheightand um you know around 5'3 get thecropped if you like where this ishitting meon my leg so i have this in the tie-dyecolor and also in thismauve color same material it's theoriginal fabric just a little bitthinner thanthe croc skin material and socomfortableflattering again it fits all sizes youknow you don't have to worry aboutpicking your size because you'll knowthat it willlook great on you um and then i alsohave these leggings that areum just plain black but they are in thecroco skin so a little bit thicker andif you're just looking for somethingthat's maybe a little bit warmer in thewinteror something that is just going toreally suck you in go for the croc skinit's just a bit thicker but looks prettymuch the sameand so i have this in the cropped andthe regular length i will say that thefull length i usuallyroll up underneath my ankle because it'sa little bit too long for mebut it does get the job done and it'sgreat for the winter timeso yeah those are my favorite piecesfrom booty by bra bands and my onlypieces that i have right now and i planto purchase more as time goes onbut for now i just really love thatbrandall right and then last up is of courselululemon we cannot do a haul withoutlululemon the goatum and if you don't like lululemonthat's that's just fine toobut i can't knock them right they aredefinitely a more expensive brandbut the quality is just really good imean i've had lululemon leggings foryears that are definitely at this pointa little bit worn out that i'm not goingto show in this videobut i think they're just really goodquality and meantto last you a long time yeah i'm justgonna show basically my favorite piecesfrom lululemonum so that you can go out and get themor just i don't know hear an honestreviewfirst is the align crop top that i thinkeveryone knows and has heard about it'sjustthis dusty pink color um crop top that iwearpretty often i really think the qualityis justthe best out of a lot of crop topstyles that are similar to this so i dohave other tops from lululemon that arejust a little bit olderand i don't love as much anymore so i'mjust going to show you this top for thishaulbut paired with this top now are theseleggings from luluso these leggings are the swift speedhigh-riselegging from lulu in a size six and ijust really like the design of these ithink it's pretty uniqueand abstract which i just really likeand i think is veryflattering when you have differentthings going onon your bottom so definitely a funlonger pantthese are the align crops in like a sagegreen color i'm not sure the exactname of the color but i'll link it belowand again we all know a line is thatbuttery soft material that isreally cozy pretty flattering i will saythat a line is not meant tosuck you in it's really meant to just becomfortable soif you are looking for something that'sreally going to hold you ina line is probably not the best fit foryou but um i really just think they'regreat for lounging aroundand then last are these align bikershortsand the this length i'll link below it'slike their midlength biker short you can get them evenshorter than this and even longer but ireally love that perfect you knowmiddle of the road biker short lengthbecause it's flattering if you're takinglike a spin class it's not going to rideup too muchand all that good stuff so yes those aremy favorite lululemon pieces right nowand i will link them below um and so asmentionedthat was the last piece of the haul andum the last portion here so thanks somuch forwatching this video i hope that it wasexciting and helpful and all of thatgood stuffto just see me in these pieces and hearsome honest reviewsfrom companies that i really like i willagain mention i

hey guys so it's me with completely nomakeup this is how I just am chillintoday because I did not feel like doinga full face of makeup I actually in factconvinced myself that I was gonna go geta spray tan earlier so when I get aspray tan I don't wear makeup becausethen it just like when you wash thosemakeup off your face is a lot lighterthan your body and so I didn't makeup onand then I just didn't have time to justspray tan so this is just what I looklike so you guys are gonna see aLululemon haul in a little bit I went toLululemon when I was in Florida with myfamily and my sister and I went and gotsome fun stuff I got a gift card to Lulufor my birthday and you guys know I'mcompletely obsessed with these pantsthese are the align pants and so you'regonna see the those not these exact onebut you're gonna see how glad the alignpanel Hall and we did some really goodfootage for you so you can see an ideaof the fit and my sister's in the videotoo which is fun so I don't know I justthought that I would have a chat withyou today so anyway I wanted to justupdate you guys on like what's going onwith me so you know I'm not competinganymore I did a whole video on how I'mnot competing anymore and I just want toupdate you on like my eating and thingslike that so when I was in Florida Istarted just intuitive eating again andI did a couple full day of eating videosthat you guys may have seen and if youwatch those back you'll notice I waseating a ton of whole foods like fruitsand vegetables and I was getting in adecent amount of protein too but I waseating a lot of like raw fruitssmoothies juices things like that andI'm not a juice cleanse person I don'tlike juice cleanses and I honestly Idon't recommend them some clients willask me about them and I'm not a fan ofthem because they do not give you enoughsustenance throughout the day it's notenough calories not enough nutrition andjuices hat are just loaded with kind ofsugar and carbs but it is also a littlebit if you drink some juice it can likereset your body and for me it kind ofjust flushes out some toxins and so if Idrink even like one or two juices a daywith normal food but cleaner foods I'llfeel so much better so honestly thewhole week I was in Florida I felt greatand then I came home and I kind of wentback to my like normal way of eating alotand I didn't feel good again so Istarted getting more juices and thingslike that and I've been intuitive eatingbut I've been doing a little bit more ofjuicing it's been getting rid of myheadaches and I get like some liketension related headaches but then I canget not caffeine headaches I'm notexactly sure even what causes them butsometimes I just get like littleannoying headaches so the juices havingthat has helped a little bit with myheadache so I've been having some acaibowls some smoothies I've actually beendoing like wheatgrass shots a lot and Idon't know I've just been really intocleanwhole food type eating and intuitiveeating so let's say my body and notsuper tracking my macros right now I'mgonna get back into it but I kind ofgave myself the week especially the weekthat my team was here we were eating alot of good foods and then we had likesome fun foods too like pizza becausewe're all huge fans of pizza but yeah soI just want to tell you don't be afraidto mix it up the best thing that you cando for yourself always a solace intoyour body so if your body's exhaustedand you're supposed to work out butyou're so tired you can barely keep youreyes open don't work out because whatyour body needs is restjust like with my body reacting to kindof the higher protein a little bit moreprocessed food coming back from Floridawas kind of like rejecting that so I'vebeen eating a little bit cleanerrecently not getting quite as muchprotein as I usually do but still enoughand eating more intuitively andsometimes my body needs that and he's alittle bit of a reset where I have somemore fruits and things and especiallycoming into like the spring and summerseason where all of that is really freshand it's getting to be in season and soI really like that it makes me feelreally good and so listen to your bodyguys I think that's something thatpeople really fail to do or don't dovery well because they feel like theyhave to do in a certain way or they haveto get their work out in our they haveto hit their protein number in yeahideally like 95 percent of the timethat's gonna be the case but there'sgonna be times when your body just needsa break and I need something and it'sokay to give it to it to go over yoursugar and give it to it or go over onyour carbs and give it what it needs orrest andto work out that's okay so we're allabout balance myself as a personaltrainer that's why I trained my clientsat three has been des we're about thestrength to sweat in the soul and thesoul is is your mind and your bodyconnection and it's just listening toyour body when your mind is telling youthat you need to so it's a reallyimportant part of the process you can'tbe perfect all the time and justaccepting that and giving your body andyourself what you need and then movingon to the next day is the best thingthat you can do so I just thought Iwould give you that little nugget justbecause I've been thinking a lot aboutit over the last couple weeks just abouthow I'm usually pretty good with mymacros and I haven't really beentracking them but I've been feelingreally good and kind of before Florida Iwas feeling a little bit sluggish so itwas kind of the reset that I've neededand I think probably in a week I'll feelreally good and I'll be able to get backto my macro tracking and stuff and Ihave a fun video let me know in thecomments if you guys are excited andwant to see it but I've been planning avideo on the five best macro trackingapps and I'm gonna be filming that foryou guys students I'm really excited toshow you guys that it's gonna give yousome really good insight into differentapps for iPhone and Android and whatthey can offer you and things like thatbut I hope this helped you I hope thishelps somebody and enough rambling forme we can go ahead and watch theLululemon haul but give this video athumbs up if you don't mind these littlechats that we have because things thatyou know I'm thinking about her I'mstruggling with I always assume otherpeople are struggling with it's like youknow what did the teacher say to youwhen you were in class write it there'snever a stupid question because if youhave a question about something there'slike a 90% chance that somebody else hasthe exact same question as you so don'tfeel be afraid to ask the question it'sjust like with these my differentthoughts and struggles I'm always likeit's if I'm struggling with thissomebody might be struggling with it tooso I hope that if somebody was thinkingabout this I helped you if you guys haveany questions you can always email mestrength sweat so at gmail.com andthat's it so let's go check out thislittle lemon

so guys I'm a little shook right now I'mnot gonna lie these are the softestthings I've ever put in my body what'sup guys and welcome back to my channeland today I am actually so excited toshare these with you because I did notexpect to love these so much but theseare incredible so today I'm going to betalking about the new colorful koalabrush leggings and I have reviewedcolorful koala on my channel before andlike a Lulla Lulla min dukes video and Iwas their original fabric which has likekind of a shiny exterior but like abrushed interior and I have a pair ofthose that I wear like probably at leastonce or twice a week that's how much Ilove them and these are so incrediblelike I just tried them on for the firsttime and I was like wow they're there'ssomething so special about these so I'vecompared the original color for koalasto the Lululemon online pants and theLululemon aline pants are kind of like acult favorite like like everyone hasthem they are super buttery soft andlike how they had that brush texturethey like conform to your body but theyjust they don't squish down anything andbecause of that they also don't give alot of compressions if you wantcompression they don't really give thatbut they fit basically look perfectlythey're just incredible leggings and thething that people have a hard time likecopying from them like when they try tomake dupes of them is the fabric usuallythe fabric is too thick and kind ofsquishes you down and lace you don'twant it's just like not quite there butthis fabric on these new colorful koalaleggings is the closest I've ever seen -the Lululemon NuLu fabric which is thefabric of the Allianceso yeah the key word and these newleggings is brushed and that is likethat super smooth texture of theLululemon aligning fabrics a new lipfabric so this fabric it feels soft tothe it feels soft to the touch andconforms with your body without beinglike heavy and restricting and mostimportantly it doesn't squish in thebooty down so ifthe edits fullest potential which islove but who wouldn't want that so theirreviews on these they're mostly greatreviews there are a lot I'm just goingto read there's a lot of reviews sayingthey're closethey're a lot closer to the Lululemonaligns than other colorful koalas sopeople say that these are very soft andthey don't have any compression but Ifind it a little em'ly no lines alsodon't have any compression that's notwhat they are made for they're made ofthe yoga pant to be very you knowfree-flowing and flexible so they're notthere to like hold you in in any waysome people also commented about somepilling but to be honestLululemon fabric spill so badly on meanyway my Lululemon aligns have havepilling so this when you just have thatreally smooth kind of like cottony tatfabric instead of the shiny fabric youjust are going to get some pilling andthat's just like what's going to happenlike that's the trade-off you get fromhaving the real they're really goodsoftness but you can kind of help thatfrom happening and by washing yourleggings inside out I like to dosometimes washing them in a laundry bagis really nice too and never do not trythem do not try them you were justasking for pills but even doing allthose things I still got some pills inmy Lululemon the lines so one of thecomments was the dupe we have all beenlooking for and honestly I can totallyrelate to that this is a literally theLouvre of an allied dupe that you wantto purchase if you want something closeto the luminal lines there are also afew comments about like some of theleggings wearing stand and having holesbut then there's another comment thatsaid that they can personally confirmthat the Lightning's have an updatedfabric because they had some negativereviews and colorful koala actually fixthe fabric and if people complainedabout it I can set it to colorful koalato actually send them new pairs ofleggings so I think they have greatcustomer service and they really listento what the people are wanting and Ithink they also will probably be comingout with new colors soon because I wouldif they love that because they're socute anyway let's get into the detailsso these leggings are $28.99 justslightly more expensive than the lastcolorful koalas I think the last oneswere 22 so for an extra like five sixdollars I think these are totallytotally worth it and if you want thatbrushed texture I mean five or sixdollars really isn't a lot in the grandscheme ofan alliance are like around $100 soyou're still saving a lot of money thefabric is a nylon spandex blend and theyfeel very close to the Lululemon's Ihave real lines with me I have myAlliance so these are my little m in thelines let me put them right side out Itold you I wash them inside out so sothese are the lumina lines as you cansee the fabric is just like very softbut you can also see that they arestarting to have a few little pills Idon't know if you can tell it all butthere's definitely a little pillinggoing on in the colorful koalas lookvery very similar they feel supersimilar to I'd say that the colorfulkoalas are like the tiniest bit morecottony and a little more plush pandaLululemon alliance or just like verythin but soft but here are the fabricsclose up as you can see they look veryclose and they're both have that brushedvery smooth texture I personally lovethe original colorful koalas becausethat slick texture doesn't pill which isgreat for me because I wear my leggingsto dance and a lot and like I you knowI'm a little rough girl with them inthat sense and I really don't want themto pill and I do have to just warn youthat these this fabric will likely havea little bit of pilling but just like doyour best to take care of it and it'llhelp but it definitely will have somepilling but the lemon a-line isdefinitely appealing - so that's notlike that that's not like an issue withthis legging let's just look the natureof the fabric as for quality they feellike very very high quality and theseams actually look really good my oldcolorful koalas we do have to say someof the strings did come undone but Iwould just kind of like clip off thestrings that were off and like I didn'thave any holes left or anything and youcouldn't even tell so for like a twentydollar pair of leggings I can deal witha few strings you know especially if itdoesn't result in any like visible holesor damage but I do have to say thatthese new colourful koalas the seamslook like they look double stitched andjust super super high quality yeah soit's bearable seethere are no strings so far but thereare a few of these little fuzzy bitsthough but I think that's because thefabric is so soft so as for detailsthese do have that seamless waistbandwhich Lululemon is known for and it'sjust so flattering because this littlebottom seam holds the leggings up andthese leggings did not fall down on meat all but the top seam doesn't cut intoyour waist but it still kind of likegives you a little shape you know so itgives you shape because it is a doublethickness but it doesn't cut into yourwaist because it doesn't have like aband at the top they also have theextended gusset crotch which theLululemon Alliance have also so if youdon't know what that means it just meansthat it has this little like double seamgoing down the side of the leg and thisis supposed to like prevent camel toeand like Anza legging to fit a littlebetter around the crotch and thesearen't just about full length on me theydo fall slightly above my ankle so ifyou are on the taller side they are notthe most full length of leggings but Iactually like more of a 7/8 like youknow I would say this is longer than 70sbut not quite full length on me but ifyou're like anything shorter than 5 9these will totally be full length on youmy measurements are also into thedescription below if you wanted to knowask for sizing they come in size extrasmall to extra large so they have apretty good size range and I always geta small I got a small on these and theyfit just like my other call for colorfulkoala smallsthey fit just like any gym shark small Iwear Lululemon size 6 again mymeasurements are below but these fitvery true to size I'd say I did see itlike a comment or two about theserunning a little smaller but Idefinitely don't feel that way that Iwouldn't I wouldn't change the size ofthese I felt like they were perfect theydon't have the greatest color range atthis point they have black midnight navyand this wine color wine red so thatI have I got this like I got the winecolor because I thought you'd be able tosee details a little better than likethe black and I think the midnight navywas sold out so they definitely areselling out and I bet they will get morecolors but they ought they restock likepretty frequently these are totallysquat proof even with my you know reallybright ring light which is excellent soyou could wear these to the gym cameltoeI really didn't see any these are alsodark color so you can't tell as much butI would say no camel toe the last onesdidn't give me any camel toe either I'madding a new metric to my legging reviewpoints which is the cellulite check soon my on my original colorful koala's Ihave the lilac color in the black and onthe lilac you can there is a little bitof like cellulite happening I don't havelike a ton of cellulite per se but I dohave that little like under but you knowthe little extra crease and you candefinitely see that on my originalcolorful koalas but these the fabricdoes feel slightly thicker but notnotconstricting way I just wanted to pointout but I did not see the little doublebutt at all it's also a darker color soI'd be interested to see in how and howthat works with the lighter colors butthey don't really have lighter colorsyet but yeah I did these definitely arecellulite proof at least in the colorthat they currently have available soyeah see that's all I have to say aboutthe leggings these are probably some ofthe best leggings I've put on my body ona long time and they're under $30 whichis just incredible I will keep you guysupdated on how they wear but keep inmind with this kind of fabric you aregoing to get some kind of like some linton it you know it doesn't like becauseit's so soft it just kind of catchesthat stuff so just so you know but theseare literally incredible as I was tryingthem on I literally gasped because theywere so soft on my body and guys I can'trecommend these enough you really needto get yourself a pair these are sogreat I didn't know colorful koala cameout with these activate these new onesbut they are so nice so go get yourselfa pair you want them trust me and theyreally do compared to the Lululines I often have something to sayabout the liking said it's like oh it'slike the Lulu lines but they don't havethis but these are almost exact dupesfor the Lululemon Alliance like this isthe best I've ever seenso if you are looking for that Lululemonalai Duke these are definitelydefinitely the thing you need to go foryou know I hope that was helpful sothank you guys so much for watching andI will see you next time

hey guys today I'm going to do aLululemon haul I absolutely love buyingFitness clothes and Lululemon is thecompany that I prefer the most out ofNike and all the other high-end brands Ijust think we lemon to me is where Iwould prefer to spend my money I justlove their material I love all thethings I purchased in the past and theydo have a sales section so actually allthe things I'm going to show you today Idid find in their discount section whichis really great I checked in a few timesthis is like three separate purchasesput together alright so the first thingI'm going to start off with is theirwhat the sport short so these are shortsthat are meant for working out so I gotthese in size 6 and these usuallyretailed for $58 but they were 39 in thediscount section so these are reallynice I love the material I really likethe color so there are a little bitlonger you do have a bit of an inseam afew inches so it's not as short as theirbooty shorts you have pockets as well onthis one so you have a really nice widewaistband that says lululemon athleticathen you've got the little pockets ontop which shows the size you can putkeys or a dollar or two in there youhave bigger pockets on the side as wellso you could put a phone comfortably inthe side pocket so these are good I'dsay for cycling or running just good forthe summer and I really love the color Ihave a lot of black and dark workoutclothes it's really nice to have somebrighter bottomsnext is a sport bra so this one is theall you need bra so I got this insidesex it was supposed to be fifty twodollars and I got it for thirty-nine sothis is a really nice comfortable sportsbra there's a little bit of nettingdetail at the top they're pretty skinnybrought like the straps are pretty thinand they come together at the backreally nicely so this one I wouldsay is good for small chests so ifyou're a size a or B I think you reallylike this one what's interesting withthis bra is it doesn't come with anyplace to put in the removable cups Ithink it might just be a little bit toothin in the front part for them to fityou do have enough coverage though soyou'll be okay without them but ifyou're looking for something for supportthis isn't the bra for youalthough Lululemon has a huge variety ofbras some are for really big girls verysupportive sports bras this one's justfor light support so I really like thata nice hot pink color you can't go wrongwith that okay so I did get another pairof shorts so these ones already run fourdays short so these are in size six aswell these are supposed to be $68 and Igot them for 49 so these are really niceand comfortable I have similar shorts tothis in black so I really like thesethese are really comfortable so they area short sort there's the front and theback so these come with a really nicezip up pocket here so you can put inyour keys if you have a small iPod oranything you don't fit in there and inthe front you do have those smallpockets as well so that's really greatthese come with a built-in underwear orlike bathing suit kind of things so youdon't have to worry if you're running orworking out in these doing squats oranything that they're gonna be toorevealing you're already fully coveredinside so really great they're nice andairy they have like a cut that comes upa little bit higher on the side so theseare really great for summer for workingout for running great materials are justawesome for summer I'm definitely goingto wear them a lot the black pair I haveI wear those all the time and they'rejust really really comfortablenext is this tank top so this is their acool racerback this is supposed to be 42and I got it for 24 which is reallyreally great so half price and Iactually really like the color so it's abasic whyshape I'm sporting the sports bra tanktop you can trace her back so I reallylike it I like how thin the back is someare a lot wider and I just really likeit's very comfortable it doesn't have abuilt-in sports bra or anything so it'sjust really nice and light I've worn itto work out it's so comfortable it'sreally nice and long which I appreciatebeing six feet tall I like my tops tonot kind of lift up in my stomach when Iwear them so I really really like thisand also considering it's such a lightcolor it's not see-through at all soI've worn like a black bra under thisand it wasn't see-through whereas a lotof like wife beaters they're reallysheer so I really like that and it's avery like artistic kind of print soreally excited I've won that quite a fewtimes next is this tank top so and thisis their a dancing warrior tank so thisone was supposed to be 58 and it wasdown to 29 so another one half price soit's a really nice pink tank top withthin straps and there's a bit ofdetailing on the back I'm not sure ifit's gonna show while holding it upprobably not but like a crisscross anddarker like ribbon so goes down the backof it and yeah really nice so as I saidwith the sports bra most of them haveplaces for the cups so you can seethere's a little opening there and alltheir tank tops also have this reallynice like vent in the chest which Ireally enjoy when you're working out ithelps it feel a little bit cooler it'snot too like hot and yeah this is areally nice tank top really nice andlong so I'm going to wear this a lot itwould be great for yogait's a light support once again so ifyou're bigger you could wear a bra withit but with the cups you'd be okay withthat just alone okay and the last thingis the inner essence crop so these aresupposed to be- they're going to 59 so I really likethe wide waistband really similar tothose blue shorts that I got so theseare crops that go just to the kneewhereas a lot of their other crops go abit longer I tried on size 6 with theseand it was too tight it's a really tightfitting pant they didn't have size 8 soI actually went for size 10 which iscrazy but they actually fit me reallywell so I don't mind so you've got thiscool detailing on the side and I justnoticed that there's a little pocket uphere so in the waistband you can go inand it's a really big pocket it goesdown to there so you could definitelyput like an iPhone or anything

today I want to talk about Lululemonlululemon is trading at sixty sixdollars and seven cents a share theirrevenue in 2015 was posted at one pointeight million dollars at twelve pointnine percent increase over the 2014revenue of fifteen point nine billiondollars their 2014 revenue was a16-point one percent increase over 2013so although 2015 revenue growth was alittle bit less than 2014 they still hadbeat first corner expectations so from areddit perspective it looks like theirperformance as well but if you look intotheir costs the cost of goods sold haveincreased in 2015 the rest GNA isincreased slightly so their margins aredeclining um this brings you know alittle bit of uncertainty into theirfinancials it brings a little bit ofuncertainty into their eps performanceit brings a little bit of uncertainty ortranslates into a little bit ofuncertainty in their stock performanceso it looks like their current market atmy valiant of 2015 you is at 18.6 timesearnings so if you look at the value oftheir cash flows and if you discounttheir cash flows back to present valueit looks like the value of their cashflow should represent an overall valuethe business of 14.8 times enterprisevalue butta which would translate to astock price of about 50 for 255 dollarsper share however if you believe more inmarket multiples as you believe incurrent market multiples depending onwho which competitors you're using ascomparable companies their enterprisevalue to each I could go as high as 25times which would imply a stock price ofnine dollars per share so this is quitean uncertain range from a low blow towhere they're trading a 14-point 80 latthe 25.7 depending on how you believe ifyou believe in the market and thisuncertainty does reflect the uncertaintyof the industry as a whole you know thisis a retail company you can probablyread a lot about the recent news of gapclosing a lot of stores I think that's areflection of retail is just a verydifficult industry to be investing inright now there's a lot of uncertaintyand thethe range of the multiples from 40projects 25.7 is a good reflection ofthe uncertainty of the industry as awhole so you know i would i would putthis one on hold and wait to see theindustry to see if the HD turns aroundif does it all again but retail for forfor quite a while now and still theoutlook is is a little bit uncertain soi would i would kind of hold on lookingat this any further for now if anybodyif item i has any questions please letme know thank you for watching tradingon time,27,UCnjZIh413VZ5QkknUlHvc-w,Paul Pignataro,0,0,0,1,"['Lululemon Athletica (Business Operation)', 'Finance (Industry)', 'Financial Modeling (Literature Subject)', 'Valuation (Literature Subject)', 'Technical Analysis (Website Category)', 'Fashion (Industry)']",Trading on Technicals - Lululemon,olLLkK7cwPE,254

hey guys today I'm going to do a fitnesshall i'm going to show you the productsi purchased recently i got some thingsfrom Lululemon i got some things frommarshalls and winners so hopefully youguys enjoy this hall so before we getinto clothing let's start off with somefitness accessories so I actually gotthe Fitbit charge and I've only had thisfor a day so I will probably do a reviewon this I just got the basic black onein the size small and so far I'm reallyreally impressed so this is a trackingwatch that I checks your heart ratethroughout the day it tracks youractivity and workouts and monitor issleep but displays um people who arecalling you on your phone on your watchwhich is really cool so I'm very excitedi just downloaded the app to my phoneand everything so i am really lookingforward to that i probably will do areview if you guys are interested inseeing that moving on to headbands i gotto head bands from Lululemon so thisfirst one is a black one and its reallyinteresting you can see a slight patternon it and it's got a really thickelastic at the back and their logo thisis also reversible so you can wear it onthe pink side and you can wear it verywide or you can kind of bunch it up andwear it as a smaller head band so thatwas great and this one in my favoriteblue color I love this color so samedesign here except you've got blue andthis mint green and it's reversible aswell okay so let's move on to lululemontank tops so I got to tank tops andsports bras put together and I honestlywould recommend these so much especiallyif you find them on sale so I foundthese they're both forty dollars from 64and 58 so I would definitely wait forthings to go on sale if you are on abudget um but with lululemon like Ialways try to find things onand they honestly last four years isdefinitely a really great investment andI would pick lululemon over any otherFitness brand it's definitely myfavorite so the first one is the wild atank so I got this in size 8 and thisone actually I'm glad I got size 8because it would have been too small ifI got size 6 so this one is so beautifulyou've got a really nice coral tank topand the sports bra is so cute it'sactually like butterflies on the sportsbra so you have a really nice open backconcept and what I like first of all asports bra is really comfortable withall the straps it feels so comfortableit feels like there's no wait just onone certain spot so it's great to wear Iwear it all day long you've got built-incups so you can put in so you don't haveto wear a bra with it and I've onethat's working out like an hour and ahalf two hours and it feels so light thematerial is so light it feels likeyou're not wearing anything which isgreat if you're going really hard at thegym so I really really love this I woulddefinitely recommend it and in thefuture I'm going to buy a lot more ofthese styles of tops I think are reallyamazing and then the next time I got isthe tough it out tank so this one is 39instead of 58 so this is the secondsportswear I got actually in this kindof material the black and white styleand this comes with a really cute bluetank top which once again the materialis very very light and this sports braseems to be really full coverage and youcan see the back is very interestingthere so it's almost like the sports brais like under the shirt but then thiscomes over the shirt so really cool veryinteresting and all of these sports brasand tank tops have spots you can insertcups so you don't have to wear a brawith them and these ones are both meantfor like B to C cup girls so um yeah Igot both of these in size 8 and they fitme really well so moving on to sportsbras I did buy a few I feel like I havea lot of tank topand I wanted to get a little bit moresports bras in my collection so I gottwo from Lululemon and these are theirsplendor bras these retail for $52 eachI got both of mine in size six sothey're already a bit on the tighterside for me which is really great one ofthem I got four twenty-nine dollars oneI bought for thirty-nine dollars so thegreen one is the one I got for 29 Iguess the color wasn't very popular butI think it's really interesting it'slike a kind of Christmas green and thisone has two straps so it has likeregular sports bra strap and then italso has these small straps coming overthe front so I really like that and atthe bottom it shows a little spacethrough there so you can see thatthey're separate straps this feels verysupportive compared to some other sportsbras I like how this one has the spacefor the cups and this one is meant for Cto D cup girls so if you are a littlebigger chested then you can still wearthis without another bra and then theother one I got which was 39 is thisreally nice pink and purple reallybeautiful color Sam design I think theseare really great and I've been where Iknees like all day as my bra justbecause they're so comfortable and theydon't completely flattened youespecially because there's the cups inthere they're just really great and youcan throw any light tank top on top ofthose and you feel good to go okay I gota really affordable sports bra fromgarage so I want to try this one outit's a purple color with a big blackbottom and straps that cross at the backso it is really great this one has cupsas well that you can remove and I findthis one pretty comfortable to wear thenI got two sports bras from winners theyhave so much fitness closeout doesn'trecommend going there if you're on abudget so this one I've never heard ofthis brand it's since Sarah yoga so Igot this one in medium this was reallyaffordable I think this was 10dollars so you got a black strap and thegray and blue and a really thin whystrap at the back and then you've gotthis one I think this was acollaboration nike and another brand soi really like the color it's brightpurple with splatters on it and at theback you've got some nice and netting soyou feel very nice and light and thisone feels like really good full coverageas well so continuing on with LululemonI got two pairs of their skinny groovepants so I've never tried these let thestyle of pants I love their regularblack yoga pants but these ones I was solucky to find these on sale for 59instead of a hundred and they wereperfect size 6 which is my size andshockingly the perfect length for meeven though I'm six feet tall theyactually go all the way down so I got toI think you know something that good isthere I should just go for it and I'vebeen wearing these pretty much every dayto work I just think they're socomfortable and I've been working as atrainer so black bottoms is all I needso really like these just right basicblock I do have a bit of cat hair onthem right now they are really nice andthin all the way down really reallycomfortable and these are reversible aswell and then I got two bottoms fromwinners so I got these shorts which arereally interesting from Nike and theseare in size medium so what you've got isa really tight short underneath which isreally stretchy and comfortable with anice print on it and then you've got anover laying short that is loose and youcan actually see through it especiallywhen you're wearing them um it startedout to being pretty sheer the onlycomplaint I have is that I should havegone for a large when I have these onand the other material is not stretchyso I feel like my butt's just a littlebit too big to fit in these right nowbut I'm going to keep them all try themmaybe in a month or two if I've lost aninch they should fit perfectly thenthe adidas TECHFIT climate light tightsI got medium compression these arereally really pretty i really like thecolor a nice deep blue and these go downto just I think above the knee yeahreally nice thick waistband I'm not ahuge fan of adidas bottoms usually Ifind they can fall down or they're toolong or they just don't fit me properlybut I find these ones feel reallycomfortable and they don't go likesee-through when you're doing squats oranything so I think I'm really happywith these and you really can't go wrongfrom winners or marshalls I'm gettingmore expensive brands at an affordableprice okay so the last thing I go on arethese nike free shoes so these arereally great they are hot pink and theirlittle dirty be more I know quite a bitbut these are really great support andcan see there's quite a lot at thebottom there so I feel like I can standnine hours a day I can do leg workoutsand everything else with these shoes andfeel really comfortable and I was reallylucky I went to night or falls and Ibought these at like an outlet store soit was only forty dollars from about ahundred so those are all the things ipurchased recently i hope you enjoyedthis video don't forget to like it andsubscribe for more videos like this ihope you guys have a great day and we'llsee you guys next time bye,26,UCQzxgmvq93rmspVHoSmcxEg,JustEnufEyes,7,1,0,15,"['JustEnufEyes',

everybody is miss Philly I have anotherthrift haul handbag video for you guystoday and I accumulated all of thesehandbags from Value Village aka saversand today is Saturday and I purchasedthese for 30% off of what this thickerprice was now granted tomorrow I couldhave purchased them for 50% off but Ihave a feeling that the bag just won'tbe there anymore and someone would havegrabbed them somebody probably havegrabbed them today for 30% often notwait tomorrow for that because you know20% isn't well it is a big it's a coupleof dollars but it's not enough for me todive into a crowd of people looking fora sale because by village aka savers ishaving a sale on Sunday 50% off of BedBath sub Beauty accessories clothing andif you're a club card remember like I amyou get early access which is Sunday andthen it's opened the sails open to ageneral public on a Monday so yeah whenI was about I'm not gonna risk going andyou know I don't want to have to cut upyou know that it was really no mo thefirst thing I purchased was this Coachbag it's like a metallic taupe color andthe price of this was $34.99 minus 30%so I guess that would be like $28 ifsome does guess I'm not good at matheven though masion doesn't mean I'mgonna map okay and there are some issueswith it again with a scuffing but I'llfix that with my leather moisturiser andcleaner but the handles are good iintact it's a nice roomy bag that's whatit looks like inside and yeah I don'tknow I'm probably going to resell thisso we'll see and it comes complete witha coach hang tag which usually it'llcome with but so it's good that it camewithask you I might use it myself I mean Ilike the color I like that it's not tooheavy I like that it's just basic andsimple you don't even know that it'scoach so the next bag I purchased wasthis oneit's a Lululemon kind of duffel miniduffel bag I guess it's really cute Ilike it and it's Lululemon this probablyretails for about a hundred plus dollarsand I got it for $49.99 - 50% no 30%sorry I wish I was ready for that but umI was in excellent condition I love thatit has this snap to keep the handlestogether it's very roomy inside it'slike this bag actually kind of remindsme of the lug line very roomy inside youhave multiple pockets and compartmentseven like a mesh kind of detail thereand a snap closure you have your sidepockets right here on both sides andthis nice adjustable strap it's not longenough to do crossbody on me but it'slong enough to be nice shoulder lengthbut can also be used as top handle andit has a nice leather trim as well sovery cute bag very sporty casual I likeit so I guess with my 30% off I paidprobably about $40 after-tax neste got Ifound another one I they use this lugmini Puddle Jumper in pink my favoritecolor this one was kind of expensivethis one I flipped a tag off was $49.99so again I paid $40 after taxes umthis bag is constantly sold out onlineyou can never find it online and whenyou do it goes like that so they're kindof hard to come bybut they are cheap online they retailfor $49.99 but they're always on salefor 25 but like I said you can nevergrab it so the last one I had I resoldfor I paid cheaper though I'm not sure Itake about the same yeah I think I paidabout $40 for two but I think I resoldit for 60 65 so I made $25 on it so I'mfun I might keep it I don't know I meanit's like that ugly ex-boyfriend thatwon't leave you alone keeps coming backto you it's back in my life again it'llmonster magnet of it but there's so manycompartments this makes an excellenteveryday bag it's probably big enough toeven be a gym bag you can put like yourshoes or clothes in here it is so ohactually there is a place there it is$49.99 minus 30% off very roomy insidemultiple compartments pockets so manyplaces to put things you know a reallynice bag it's a cute color so don't knowif I want to keep it don't know if Iwant to sell it the last bag I boughtever yeah it's not real hold yourselfit's not real I purchased it becausenumber one of the price so I ripped thisone I ripped the price I got this onewas 399 is only 4 bucks but it's madeout of real leather I know real leatherand this is real leather so no we'refirst number one nowhere on the bag isit's a Chanel so it's I mean it is itdoes say CC but it doesn't say Chanelanywhere on the bag so it's not exactlya replica or a knockoff I guess let'scall a spade a spade right anyway allthe quilting lines up which is nice thebottom the stitching is really nice Imean the the handles are substantialwhich is funny because this looks likean older made knockoff of that bag of aChanelum camera bagthe chains are heavy on my when I usedto own the Chanel flap the chains werelight they weren't heavy at all so Idon't know if they changed it I don'tknow if it used to be heavy now it'slight I don't know if it's just a modelstyle my flap who knows but these chainsare substantial and and heavy so seeI'll show you the inside there is onecondition condition there's onecondition issue with it is that thelining is kind of coming out like notribbed but like the stitching had comeoff and it's kind of separating see butI mean it's not torn and it's not youknow ripped so I wonder if that can befixed but regardless doesn't reallyaffect the usage of the bag anyway andthe inside is made out of actual realleather too so I mean whoever made thisbag was trying to make a good qualitybag so it's like a nice kind of a nokinda like a no an untreated nice likeleather it has one zip pocket which Iprobably wouldn't use but yeah I mean ifyou want the look for less there you goI think it's cute I mean I think it'sactually really well-made not extremelywell-made like a real Chanel butwell-made enough to be a bag that youuse just sometimes I don't get having aknockoff bag because then you know likewhat if someone not not that someonecalled you out on it but someone can belike oh I love your bag where'd you getit from I need be like it's not real sothen you're kind of like put on the spotnow or you can lie and say it's real butI mean what kind of person does thatmake you a friend er a liar a wannabe Imean it makes you a lot of things rightanyway I got that just because you knowI just wanted to see what it was likeand you know show you guys I fake welllike a Chanel camera bag look-alike andopens a pocket on the back as well it'slined and leather inside as well soI think the original of this is probablyabout three thousand dollars after taxesand boxes for phone 99no 399 so yeah don't know if I'm goingto use it don't know if I'm gonna giveit away probably give it away cuz Iwouldn't wear it just because I mean youknow if I'm wearing this bag and somewas like oh I love this Chanel bagwhere'd you get it fromI got it from by village and I paid $4per day it's not real I'm obsessed withBooster Juice seriously I think there'sa tropical hurricane smoothie is so goodI had like a super booster chia seed umshot to it I also had their wheatgrassshot I don't know why people are so likethey think we grass shots are sodisgusting it's not really thatdisgusting granted it does taste likegrass and granted it leaves anaftertaste

allat once and a piece of jewelry so it'sobviously gold but it has a fishtaildesign with pave diamonds inthey're on the fresh-kill and I justthink it's so elegant and so classy Iget the most compliments when I wear itbecause it's a really unique piece ofjewelry I think hand chains are so ontrend and on the other three pieces thatI'm wearing I think we're all so funalessandra ambrosio's collection andthey're on my body right now so thefirst guess is dainty necklace i lovethis i really like dainty necklaces ifi'm not going to wear a statementnecklace and I don't have any like verysimple thin chain necklaces because Ihave a thin gold train which I thinkwhat's really sexy and brings attentionto your cleavage and Eckhart way if youdon't have any cleavage like myself butit also has the horn pendant withcrystals and then a few crystals on theside here so it's a little bit jazzed upbut it's still very simple and elegantand classy and from afar so again thiswas something that I saw on her and Iwas like oh my god I'm sold but I reallythink under the Torah secret angel butI'm not but I'm the cool thing is everyseason baublebar actually have a guestbartender so I celebrity a model ofcourse this time with alessandraambrosio and they come and create acollection or have a selection ofjewelry that they have picked out in adifferent section and then I also pickedup some rings because for war has anamazing selection of stackable rings andinteresting rings and raising somethingI were all the time you guys alwaysasking about these mini rings that I'mwearing and so the first one I picked upis this two finger ring here the rightis very thin itself and very delicatewhich I love because you can still wearrings on other fingers without thisbeing overbearing but it's basically asnake design for the tails on one fingerand then the head loops up on your otherfinger and there's some pave diamonds inthere too which is really nice but Ilove this piece again I'm wearing on mymiddle two fingers but I also worn it onmy first two before which I also like todo i do believe that this is also fromalessandra collection i will doublecheck but what's so we own this it's onthe website there's actually a sectionbelow where regular people basicallypost their Instagram pictures andhashtag them and you can see how peoplewear them and staff call the jewelry sothat also really helped me decidebecause I've seen people stack this withthis ring also that I'm wearing as wellthis is a another snake ring but this isrose gold and rose gold is my favoritejewelry metal of all time and so I haveto have it and this one is just a coilring and it's another perfect stackablering so it's all thesetogether and also I thought with thehand hey and I was like I need all thesepieces in my life because rings are justI just get my stacking ring game up sothat's what I chose from bauble bar Iwill leave links to everything that Ichose down below I'm actually go inahead and making my own personal orderwith bauble bar because I really lovethe stuff and I love the quality Ibelieve you guys links as well to thethings that I'm going to go ahead andpurchase with my own money to if youguys are interested down below and ofcourse if you want to try anything takeadvantage of my discount code which willbe in the info bar because who doesn'twant to save some money but yeah and inlove with all my new jewels so that'swhere I got them the next thing that Igot are all clothing items and shoes soI'm going to start with jeans becausejeans are basic but this is something Iget asked about all the time these jeansare from hollister that I picked up thisis a pair of skinny jegging jeans fromhollister and in my nighttime routinevideo i think it was i wore another pairof these jeans and kid you not i got somany compliments about people tellingthem how great they look to my body andasking where they're from and the bestpart about these jeans are they aretwenty-five dollars to twenty ninedollars when they go on promo they are athinner denim but they literally fit thebody so nicely if you like a gene thatfits your body tight and hugs yourcurves which is me personally i like myjeans to be kind of second skin and theykind of make you less a bright tone tomake your butt look lifted and good thisis it I swear you don't need to spendlike two hundred dollars on jeansbecause these fit me better than somedesigner jeans do or just as well I weara three regular and this is just amedium in dedham color and I also happylight denim ones and so I figured Iwould show them because i still gotcomments with this very day of peoplesaying oh my god i love those jeans theni did actually go ahead and purchaseanother pair of jeans i wanted whitejeans this entire summer but I justhaven't found one of the AI like or beatthat fit me really nice and they have tobe that stretchy material too becauseI'm the kind of girl that would ratherwear sweats than jeans because I findthem to be pretty uncomfortable at timesso I found these ones they are a littlebit more pricey there with the hollisterjeans these are by ragam bone and theseare just their classic skinny jeans Ifigured I would splurge on them they fitme really really nicely when I triedthem on and they were on sale they arejust a classic white jean they have norips or anything in them because I justlike plain ones and if anyone'sinterested Ibesides 25 because they were verystretchy they feel like they're gonnastretch out a lot so yeah I wouldtotally buy back and bone jeans againjust because I do like how these onesfit but again I'm quite as happy with myhorse or $25 jeans I don't thinkeverything needs to be overpriced nexttime i purchased two of the same thingsthese are from urban outfitters theirtwo tops I've been having the hardesttime finding talks lately and so when Ifind something I tend to buy it in twocolors or every color just because Idon't know what I'm going to findanother top that I like to wear so Ifound this talk you guys have seen thisin my vacation and lookbook this isbasically a gorgeous tank top with laceand crochet detailing from UrbanOutfitters it is from any brand kimchiblue it's all cotton which is a big dealI love cotton tops in the summer I hatelike polyester and stuff and then when Iwas in Florida I went ahead and got itin the white as well because althoughthey look the same i feel like the whitehas a slightly different look I mean itdoesn't exactly look like the same top Imean maybe that's just my logic which iswhy I bought it but the game is veryversatile pieces and you can wear thesein the sum of its shorts or in the fallwith just long jeans and things likethat I also have some workout clothes toshow you or finish clothes becausehonestly when all else fails and I can'tfind real clothes to wear out I canalways find like a million workoutclothes and fitness clothes and sosometimes I just buy them so I end upgetting another pair of my favoriteunder armour compression short these arethe best compression shorts they reallyhold you in tight and nicely and theydon't write down they also do have alined cross which is really nice but Ido prefer these personally to the nikepros because they don't write upespecially if you have like no chunkythighs you have thigh meat like i do ifind the nike ones roll up and thiscollar was so neat as like orangiecolors and then also lululemon sucked mein and there's always dodge but I'vebeen doing so much better without goinginto that short because the stuff isjust so good so I picked up another oneof their swiftly tank top I believe Ishow needs in a few other colors in mylast workout hole and again this colorreally spoke to me it's like a brightpink with like undertones of forward Ireally recommend them they're expensivefor what they are when you think aboutit but they fit nicely they wash nicelyand they are sweat wicking and then Ibought something a little bit more fancyI guess if you can call with that sothis one I picked up it is called thedancing warrior tank top the front isjust like a head of graylike a little pattern on it nothingspecial he back is really really coolhow like that's twisted cross back andit goes down really low and if you guysknow me I love anything with a specialback and so this totally without myalley and I like the contrast of pig Igot it in a size 4 and i also bought theother top in a size 4 as well and thenfinally i got two pairs of shoes that ifigured i would show you guys the firstrow pair of sandals from michael korsagain i got asked questions about theseon my vacation look but these gonna beJaden flip-flop sandal and i love them ihad been looking for nice flat sandalsbecause obviously at this age i don'tnecessarily just want to worry about myflip-flops these are more classy withembellishments on them but thing i likeabout these two is that the bling isvery secure oh my calling a bling likebling language is this the 90s thejewels are really secure on the sandalthey're not just gonna flop off and ilove that these weren't too expensive ithink they were a hundred and somethingbecause sandal I don't care how youslice it and dice it you're going tohave to replace them sooner than like apump or something so I do want to spenda crazy amount of money on a sandal thatwill definitely get worn down and needto be replaced eventually it's just nota smart move for and then last but notleast I picked up a pair of Nikesneakers nike makes my favorite sneakersfor lifting and just for wearing outsidethe house these are the women's nikefree 5.0 + and i have these in anothercolor but i wanted to get another colorand I've been waiting for another car tocome out that I like and I go spend thistime any gray with a pink stripepresently I don't recommend these if youwant to do cardio because i find thesoul is very thin on them I don't likenike free's for cardio but for liftingthey're fine and of course they'recomfortable to wear but they also lookreally nice on the foot because i don'thave extremely small feet and they makemy feet look smaller and more dainty seea guy that is everything that I pickedup I didn't want to make this whole toolong because I am still searching forthings but I figure because you guyswant these clothing hauls I will just doa later run down the line and I can showyou guys the stuff that I pick up frombauble bar myself as well if you guysare interested just leave a commentbelow but I hope you guys enjoyed thisclothing hauls always so fun for mebecause I can

what's up guys Richard here welcome backto my Channel today I'm going to bedoing a haul video for you guys my firsthaul video so hope you guys like itcomment for more videos that you guyswant to see and subscribe to my channelso today I'm going to be doing a hotvideo from Lulu Lemon a lot of peoplethink that they don't make men'sclothing but they do so yeah hopefullyyou guys like the items that I'm showingyou today and if you guys like them goand buy yourself a pair cause youdeserve it ok i have three ABC pantsthat i want to show you guys first oneis like gray one this is actually myvery first pair of these pants so at thefront on the left side it has a littlesmall pocket for your phone our keys andthen a bigger pocket and then I'm onebig pocket on the right side over here Iuse this just for casual wear andsometimes working out but mainly forcasual wear is so comfortable verylightweight and its really really reallyreally nice looking too I have anotherpair this one's in the light green Ireally love green so I have to get thisonce I seen that they made it in thiscolor that's a small pocket a big pocketlike I said same thing just in adifferent color did I love public butinside has a good neon yellow littleline a little lining in there which Ilike um and I have a green pair of thedark green forest green polish kind ofcolor I really like this was so bad andI bought in the fall I believe not 2015great to the right I think I bought inactually 2015 but I really like itand it's so comfortable if you'relooking for a pair of new pants for likeany hiking or working out just casual irecommend this so so much it's socomfortable you're not going to regretit hopefully you don't because I reallylove them the next one is a kind of likea thicker pant it still feels kind ofthin it has a double lining in it whichI really like so when it's like reallyreally cold out you don't really feel itI don't feel anything when it's so coldso that's why I really like these pantsand again they're so comfortable and ithas more pockets than the ABC pant whichis even a plus and the prices are reallyreally similar like maybe like less thanfive dollar difference or something butI got this likely five years ago andthey're still going strong thank Godbecause these are my favorite pants alsoso on the right side it has like azipper pocket here and on the right sidetop it has just like a regular openedpocket this side has a good velcropocket here on the left side and then ithas the top big pocket and then anothersmall pocket just like the ABC pant andon the back has two velcro loop pocketsokay and then like I said this is adouble lining pants so it's going tokeep you really warm and that's the bestpart about these pants because that'slike the main point of these pants tokeep you warm and that's why we'repaying so much for it and actually worksand this is little draw strings that itcomes with and it's in the color blackthey do have other colors but I don'tknow what they have now but I know thatthey have obviously different colorsthis was my kind of recent purchase I'mafter Christmas time I got myself a pairof these for my own Christmas presentthese are the seawall track pant 2.0 orsomething oh my god in a light gray theyalso had a black but they didn't have mysize andso I was just like okay fine I'll justput the gray ones but it still looksreally really nice i like how it hasthis like stripe design on it or becausesee that again it's so comfortable thisis also a double lining Pantuso that'swhy i got it and now that we obviouslywere in the winter time I do need adouble lined pair see how it looks likethis inside it has to draw stringsinside as well then the lining is Ithink it's always gonna be black so yeahand let me show you the pocket it's onlytwo front ones a little bit sad butwhatever it has two big pockets here oneach side and then there's actually ohoh I don't even know this till nowthere's a small pocket in the big pocketit's kind of hard to tell on cameraagain but it's hiding in there and theback looks like this there's two pocketsthey're not developers if they're justopened which kind of sucks but whateverthat's what they did with this one whichis not that bad I don't really use theback pockets anyway so it doesn't reallybother me next one I have like a sweaterhoodie type of jacket it's very thinlightweight when it keeps me reallyreally warm this one is great forobviously casual wear running or evenlike working out in if you want to sweatmore purposely it has a pocket here whatthe zipper which I like I really likethat it has it on both sides very herefor to tell what is it rare but yeah andit has a popwhere is it actually no never mind Ithought I'd had a pocket here but notthis one and it also has a drawstringwhich is great and the hoodie isactually like a raincoat material as youcan hear from that it's really reallythin lightweight and so comfortable it'smy favorite the next one I'm going toshow you all tops now this one is araincoat doesn't have a hardon fine thisone is camouflage black jacket you guyscan see that on camera I really lovecamo as you can tell from my Herschelbanc review and I really really lovedanything like dark green forestycamouflage like for example where's myphone where's like oh here I'll show youguys my phone my phone case i reallylove camo and this is really link heavyduty feeling and it even has like astand here so whenever you're likeeating breakfast or something oranywhere you can always watch stuffwhile you're sitting out didn't work forsomething and yeah so this one is acolored jacket raincoat it has a pockethere wait oh I didn't know this till nowand I had this for like a year orsomething but hey wait it has like alittle poppy here and you could I'm openup the sides of your jacket so you canget more air flow in it the back is likea thin stretchy material just the backand it has to pop kids just like one oneach side of the jacket and it's thepockets are zippered not like velcro ornot just open which is really reallygoodand sorry the wrist is stretchy so ifyou guys like that then I highlyrecommend it this is my two favoritehoodies these two next items I'll startwith one and I don't know the names forthem because I had it for so long andthey don't make this one anymore butyeah this is my favorite hoodie I prettymuch wear this like it's my jacketbecause it's that warm it's really thickand it has a neon yellow zipper in themiddle and also on the back hood it hasthe lulu logo and also neon and it has adrawstring that the front which i reallyreally like to and it has this frontpocket and it has a button and same withthe side pockets they're both button popkids it's kind of hard to tell on camerabecause the color of this hoodie is likepretty dark but yeah it looks like thisinside all neon inside which I reallylike yeah and it's so warm it's so thickwhenever it snows I don't even feel coldbecause that's how they can warm it isfor me and it has another zipper hereand that's just to carry more stuff inyour arm hook up kind of weird that theyput that there cuz it's kind of likeawkward but yeah um this one I can'tremember the name I have to figure thatout once i find out what the name was isbut yeah and this one is another Luluhoodie also grey graze my favorite colorfor honeys I don't know the name forthis one either because again i had thisfor so long i had this for like fiveyears or something and it has a pockethere on the side that one is opened itwas she was close but it's notwhatever this one is also open the sidepocket and it has like a little pocketthe front at the bottom sorry and it'szipper which I liked so I put likechange in there like whenever I go buysomething just put the receipt in thereor something and then the front hereit's done zipper obviously but it hastwo buttons so you can cover like theneck area just so like you got moreprotected by like the wind or somethingand sometimes I like covers you reallyreally well like it's a scarf itactually does so that's why I like thatand again the Lulu logo hope you can seethat hard to tell but that's that butanyways that's my haul video

just looks so great onthis jacket is adorable yeah so thesecond thing I got was this this is thescuba 3 jacket I believe or sweatshirtand this is what it looks like this isway heavy-duty compared to this jacketso this is more like a workout jacketthese two I bought online when I wasbuying this one I'm like well I do justbuy this one but this one is very thinit's not it's something more like of aspring kind of thing or to wear to thegym until you get hot this is more likeheavy duty jacket look this the symbolson the hood it's so cute it's reallyheavy-duty super cute it has the bigsymbol on the front the Lululemon symboland it is so comfortable it's just likereally nice specially in Minnesota wherewe have like really weird Springs orreally weird Falls that it's coldsomedays and not cold

planning on getting super sweaty oranything like I want to get more ofthese actually cuz they're really reallyreally comfortable and just have likethe cutest I just took the tag offbecause I know I'm not returning it theyjust have the cute they just fit sonicely and the way that this material isit's so it's totally worth itokay second or third thing I got isthese wonder unders wonder under cropthreeI just got black I have no black wonderunders I have two other three other pairof wonder unders ones green ones grayand one is like a gray stripe one and Ididn't have any black and I really loveblack workout pants are just so basicyou can't go wrong with a black workoutpants I do have some Under Armour onesbut these just fit so well I only wearmy wonder unders now because they arejust so comfortableum and last thing I got that I have toshow you guys I'll show you the sportsbras that I ordered don't mind my shirtis these pants oh my god they're so cutethey're so ridiculously expensive butthey're so cute these are tight stufftight tight stuff tight yeah okay sothis is what they look like they are redthey look way better on camera than inperson and then here's the bottom haslittle scalloped ends and then it has ifyou can see gold dots all over and thenon the side it has the Under Armour logooh these are so cute I just I I thinkbecause okay so there has a zipper inthe back this is what I like about himand I'll tell you if you can see righthere it has a stitching on the side ofthe butt and the reason I like that isit makes your butt look smallerso the wonder unders don't have that thewonder under just has you know just aregular but it has no stitching on thesides of the but this these make yourbot look so great so because of this itkind of squeezes your butt and makes theillusion of your butt being smaller thanwhat it is so these are amazing they arepretty spendy but in my opinion I've hadmy wonder unders and my other Lululemonstuff forever and for that reason Ialways will buyjust because to me they're totally worththe money so yeah okay um I also got twobras one bra is exactly like this thisis the free to be sports bra and this isnot what I got but this is

you had a 20-year career I had a 20-yearcareer I'm a Starbucks I did how do youexplain the success of Starbucks ah Ireally think it's a unique combinationof Howard Schultz's personality andvision for life and and his passion tocreate something that was big and alegacy and to really transform purposeand then he had a great combination oftwo other people that worked with himHoward Bihar who was all about thepeople and Orrin Smith who was allaround business strategy and workingwith the three of them was probably oneof the greatest gifts that I got as abusiness leader because I really learnedto be well-rounded from vision andpurpose led strategically andfinancially led and how to do it throughpeople so that was really a great giftin my career expand on that a little bitI think he did use the term vision forlife what does that mean I think all ofus in life want a sense of belonging into know that we're getting up and makinga difference and you know I will evenbringing all of yourself to work and ifthere's a difference between who you areand your values and how a companyoperates you're always holding somethingback and what I think Howard and what Ilearned from him which was such a giftwas that and Howard be her as wellbecause he has this phrase job's bigenough for people that when the work youdo have is purpose lead and it's full ofpassion and that people actually belongto the company and it's vision asopposed to just coming in and doing ajob you do your best work and that's oneof the most important lessons that Ilearned from that leadership team thechief executives broadcasting live onthe SFU BT School of Business on CK NW,22,UCDFgYuR6bb7VJIhQ9YAfmTQ,CKNW980,0,1,0,3,"['christine day', 'lululemon', 'ceo', 'chip wilson', 'active wear', 'clothes', 'yoga', 'cknw', '980', 'chief executives', 'bill good', 'radio', 'Clothing (Industry)']","Christine Day, CEO, Lululemon - Working at Starbucks",fjXFFxXLTUw,1396
hey guys I am back with a Lululemon haulI think I don't know if I tweet it orsomething somehow I mentioned that Iwasn't hauling my Lululemon stuff latelybecause I just got a lot of negativefeedback about it in the past and youknow I have to show you guys everythingif it's gonna make you upsetoh um bye to you bad people like showplease show and I just did like a hugelumen haul for winter running gear Ijust I mean this is like huge I investeda lot of money in this stuff but thething with Lululemon is it has lasted mepersonally forever um my haven't boughtnew Lululemon yoga stuff in yearsbecause I still have in like excellentcondition the yoga pants and tops that Ibought five six seven years ago and I'mstill using them every time and they'refine so I don't need to be purchased soI'm expecting these things to last mefrom year to here and I just I reallyneeded some high-quality running stufffor winter and that's basically whatthis is so there's a couple things thataren't necessarily for running and I'llpoint those things out but yes I did endup buying a lot of things right so I'mjust a I started I you know this isstuff I bought over the course of thepast month or so some things online somein store so I'm just gonna I haven'tpick up on the pack of mine I justfilled my Birchbox but uh I'm gonna jumpright in so I stumbled across thesegloves and now of course I don't havethe tags in them I've been wearing themfor weeks I don't remember what they'recalled but I'll write down right herewhat they're called there are these Ibasically think of them as liner glovesor they're gloves you can wear on theirown when it's like 40 maybe 45 degreesor a little bit warmer around 40 degreesand you've you warm enough I knowthey're like super soft but the thingthat attracted me to them was they haveon the finger pads these like hot spotsI'm not really sure what they're calledbut I call them hot spots and basicallywhat it means is when you're wearingyour clubsee if I can demo this and you'reoutside here's my iPhone right you can Idon't know that was you can still liketouch things and with gloves on you'regonna take your gloves off so thesethings are just like awesome cometotally in handy and basically about twopairs because the black ones I use everyday when I'm walking my dog and I walkher twice a day winter no winter rain orshine well not if it's really rainingbecause she's a white dog after all butum and when it's really coldI wear mittens over them so they act asliners and when I take my mitten off tolike you know do things where I need myfingers I'm still protected and I canstill use my phone and stuff so I reallylike these and I also bought a pair justfor running and I actually think I mightgo buy an additional pair so I have twopairs for running because I only do mylaundry once a week and I do like thosekind of like I don't know if this is toomuch information I do like rub my facein my nose and stuff when I'm runningoutside especially in the winter it'slike you know I don't know if you runoutside in the winter you know what Imeanand they get dirty and so that's why Ijust might want to buy another pairgoing along with that I actually haveone of these already that I thought whenI found these gloves but I boughtanother one in my recent online purchasethis is the women's risk run toque it'sreversible and it's got this little holein the back where your ponytail comesout and what I like about this I don'tknow if you can tell by the detailing itcomes down farther than other run hacksI've seen it's a thick but soft andbreathable material I've been wearing itfor the past few weeks on my outdoorruns and it's been cold and so you flipit inside out it's the same thing so youcan like swap it outI bought you because again I get sweatyand I don't like to I will do laundrymore than onceso it's nice to have a couple of theseum this has been really nice it's beenjust as all that I need and on thereally really cold days I just pull Iput on a shirt or a jacket with a hoodieand I'll wear this under pot but thishas been sufficient so far and it's justthe perfect amount of warmth for my headwhen I'm running so those have beenreally nice additions I also justreceived this in the mail this is thewomen's arctic run headband and it'salso reversible you can see this side isreally fuzzy I don't know if you cantell it's so soft it feels like a teddybear couple of Lululemon insignia andthen you can flip it around and have itbe this book so maybe this is for thedays when you don't need your whole headcovered they still need something and Ijust like to have it with a little bitwider around where your ears are andit's got a bit of elastic to it so itstretches so that's kind to keep my headwarm which is nice um running runningrunning I bought another pair of theWonder underpants which are basicallytheir basic liking it's made out oftheir missing it's tapers down at theends into a classic legging I wear size6 in their pants it's called the perfectno fuss pant from yoga to gym to lifeit's it's like a second skin I bought myfirst pair a few months ago I love themthey're incredibly supportive they'regreat for sort of mild day runs likewhen it's just maybe 40 degrees arearound 40 35 to 45 maybe they're perfectand I love that I've been wearing thecrops like I wear the Wonder under cropsearlier in the fall and it was more like40 50s you know that sort of temperatureum they're really comfortable they don'tchafe I do have to get all the pants Iorder from them hands because they makethings super long but I don't mindbecause it's free and even when you buyonline you just take them right to thestore they'll either measure you or youcan measure yourself and just pin themup where you want them doneit only takes them like four four daysor so and you get them back and they'rebeautifully hemmed you didn't have topay for it so I got another pair ofthose to have on hand so I have two ofthose total and then I bought two oftheir they just released for this yearthe run for it tight this is theirwinter running tight so it's actuallygot the zipper detail on the front withreflectorsI don't mind other factors and thosezippers are like a nice detail but forsomebody who has like larger legsit's not the most ideal place to put azipper right on the thighs like thatbut honestly they're actually moreflattering than I thought they would beso I'm not out there to like win anybeauty fashion running awards but I justthey're like double insult insulated letme read you what it says high risethermal running tights will give you thewarm and fuzzies made with super softand breathable tech fleece for ultimatemuscle control and moisturemuscle support and must end oh my goshfor ultimate muscle support and moisturecontrol so I have not tried these yetbut I did try them on and I am veryenthusiastic about them and again Ibought two pairs just so I mean I'm kindof assuming this is what I'm gonna wearwhen it's like super cold up so I don'thave to do the laundry twice and it isreally really cold out I'd probably runa warm-up pant over them dependingdepending on the conditions okay then Ihave a lot of they're like kind of undertops like base layers and I have a fewof their mid layers that are moreappropriate for fall or spring but Iwanted it a couple of mid layers thatwe're more appropriate for the reallycool time so this is another thing fromtheir run for it line it's looks blue oncamera it's purple it's like very purpleit's this kind of pullover jacket it'snot just like asymmetrical zipper I'mnot sure about this yeah and this hoodthe hood is actually really nice itactually is a spot for your ponytail tocome out again so your hair's not likesquished against your headand it fits very nicely it's like it's aclose fit but it's not too snug so it'sa nice hood this is interesting how I'mprobably try to solve it it's justcomfortable so when it unzips it unzipslike let's see asymmetrically and thenit's got this like snuff you can snap itopen so it gives you more room for yourneck to breathe or you can zip it allthe way up and it's basically like givesyou um because when you're writing youdon't really want a lot around your neckeven if it's really cold but it's niceto have some protection so this is areally nice mid layer then again it'smade from that stuff that the run for ittights are made of it says run for itand reach for your goals this coat inthis cozy body's giving mid layerwicking tech fleece is brushed on theinside for warmth and comfort body mapwith anti stink circle mesh bed panelsfor extra movement long fun set for easyon off blah blah blah oh and this isreally cute I really really love all mylittle um and stuff that they call thesecuff ins where it's got the thumb holeright this is your sleeve where your armgoes through the coffins are when thesleeves come over your hand into a fistso I don't have running mittens yetsomething I have yet to invest in butwhat I do is I'm wearing my littlerunning gloves right and if it's reallycold I'll just put my coffin over myhand like pretend my pulls arms in thereand this is really cute it actually sayswarm warm heart and then says cold handson the other one that's just a cutedetail but this is like the perfectrhyming mitten built right in and a lotof my other mid layers have them andI've been really really enjoying thatso that doesn't guys haven't had to goout and buy any buddy mittens but I'mprobably going to get some just better alittle more like storm troops I guess soI haven't I know I try this on it wasn'tmy favorite fit but some mid layers soI'm gonna try it we'll see howgoes then I got some really warm thingsI basically well this is another midlayer which could also be an outer layeron maybe less cold days it's this downpull over you can see it's got it's athicker blue one or whatever they calltheir material this is what the thickerversion of it on the arms but on thesides it's where you tend to get likereally hot and you want to release youknow some air when you're running evenwhen it's cold out let's see what theysay this is called the run insulatorpullover where is the mid or outerlayers like I said this pullover givesyou weightless insulation for longwinter runs 650 fill power premium goosedown for warmth and loft pretension meshof feathers and goose down providesnatural warmth stretchy inherentlywicking and breathable Lulu apparentlythat's what this stuff's called fabricpanels don't fit all thumb holes keepsleeves down blah blah blah um soapparently this like other stuff calledLulu who know uh I just really liked howit was is so lightweight but is stilldown and it's got this awesome like neckcollar detail put these snaps so you canbutton it all the way up or leave itopen and it's easy to do while you're onthe run literally and it's just reallycozy but it's also easy to move in andthat's what I liked about the Lululemonstuff I did look at other brands for myloop winter running gear but came backto LAas usual they impressed me with theirquality and their designs lastly Iwanted a winter jacket for runningspecifically and I wanted one that waslightweight that covered you know wentdown past my bum a little bit but not somuch that interfere with my leg movementso like mid bum and I saw this actuallyin the store and I said that's it and Idon't know if you can tell on camerait's this beautiful like eggs very darkeggplant color and it's actuallyreversible and the other side of it is ahighly reflectiveit's a highly reflective material now Inormally wear a four in Lululemon topsbut when it comes to mid or outer layersI go up a size to a six because I don'twant these to be so tight especiallywinter things we're going to be packingthese things on one on top of the otheron a certain cold day so this is calledthe run turnaround jacket reversed andreflective in this weightless coldweather outer layer 650 fill powerPremium goose down for warmth and loftretention mesh of feathers in goose downprovides natural warmth stretchyinherently wicking and breathable Lulufabric panels houndstooth ripstop has adurable water repellent finish toprotect from light wind and raineffective visibility details forlow-light visibility this is it this isexactly what I wanted it's a bit longbut not too longit comes down about mid bum just like Isaid it's got vent zippers on the sideso if you get hot you just unzip those alot of eve here has that kind of thing Iknow my skin coats to see coach I haveone coat it's really light it's likelight as a feather but it's warm and itwas pricey but again this is a boat it'sgonna last me a long time and it'ssomething I could wear you know everyday if I wanted to when you're runningthough you don't need quite as one thingis when you're not running because youcreate a lot of heat just by themovement so that probably wouldn't bewarm enough for like every day walkingaround whinnies and stuff but I couldwear it under my jacket as a nice midlayer just for walks and stuff then I'vegot some stuff that is not right relatedI have like a million of these now andby a million I mean - this is thetravelpod seven apparently I think Ishowcase one of these in the Lululemonwhile I did earlier this year maybe thissummer Springs uh my dog walking patchwhich I love and I use I used all summerand for most of the fall and I'm gonnapick back up with it and the lace whenit warms up again um I like the cliparound ones when I'm not wearing coatslike clip around your waistwell when I'm wearing a jacket I wantthe kind that are like a messenger bagand I might do a video on like some ofmy favorite dog walking stuff on what hewas due to at some point but like justso much I wanted to have one that wasblack that other ones like grey and kindof like patterns that I could take ontrips with me to be like a travel bagand I don't know if you can tell butit's got this very pretty close topattern it's very understated and prettyit's light it's got great pockets insidefor storage it's got a zipper pocketthree mesh pockets this is very likeholds a lot about another zipper pocketon the back side that would be closestto your body and yet another zipperpocket in the front so it holds a lotit's got a lot of compartments which isgreat and I thought this specificallywith like amusement parks in mind andI'm going to Disney World is amaze youyou know at the end of Februarybeginning of March for thee princesshalf marathon but then we're alsospending a week there as our vacationthis will be excellent there but I couldalso see using it like as a tourist yourcamera in your phone and your money andeverything you need and have it likeright around you you know that's rightand I just bought some at winter cozyso first off I talked about thissweatshirt I don't know was it in myNovember favorites yeah I think so thisis the cuddle up jacket I bought anotherone and I'm going to tell you why againin black this is like their new versionit's the detailing on the Front's alittle different and it's got that sameyou pilot can't see it that same fuzzystuff that's on the headband that Ishowed you earlier in this video aroundthe neck I bought this for you toss toleave in Utah and to also be for skiinga mid layer for skiing it's just warmenough it's like a really niceheavyweight sweatshirt but it's not likeyou can't move in it I wear mine all thetime and what I like about it for skiingis that um it's like not too tightaround your neck it's so cozy with thespiky stuff but it provides kind of likea scarf like thing without having towear a scarf and when I ski I wear aturtle which is like this fleece circlebasically that goes around your neck andthen you just pull it up as far as youwant on your face and that would fitperfectly under this and this would fitperfectly over that and just be a nicecombination for like really chilly daysand I think it's too warm I can justunzip this a bit and of course I have myski jacket on top of this and my facelayer underneath it and maybe anotherone if it was really cold but that's whyI wanted this basically for skiing andthen because I love their sweat pants Ibasically live in them and they justreleased these this year I don'tremember him having these before or Iguess I missed them these are the cuddleup pant too so they must have had thembefore because these are the secondgeneration the coziest pants layer theseover tights on extra chilly Jays doingfrom the gym and yellow studio thickwarm cotton fleece is pre shrunkenmachine washable it's the same materialas that jacket so it's this nice veryhigh-quality stick sweat pant muchthicker than any of my other Lululemonsweat pants like all the cuff up becausethey're like huge and I have to havethemhamed but they're so warm and cozy and Ijust think they'd be really nice tolounge in when I'm cold and like I saidwith all the pants I have to take themin to get hemmed but I always wash themfirst I know I'm keeping them so that'snot a big deal for mebut I'm going to wash them and I neverput any of my Lululemon stuff in thedryer with the exception of a couple oflike the scuba sweatshirts I'll put inthe dryer for a little bit but only onlike extra care low heat or whatever buteverything else in the lemon I hang dryI just there are nice quality thingsthat I want them to last so I'm gonnawash these and then take them into thehemmed and have them right get them backhopefully right before we go to Utah uhand that is my winter little

hey everyone so today I have anotherhope for you I did a lot more damage tomy wallet and i know i just postedanother rather large hall this wasreally not expected at all but you knowwhat it happened so we might as welljust embrace it and be excited about thethings that i got maybe i don't know umit's really not so much stuff but ifigured i might as well show it to youbecause it's kind of interesting and iwant to show you before i put it awayand forgot about it so yeah let's getinto it so the first door that I went tois one of my favorites and that isbrandy melville and I only got twothings from there I got two or threethings I got two shirts and one cardiganthe first shirt that I got is what I'mwearing and it's just a gray flowy tanktop and has are racerback and what Ilike about it is the arm holes arereally low so if you wear bra let youcan see like through the armpits and Ijust think it's really cute and I likeso much that I got the same shirt andwhite that's what it looks like deeparmpit hose and they're really cute andthese are both $14 and then the cardiganthat I got is this it's just a deepmaroon color and it's a bit longer thanall the other cardigans I have it goesjust passed your bum so I think it looksreally cute with really short shorts andthen a crop top and then some converseis just such a cute outfit cardigans arebasically a staple in my wardrobe Iliterally go nowhere without a cardiganI don't ever really wear jackets becausein California where I live it's justreally hot so there's not really anyreason for you to have any warm layersso cardigans are perfect and they justmake an outfit I feel and they're justso easy and really cute so that's what Igot it brandy melville and the next doorI went to with Lululemon's and I love mesimply loose so if there's ever a placethat has a little lemon store you bestbelieve I'm going to be walking out thatstore with Eliasone or two items so the first thing igot was a tank or a sports bra and thisis what it looks like i have the sameone in a lighter pink but i did losesome weight so that's exciting but ineeded to get a smaller size becauseother things shrunk as well so i gotthis it's just black it crosses in theback but with this really cute detailingand i just love this and this is calledthe energy broad and this wasforty-eight dollars and the cardigan was$52 i don't remember if i said that ornot and then i also got this shirt whichI'm super excited about because I'vebeen wanting the shirt for a long time Ijust didn't now I wanted to spend themoney on it because it is kind ofexpensive for just a long sleeve shirtbut I caved so this is what it lookslike it's just a really cute like Idon't know a bright peachy coral itmakes you look really tan when you wearit and it has long sleeves and it has alittle some holes which lululemon isfamous for or I don't know if they'refamous for but all of their long sleeveshave the little thumb holes which iskind of cute and this is called the runswiftly tech LS scoop um that is a longname this I got in a size 4 and it was$68 stone it is kind of pricey but it'smade out of the same material that Ihave a bunch of my other lululemon tanktops and I love this material it's justso breathable and it's really comfy andit basically feels like you're notwearing a shirt at all so that's alwayscool because who doesn't like beingnaked and I got to like little accessorythings I got another one of theirheadbands and i love these headbands ourreward so I took off the tags I thinkthey're called the flying tamersLily they're like twelve dollars and soit's not a bad price for headbands andwhat I love about them is that they havethese like sticky things on the insideof the headband that like touches yourhair and it just helps to hold back allof your little flyaway wispy things andif you're like memight have a issue with that when you'reworking out so that's why this isperfect so I have like five of these andI kind of a weird thing to be showingbut I got underwear I love the littlelemon underwear for working out itliterally feels like you're not wearinganything so again being naked whodoesn't like feeling make it down therewhen you're working out and this iscalled the light as air and it's justlike a thong but it has like no seams oranything and this was sixteen dollarscuz so kind of expensive for underwearbut definitely worth it so I also placean order at both lulu's calm and Tobycalm and I just got one dress from Tobycalm and this is what it looks like itis a sweetheart neckline and it fitstight and it just sounds like reallycute scalp detailing at the bottom and Ijust thought this would be really funfor one of the events that I'm going toand then the last two that I'm about toshow you i got from lulu's so the firstone is this and it's just a really cutemint green shift dress it has likethree-quarter length sleeves and thenit's all open on the side so yourshoulder like and through your elbowit's all exposed and it's just reallycute and I think it was wrong on fiftydollars and the last dressed i showedyou is also still online and i thinkthat was around 40 ish dollars and thenthe last dress i got is definitely at myfavorite it's just a black tight dressand it has this beautiful lace detailingat the top so it fits you like a highneckline and then it ties in the backand then the back of the dress is reallylow I am just obsessed with this and Ibelieve I had this in black white andred so you're interested I would highlyrecommend this it's so so so flippingadorable and the last few items that Igot are all swimsuits and I got allthese off of victoria secret calm or inthe store I actually just placed anorder off of frankies bikinis calm for aswimtalk and that should be coming in themail soon ish so if you're interestedjust let me know and I will for sureshow that to you in an upcoming videocuz i know for me at least shopping offof that website was kind of confusing soyeah just let me know if you'reinterested let enemy time these are theones that I got on Victoria's Secret andI just got one swimsuit top and this iswhat it looks like it's hot pink it kindof looks like the bando because it haslike a thicker band at the bottom but ithas the halter straps at the top that'shigh and the straps aren't removable soyou can't really wear this as a band ohit's just kind of a basic top but whatmakes it different are the littlescalloped edge detailing at the top andat the bottom so it just makes it alittle bit more fun and feminine yeahdoes cover your boob a little bit morebut it's still flattering and cute so Iloved that and this was 3650 and then ibought these swimsuit bottoms to go withthe swimsuit top that i ordered off ofFrankie's and I just blocked that theyhave the little strap detailing on theside and then the next two bottoms aredefinitely more cheeky and they're thesame just in different colors and thisis what this one looks like um it justhas like this thicker band which i thinkis really flattering and then the backhas the ruching of the buttcrack so itjust hugs your butt and which makeseverything look really voluptuous andgood and I love these I think these arecalled the hit or the cheeky hip kinis iorder these online i think there werelike eighteen dollars i'm not too badand then i also got them in this neonyellow lime green color and i am reallyexcited to wear those because some daysyou just feel like being reallyrevealing and scandalous and the lastthing that i bought our shoes Idefinitely saved the best for last Imean these shoes when you see themyou'll hopefully die just like i didbecause they are gorgeous I mean justholding through these shoes now I feellike if I were to let them go I wouldmelt into little pieces because that isjust how pathetic and critical theseshoes are in my life and I am talkingabout new tory burch shoes I mean thebox itself is just 0piece of beautiful beautiful are you seejust know that was inside the box it'sgoing to be even better oh my gosh is soexciting they are gold Miller sandalsand these are just so perfect I fell inlove when I saw these and I have beenwanting a pair of sandals for such along time so it's caved finally anddecided to get them I just think they'regorgeous every jewelry piece i own iseither gold or rose gold because i thinkthat flatters my skin tone the most sothese were just a obvious choice and ijust love these when you're walking youget little hints of glimmer and it justmakes you so excited and happy to havethese on your feet these were definitelyexpensive so they set me back quite alot in regards to my bank account fundsbut you know what these are worth it andI'm just going to be happy that Ifinally have them and that's it thoseare all the things that I got recently Ihope

not going to do this youknow a ton i just kind of be likechecking in every once in a while and Ithought it'd be fun for people to kindof join in on my journey and we can kindof do it together so um a littlebackground um I'm not saying I'm fat oranything like that I think that you knowa positive body image is so important nomatter what you look like um but I havegained quite a bit of weight since highschool I went what from high school tonow I just graduated college I've gainedlike 20 25 pounds which is really crazyand hard for me to admit even but Ihaven't grown you know in that time soI've just kind of put on weight and it'snot something I'm just not happy withthe way that I look and how I feel andum you know I had really bad eatinghabits in college I can eat whatever Iwant I always kind of eaten whatever Iwanted which is part of the problem imean i've always been telling back nineso um i never played any sports who'snever liked the kid that like always isrunning around bricks differentactivities that's just not how I was asa kid I'd rather be like inside playingwith my dolls or something so um yeahand then when I went to college and mymetabolism started slowing down and Iwasyou know pizza two in the morning justit you know it's just happens so I'm Itried tried before to get into a fitnessroutine it just hasn't worked for me umbut now that I'm a little bit older andI

it's the zonincrop and then I got this bag to actuallyand then I got the tight so this is justthe same pant but in a longer versionand these are I think the color for thiswas forest green and then from the storeI got this tank top and bra combo whichwhen I bought it I actually did notrealize that it cut it detaches so whenI saw it in the store this was prettymuch attached to the tank top like thislike inside and it's got like the longerarmholes so you can kind of see the brafrom the side and I thought it was onepiece like that but when I was checkingout the girl I'm so glad told me thatthese there's like straps and you candetach the bra and then you can add onother bras so I actually have anotherbra here that's the same color schemeand it would actually go really reallyperfect with that so I'm so glad thatshe mentioned that I'm not exactly sureif I would figured that out but so I canwear the bras separately and or I canwear them together and I can mix imaginewhat they like and my favorite purchasefrom Lululemon is actually this hoodieand it has the thumb holes which Iabsolutely love and dis dis fits ona I'mso so nice it's the longer one is calledthe daily practice jacket and so it's itfits a little bit longer and Iabsolutely love the way it just hugs allyour curves and just enhances you in theright places I actually have this on Ithink in the video before last the onethat I did about how to start fitnessprogram and I absolutely absolutely lovethis I've been wearing it everywhere andthen let me will want Victoria Secret soI didn't do too much shopping at theVictoria Secrets I'm I Aine haul thishere because I had purchased a lot ofstuff from they're just regular shoppingin November December and in October justbecause I was into that whole fitnessthing and I was buying a lot of stufffrom there so I just ended up getting afew pieces online I didn't even bothergoing into the stores this year to lookI got this hoodie and I just loved thecolor and I have been eyeing this for awhile but I have a lot of hoodies so Idecided I wasn't going to get it butthen when I saw it on sale I absolutelyloved the color so I ended up getting itand then I also got this top right hereand this I love and half the thumb holesand then the really nice feature aboutit is that it has ain the back I don't know if you can tellbecause it's flat but there is a cutouthere so when you're wearing your sportsbra if it has like a cute strap in theback it shows so that's what pretty muchsold me on that but and then I have -pants - from there I forgot about thatand then I have these are the you knowthe proper name when you order stuffonline I feel like it doesn't come withthe tags that tells you what everythingis so this is just their sport legging Iguess and it has the V what is it v SS Xlogo on the side and the screen colorand these fit really really nicely I gotmine in the extra small I'm pretty muchan extra small from all of like pink andVictoria Secret stuff and most of thestuff still I swim in it I feel like soluckily these leggings I am still ableto wear these leggings which were alsoan extra small but these are the pinkones and they're the ones with the logoand I'm a little disappointed in the waythat they fit because online it showedthem really snug and form-fitted on themodel like almost like tights but when Iordered them and I ordered the extrasmall but when I put them on they'rekind of baggy they were only $20 so I'mgonna end up keeping them becausethey'll still be nice to wear on thehouse and you can fold it over like thisand then it has the logo but I just Idon't like that baggy look so I'm notgonna wear these out and then from theother stuff I had gotten some stuff fromNordstrom Rack - that's actually madelike absolute favorite place to buy likeactivewear Fitness stuff from becausetheir quality is really good and theprices are very very reasonable andthese this or Spri actually got for $15from their clearance and it's from theirown sell our brand which is really niceI know a lot of women actually comparedtheir gsella brand to Lululemon so it'sreally good quality and I love that ithas like the criss cross in the back andactually this is what I was thinking ofwith thewith this topic it would still match ifI wore this under it and then alsobecause of the pretty back it would lookgood under this top with the cutout backso I'm excited about wearing all thisstuff one thing I did want to mention mynext president purchase from Lululemonwill probably be their high time pant Itried on their I wonder under I knoweverybody loves those and also there arehigh times and for me personally thehigh time pants looked really reallygreat on me I think main reason is thatthey come in a 7/8 length and it fitslike a full-length legging on me andwhen I tried on the wonder under cropsand the full length they were kind oflike in between like the wonder underwas too long so I would have to get themget them like taken in a little bit of 9alula meadows that for free but it'sjust a hassle and then the crops weretoo high up so I couldn't reallyenvision like how it would look on meonce I got them fixed but the high timepant was perfect so that would probablybe my next purchase and I would havepurchased them in store when I went inif I didn't have these on and these aremy absolute absolute favorite lightingthat I own they are they're called thereflex 9 well they call 90 degree byreflex and I actually got these from TJMaxx but I found them in on Amazon andI'm going to order them in every singlecolor that they come in because they areabsolutely fantastic and so when I wastaking these on and trying on theLululemon pants their leggings justcould not compare to these these justsuck you in and they're just soflattering the behind like everywhere Imean if if you guys are only gonna getlike one pair of leggings I would saydefinitely try these out they're only 20dollars and they give any like high-endbrand that I've tried a run for theirmoney to definitely try these on I foundthese at my TJ Maxx but I never wentback to try to look for them because Ifound them on Amazon and with prime likeyou get it delivered right to you so I'mgoing to go ahead I'll ready have themin my cart like order them anddifferent colors that they have this isan extra-small and it fits me perfectlyif you guys are unsure about the side ifyou want to order I'll post the linkbelow but if you want to order if youscroll down I think there's like 2,500positive reviews on there and a lot ofwomen have posted pictures and listedtheir measurements and like their heightand all that and their weight so if youwanted to kind of figure out where youwould be you could read the comments andfigure it out I'm 5 3 M about 105 poundsright now underne and the extra smallfits me perfectly so I would reallyreally hug highly recommend these like Isaid there will mimic $20 and they everytime I wear these leggings people arealways asking me if I've lost moreweight what am i doing and literallyit's these leggings they just make youlook and feel like a million dollarsand actually I've worn these out withnice like tops and with like high heelsand they look just like pants but then Ialso work on it out in these so they'rejust really really great I really highlyrecommend them I'll post a link below ifyou guys want to take a look and like Isaid there's 2,500 positive reviews soyou know that's good so that's it for mylittle mini haul if you haven't alreadyplease check out my local Houston mommygroup that I did the video aboutyesterday I'll post a link in thedescription box box if you guys areinterested if you're not on the northwest side but you are still in Houstonand if you would like to join please doso because eventually as I get to knowall the members I'm going to start doingthings in different areas of Houston fornow the things I have scheduled aremostly in the north west side but like Isaid if I get enough people fromdifferent parts of Houston I don't mindscheduling stuff and scattering in Iranso that's it guys I'll catch you guyslater",22,UCoJsUlQugQdI99a1Kg-CGlw,The Universe Guru,6,20,0,42,"['mina irfan', 'indian', 'pakistani', 'youtuber', 'desi youtuber', 'lululemon', 'haul', 'fitness haul', 'lululemon haul', ""victoria's secret semi haul"", '2016', ""victoria's secret""]",Haul: Lululemon &amp; Victoria Secret (+My fav leggings ever!),RfZlqifpSyk,10986

Lululemon um there's a lot ofstuff that I like so and I have quite abit mainly what I like from there arethe pants I do like there's four throwswell I'm only trying one on but I dolike ityou know like their tops I don't like toreally purchase tops not much cuzthey're pretty pricey for a top um I dohave a few so I'll show you guys what Ilike and you may notice the backgroundsa little bit different I decided tostand up to make this video because Ifeel like I'm always sitting and it'skind of boring when I'm sitting but yeahalso for reference and pretty mucheverything I'm in like tops and stuff Iwear too for sports bras I wear likefour six and four pants over to sorefours I prefer twos but I can do eitheroneso yeah and if I forget any of the namesof these items I will probably put it inhere in the video or put it down belowoh yeah okay I'm gonna get started I'mgonna start with I only have one sportsbra and Ellie bought it for like aftermy breast augmentation so um I got thisin a six and I saw the tag on it butthis is a free to be bra it's one outlike the light support sports brasbattle like to be energy bra so I'llprobably get that next and in these oneslike the light sport I wear six but thenin thelike meeting support I wear for so it'swhat it looks like this has the strapsin the backhow's it all I think although sportsbras have padding in them but you canremove them in this one I'm just gonnatell you the price cuz it's on here butit's 42 so that is only sports bra thatI have from lemon I'll definitely bebuying more and then I only have oneother jackets and that's the definedjacket and again I have this in a size 2so I've got green one I don't know ifit's like olive but they have differentnames for them yeah she's like an olivecolor and this was really fitted so yeahand then has it thumbs and it's reallycool because I wouldn't cold you canflip this and it covers your hands sothe thought was really cool and yeah soI really like this one the one doesn'twanna I like is I think it's a dailypractice jacket that I've tried on instore but yeah that was reallycomfortable and I really liked that onetooand then I have two of the I don't knowif I'm gonna pronounce this right Ithink it's a swiftly tech shirt I thinkbut I have two of them I have it thisone oh my gosh she's so right it's likemaking my camera go crazy yeah it's justlike a coral color and it's really likeit's really fitted and again I wear size2 in these and they have a thumb holedown here too yeah I love these shirts Idon't think I can run right now cuz it'sa little bit warmer now but definitelylike in the winter these are the way togoand then another one I have is like thisburgundy color oh I love this one Ithink this is my favorite money so yeahI think the other like sixty choosesomewhere between like 60 to 68 but thepre pricey so yeah I love these shirtsand then for tank tops I have the nextones I'll show you are that like I thinkthat the power y ones so they're justlike I just have the Y in the back likethis and then they have like a built-insports bra in there and this one hascups put the black on that I have I youknow how many cups water but you knowthis one has like the padded cups andyet you and I think I think this one'shemmed but they're pretty pretty long myblack want to have to him for surebecause it so this is what the blacklooks like and this one I have to tiebecause like I said I don't think thisone's him so it's like super super longso yeah um and then next one's I'm gonnashow you there's a cool racer backwardsthese are really like form-fitting sopretty tight but again I also like totie these because they're super oh yeahthis is the white oneand I think these are like my favoriteones to wear to the gym um I have twofavorites that I like toward the gym thecool racerbackand I think it's the yogi when you sirback it's new I think I don't know Ijust recently discovered them but theseare my favorite the yogi ones are alittle bit like more like a baggy fitbut they fit like perfectly man this ismy buck cool looser back one and again Iusually tie this one on the side becausethey're super long but yeah and thenthis one is the yogi racer back I threeof these but it's thank you I thinkthese are like 52 or 48 I think they're48 because I think that cool racerbackones are 42 but I know it's kind ofpricey for just like a regular likeliterally regular tank top but the waythey fit is just like amazing likethey're not super low done yeah butthey're just slow enough like this ispretty high but like these come downlike right we're like a bra would cometoo and you don't have to keep likepulling it up like I know my Nike ones Ihave to pull him up constantly and it'sso annoying but yeah and that's a littlebit longer in the back too but I tie itin the back because again these aresuper long on me and here's black one itjust has the sit bone up back and it thesymbol well like on the gray one it'sgreat and on the black one it's black soit's just the same color it was a shirtand I get in like you can tell I tiedmine in the back they're super cutesuper comfortable and then the lastcolor I have is a little latest my godbut again you can tell symbol kind ofmatches a shirt yeah I love I don't Iforget what this color is called I thinkit's like space-dye I want to say mMmmmthere's like different like colorednames for other stuff I guess everycompany does so yepsuper cute I love those shirts andthat's all that I have for tops bottomsI have so many so I'm gonna go ahead andget started so I would say probably myfavorite pants from them are the wonderunder us they're kind of just like thebasic ones but they are best I feel likeso amazing so I have these ones theseare a size - I think yeah sighs - andthey're just great them like the mainrise not the high rise they're justgreat full length and I think these arethe space-dye ones too cyberspaceI think the like cyberspace day um nothey're not they're just basic I thinkbecause the cyber ones are the stripedones yep so yeah these are reallycomfortable and Lululemon has likedifferent fabrics which I still haven'tlearned they have like the full-on luanand like luxuryum and then they have like other onesbut I still have it really learned whichones they all are but I mean overall Ilike all of the pants pretty much soyeah yeah they're super long I don'tknow it doesn't bother meI just it's fine I roll them up a littlebit but yeah it's super comfortable Ilove these in thewhich ones are these I forget what theseare calledbut they didn't really look at the tabwhen I want them but and then these oneslike the running ones like if you go tothe website it would be under therunning pant because they have like theWanderers and yoga like category andthen it's like towards the very bottomunder running and but these are morelike got compression ones but I broughtI really like these and that has asymbol on the back there and it kind oflike curves so really it makes your buttlook really nice now zip zipper up thereand it has some pockets right easier andthen my favorite part about this is beback right here and I'm gonna try allthese on for you guys so you guys cansee what they all look like on but yeahthat's my favorite part that's like whatsold me on these so I love those andthen these lines are just my regularwonder under crops these are like one ofthe first pairs I got but I think theseruns are a size 4 and it exactly like uptoo so it's what I mean like in somethings I can wear fours or twos it justreally depends but these are the wonderunders higher rise the crops so yeahhe's got like above my belly button cuzI'm also really short so yeah and thenjust cropped just plain black simplesuper youand then I have these blue ones theseare the alignment that's it oh sorrythe other the align pant there's likethe naked few ones that everybody likeloves these these have been reallypopular and every time they get a newcolor in on the website they sell out sosince ice twos which is kind ofdepressing but it's okay and then I havethis other color in the line pant Ithink this is like a berry color it'skind of like like a purplish burgundyand then the band is a different colorand then it also has it on the insidehere I don't know why they made thesehave this on the inside because not alldoes it like all the other line pantsdon't have that so I think there mightbe enough like one other pair but yeahsuper comfy super stretchy and I like todo like legs in these because I reallymove with your body so love these andthen this is another pair of wonderunders this is the like heathered slateor something I think it's heatheredsweet mmm and these are also six two twothese are the been rice againlook link pant I prefer the full-lengthpant pant over the crop pant I don'tknow why I just don't like the crops asmuch okay and then this is another pairof I think this is like a specialedition one but it's a wonder anotherhigh-rise pant and this what it lookslike on the back and has a symbol rightthere in the pocket back here also ithas mesh going down the back of the legand so these you would be able to see alot better like on so Iit yeah these are so cute I love theseso originally I got my black and then Iloved him so I'm like oh my gosh I haveto get them in this car too because Ilove Burgundy and here are the blackones same thing they're just thehigh-res wonder undress yet these come alittle bit higher than the will regularhighways I've notice that so same thingjust in black I wear these long yeahalmost every like pair of Lululemonpants that have match on on I try to geta hold of them because those are myfavorite ones and those are always onesthat sell out faster and they're alsolike really hard to find after they sellout and then these are the all the rightplaces crop they look like again they'rea high-rise band and then these alsolike the lining back here it makes yourbutt look really nice so I really likethese and then I was like a V shape inthe front so like that and then it haspockets which it's like the best thingever because I can always just put myphone in there and yeah I mean you lovethese also I you can tell I have a lotof black and burgundy and gray those aremy favorite ones and then these ones Idon't if would say these aren't myfavorite ones because I don't knowthey're just really uncomfortablesometimes and they're pretty itchy butthey're the High Times meta mesh pantand they just come up pretty high it hasa symbol back here they're pretty bigtoo like the band's really thick andthen it has like the mesh here in thefront and this is what I don't likeabout it how this is but they'relike really cute on so you guys will seethat when I triedso yeah these are those and then this isanother pair of the lion pant that Ihave I just got I think this was thefirst paper villain thing I got was justplain black but I fell in love so I hada good so just plain black again reallystretchy these do peel a lot like reallybad like pretty bad I don't I've neverhad any problems with any of my otherpants peeling and I just throw them inlike the wash in and dryerAcharya says is a driver that does thatbut I just read them in there and Ihaven't had any problems with that so Iknow I should publish we're takingbetter care of them though becausethey're pretty expensive but my lionslike they get pretty pretty bad righthere and it's not even like the insideit's this part like the outside partwhich is weird because most of the pantswill get it like in the crotch area butthese don't you just kind of get it allover and that's really annoying so I trynot to wear those as much yeahand then these are the seek the heatcrop I wore these online and black andthis burgundy colorthe band's a little bit different itjust has like the lines on if you can itcan so it was like lions right there andagain these have like the pockets thepockets are mesh you can see throughthem and then this is my favorite partit's like the ruching here because ifit's a lot better on shorter people forme than just any other the crops becausethe other crops I still have to followthe bees fit like perfectly and then ithas the mesh coming down the side of theleg to the back but I do really likethese a lot of people say these run baitand when I wear my black ones I coulddefinitely tell like how to keep playingthem up but I can't get anything smallerthan I do so those sold out very quicktoo soand here's the black ones and warningsI've washed these so yep that's whatthey exact same thing I also try theseon for you guys so there's those thesenext ones are the make a move tight andthese also sold out really fast which Ididn't expect these two but they didanother Lululemon symbol and it has amesh all the way down the side of theleg and then the fabric like will meetright here and then there's more meshgoing down you can't see the bottom parton me because I'm so short but there'smesh there so when I try this on youprobably won't even see that but yeahagain I didn't like these as muchbecause they were super tight I shouldhave gone afford these but I got it toobut they are so tight so don't worrythose as much but I do like if I'm notworking out I can't wear those out andthen I have a pair of the the short thepattern I like these are cold but youcan always like fold them down cuz theyhave like the little symbol on the backand I mean on the inside and on theoutside of it and they're really reallyshort I would say they're shorter thenike compression pants and i think theyare when I looked up the inseam but dovery short McKinley doesn't thinkthey're that short but I'm like prettyshort so probably wear these like in thesummer time not any other time and thenI have just a pair of plain black underunder a high-rise pants so again reallythick band and I think these ones arethe full-on blue on the fall and then onthere like a little bit thicker I thinka little bit thicker and they're notlike a stretchy as the other ones Idon't know what the other ones arecalled like the fabric but yeah sofalling again these are also very longon meand then I have three more pairs one ofthem that I'm wearing so I'll show youguys those but these are the wonderunder crops these they don't really sellthis gray color anymore it's reallylight again these are up to size to midrise band and I'm just the crop ones Ireally like these actually these areprobably like my favorite pair ofcropped pants and then these ones arealso pretty hard to find these are theCypress type onesI'm not exactly sure on the color butagain a size too high times pants sothere's a 7/8 link yeah yeah I reallylike these if I wore them once but I dolike these and then the next pair I amactually wearing but you guys will allto see link in the Tryon I guess they'rejust another pair of wonder undersmid-rise and they're just striped umyeah nothing crazy but these are uhthese are like the look stream ones youcan kind of feel like the stripes onthem it's a very odd I do like these alotyeah that's it for my collection home Ihaven't had any problems with thempeeling at all and I just don't know inthe washer and in the dryer I don't likehang them to dry or anything so Iprobably should stop drying them thoughjust to be sure because they're prettypricey and a lot of these ones that Ihave like you can't get anymorebecause I know that Lou Diamond has likea I would say like a 5 year likewarranty or something like that but it'syou know the replacement or they'll tryto fix them but a lot of the ones I haveI really like and I probably won't beable to get them I thought ever doeshappen that's yeah I should always starttaking carea little bit better um but that is itfor my whole collection I'm not tryingto brag or anything I just really liketo watch these videos so I figured othergirls would really like to watch them aswell and if you have any questions

hey everyone so today I'm going to bedoing a comparison video and this isjust going to be me comparing twodifferent kinds of yoga pants andthey're both Canadian brands so I'm nota hundred percent sure if you guys haveheard of it but the first kind islululemon yoga pants versus TNA yogapants yoga pants I don't know where Yokocame from but um yeah I'm just gonna becomparing them and talking about thembecause I feel like this is like aCanadian girl that like wears these likethat's interested in these kind ofbrands kind of like a question that mostof them have is to you like TNA pantsbetter or Lululemon pants better so Idecided that I'll just do a comparisonvideo because I wish I would just likewatch some of these before i bought bothof them and so i'm just gonna talk aboutyou tip them separately and then you'llkind of see like the comparison betweenboth of them and so the first ones i'mgoing to talk about is the TNA pants andso this is what they look like they havea lot of lint on them so sorry aboutthat like you can see i don't know whybut I just needed to use a lint rollerbut whatever so this is what they looklike they have a white stripe right hereand the symbol symbol is on the back andit's just these like I don't even knowwhat it's called like whatever shapethat is I guess and so they're long andlike they flare out at the bottom so youcan see how big they are there theirextensive both these prayers pants areexpensive which is only what which iswhy I only have one pair of each thesewere for $85 so that's very expensive iknow but these are so so comfortablelike both these bears are reallycomfortable first of all um they thatmine has a white strip but you can getthem in a like many different stripeslike color wise like you can get likegreens Purple's Pink's Silver's goldsblacks things like that so you can getlike different kinds they're like reallythe reason I guess ever advisement isbecause they're so comfortable like Ilove wearing them I just feel I don'tknow like what's another word forcomfortable I guess and so these don'thave any pockets which kind of sucks umlike TNA has has like sweatpants and allthat like for both of them do you thinkto sweat pants and sweaters and all thatthen these are the lululemon pants sothey look slightly different so thatand they kind of have this band toothese are actually reversible which ithink is really cool i'll show you likethe waistband on the int like the otherway which I'll just flip them out rightnow which is like this red and pink andthen the symbol is right here if youwere to wear it inside out but if youwere to wear it this way which is theway I wear more because it's just blackso they can like match with everythingon the leg which I'm trying to findthere is the symbol right so yeah if youweren't this way you can see it likeit's on the middle of your calves soit's a little bit random but whateverthis one actually is a pocket which Iguess they think it's like made for likegym memberships since these are actuallyyoga pants and it also says like Ibelong to and then mobile so you canlike write your name and your phonenumber which actually haven't done butwhatever I guess we'll get around to aone day or another and so these are moreexpensive than the TNA pants they'reboth super comfortable these areninety-eight dollars plus tax and soyeah um personally I like the TNA pantswet are you in like they're cheaperwhich is awesome um I'm not sure why Iguess they're just more comfortable likethey fit me better I guess it depends onlike the way like your body shaped inwhatever for me at TNA pants like fitbetter but they're honestly bothcomfortable I wear them like almost likethe same amount like we're both of themthe same i guess i'm out i don't knowhow to put that but you can get thelululemon ones like in different colorslike their bands you can get differentcolors and like the tops like right herethey change all them and TL lululemonhas is like more yoga so you can getlike the capris in the shorts while TNAis not as much like that so I guessthat's my comparison if you guys haveany other questions about the differencebetween the pants you can ask down belowand I hope you guys enjoyed this videoand yeah I'll just you guys in the nextone so yeah bye,26,UCOeh7xIetGgJ62Ti6nBTIzg,Neha Nathani,0,83,0,147,"['LuLuLemon', 'Yoga', 'Pants', 'Vs', 'TNA', 'Artiza', 'fashion', 'comfy', 'stretchy', 'cute', 'everyday', 'outift', 'review']",LuLuLemon Yoga Pants Vs.

hi everyone so today I'm gonna do alittle haul for you guys it's acombination of a lot of things so I didgo shopping a little bit earlier lastweek so I wanted to show you guys thethings that I bought and I also went tomy peel box to pick up a few thingsso I wanted to do a peel box haul and Ihave two little food discoveries that Ihave for my parents so I wanted to sharewith you guys those things too so let'sget started on this I guess everythinghaul so the first place that I went tois a Lululemon and Lululemon is one ofmy favorite favorite favorite workoutclothes stores or brands I guess it's astore and a brand so I went to so thisis the Lululemon bag they give you aneco-friendly bag so the first thing I'mgoing to show you guys that I got isthis pink tank top with a built-inLululemon sports bra it's like soamazing I love it so much I wore this inmy how to get abs video it already has abuilt in bra so it's like really amazingand it has like the tank top ones thatlike kind of like the wind goes throughso you don't like sweat as much and it'snot super tight it's like loose flowyit's so amazing everytime Lululemon getshot pink and I just have to get it it'sso amazing I just I love it so much sothis is what I got I think it was like$68 it's a little bit more expensive butthey do last a while so this is what Igot my first purchase the second thingthat I got I wanted this for so longeverybody at the gym has it it is thewonder under crop and it's just likebasically like the cropped pants that golike this and it's just basic black witha little lemon logo in the back it'sreally really really amazing I love thisit was $72 they don't fade and the thingI like about Lululemon is they alwaysstay tight so it doesn't like reallystretch out a lot some of the leggingsthat I have had for the past years theystretch out a lot and they get likeloose and the thing is when you do thechild's pose you know how like leggingsI don't know if you ever like look toanybody while they're working out but itgets see-through on the butt and ifthere's like a guy next to you orsomething like you don't want them tosee your butt or like your thong youknow what I mean it's like so weirdLululemon ones are thick and they do notgive you the see-through but when youwear them so that's what I love aboutLululemon I have the shorts and there'sstill so good still they like haven'tfaded they look super new still and Ihad them for like a year so I loveLululemon clothes it's like amazing andagain they do not sponsor me I wish theydid that would be so amazing but theydon'tand the next thing oh wait this is likean old sports braI had this because I'm wearing theleggings and or the yeah the crop pantand the sports bra in my kim kardashianshoot so I just put them all together sothis is like an old bra but it's stillgood right like I've had it for a longtime and it's still legit so this is notsomething that I purchased recently Idid purchase this like a few months agothe next thing that I purchased is thisbra it's so cute it's called a takatamer - and it was 58 dollars it's kindof expensive but it's like a reallyreally durable unsecure fully supportedsports bra it almost looks like a brabecause it does have the clasps in theback I think it's super duper cute it'sso amazing I just love it I just lovethis pink line every time I get I seepink at Lululemon I just go crazy so Igot this it yeah I was 58 and it comesin your cup size so if you do haveboobies then this might be a good choicebecause it will be a super supportiveand it won't be like I guess like fancyyou know

hey Internet so I received this in themail remarkably quickly I just orderedit yesterday and it is with me in myhands right nowand that's a good thing but the naughtyside of me was also hoping that it wouldtake a longer to get here and the reasonfor that is that this is a large packageof Lululemon workout clothes meant toencourage me to get back into my workoutroutine I have not worked out at all forthe last couple of months which feelsreally embarrassing to say onlinebecause I feel like everybody makes itsound like they always work out likeevery single day and they are perfecthuman beings in the best of shape andI've been that before I've definitelybeen a really consistent with going tothe gym before over the last year but Igo through a workout phases where I'llgo every other day three to four times aweek which i think is a healthy amountunless you're training for something andthen I'll just stop I'll just get tiredof it and I won't want to go at allwhich doesn't mean that I do nothingphysical because I walk absolutelyeverywhere I don't drive so I still getquite a bit of exercise from that butyou know it's good to break a sweat andall that good stuff I'm not gonnalecture you guys because I wouldn't wantto be getting a lecture with my YouTubevideo recording this video is to showyou the good stuff that I got toencourage me to jump back in so let'srip this little guy open I really likethe packagingit's kind of cool has all their managerson it I don't think this is actuallypart of their mission statements becausethey actually kind of change over theyears but some first thing is one ofthese guys if you go shopping this oneperson and you ask really nicely they'llactually even give you several of theseand I'm a big fan of these because I usethem to bring food to work or anywherewhere I'm bringing food or transportingfoods in Tupperware which have atendency to leak sometimesfirst thing in here is the urbanite pantI'm actually pretty excited to sharethis with you guys and we're going todiscover it together because it's atotally new type of items that Lululemonhasn't really done before and these arepants that work in the gym but look likepants parade outside I don't know and itsays move over skinny jeans we designthese durable trousers to take over ourdaily commute and bring us to and fromthe gym so these are supposed to bewearable in daily life and in gym lifewhich is good in case I lose my resolvejust kiddingso because lilamon clothing is not cheapso I wear it to the gym at the gym andalso in my daily life when it's cleanobviously at the weekend so you can seetoday I'm just wearing this Lululemonpullover with a little signature cuffsas well but back to the pants these arejust really nicely tailored from what Ican see and they're made out of a reallynice thick stretchy fabric but it's alittle bit stiffer than your usual youknow astro pant or group at blue linesso I'll be interested in seeing whetherthese are actually comfy enough to wearlike let's say to yoga or for workoutI'm excited by the fact that they'rejust kind of branching out tryingdifferent things because I definitelyremember a time when they had hoodiesthey had groove pants and some runningtops and that was it like that's allthat they did and now every year theybranch out and they try more differentthings that are kind of convertible so Ireally enjoy kind of watching it as acompany and seeing what they come upwith and these pants are a pretty goodexample of that I didn't think that Igot is a little headband in this reallypretty kind of plummy color very verylike fall inspired it's got a littlemicro stripe too and basically I've gonethrough probably 15 of these throughoutmy Lululemon lifetime which is a longtime like I told you guys on about eightyears because you guys have heard of thebobby pin fairy and the sock monsterright there these creatures that live inyour home and they take your bobby pinsand take your socks and you can neverfind them again and even if you're notthe kind of person who loses stuff theystill go missing then you have to buymore if you need those things which mostof us do there's also a headbandcreature that lives in my home or in mygym locker I'm not really sure whichplace is haunted but it's there becauseI'm always losing my headbands theysometimes turn out sometimes not andright now I can't even find a single oneof them so I thought that I would getanother one next thing in the bag isbasically meant to be matched and evenexcusal of packaging and this is alittle workout top that you would wear asports bra underneath because it doesn'thave the built in support of some ofLululemon's bras and this is just areally nice supersoft plummy coloredt-shirt and I was super excited to seethat they had v-necks again because theyhaven't had v-neck spur a really reallylong time so you can see from the hugetag that rips off that this is a sizethanks I don't like my tops to be supertight in the gym I just like the feelingof fabric skimming over my body ratherthan hugging it that's probably becauseI'm not really a runner so I wouldprobably get a size downI was gonna run it in and want to get agood velocity you know that I probablyreally might stop that speak if you arereal runner I have no idea how to talkaround speak but anyway so this is thecar mati SS a lightweight tee designedto layer easily over your favorite tanksilky soft preshrunk so laundry day is abreeze that's excellent I hate it whenthings shrink so I think this color isvery pretty and seasonal another pair ofpants because my pants are always in thewash from the lemon and it makes such agood excuse to not go work out because Ijust wear them all the time they're socomfy and flattering and I haven't hadany transparency issues if you'rewondering it the transparent pantcontroversy definitely did affect theirstocks but it did not affect my decencyat least not that I know of so I gotanother pair these are called the citypulse pant and it says these skinny legpants make it easy to transition betweenthe yoga studio and the street and it'smade with their signature four-waystretch luan as you would expect and Ithought this was super cute and this iswhat pushed me to get it and hopefullyyou can see that it's got ruching goingall the way down the leg probably fromabout where your knee hits and then it'sgot the usualreally nice fluttering seaming at theback and the wide waistband around yourhips that just makes them such greatparents along with the little key pocketin case we use that at the gym so Ireally like that these are a straightleg and I prefer the astro pass over thegrowth pants because they have a bitmore of an arrow or leg but even theyare still pretty wide cut so this iskind of fun because they're not wonderunder is which are like leggingsbasically they're a little bit widerthan that in more like pants butdefinitely a slimmer cut than youraverage Lululemon workout pants awesomemy god is another t-shirt in a slightlydifferent cut this has a kind of wideyou should see if I can show youa wide boatneck which is really niceit's basically you are average whiteteeth made out of that signatureLululemon cotton that is nice and thickand comfortable and just really kind ofbody skimming I think you guys can kindof see the way it's not cut totallystraight so they tend to be really niceand flattering and the name of this oneis the D Jana it's D hy a and a is thesuper soft natural fiber T is about tobecome the wardrobe staple you can'tlive without that's a big promise tomake but the color is definitelyconsistent with that because it's just areally nice classic it has a little bitof gray Heather in it which I like itgives it a bit more texture and I thinkit will be a really nice table to add tomy wardrobe because we can never havetoo many white tees trying to take careof your Lululemon clothing because likeI said it's pricey and it does need careusually I will just run a little lemonwash about once a week altogetherbecause you're not really supposed towash it with other things like genes orCotton's you're definitely not supposedto put it in the dryer you should alwaysdry it flat so in case you guys havenever been told that by an educator atthe store you can trust me on thatbecause I've made the mistake before andyou can totally tell the difference inyour clothing after you mistreated itthat way so keep your Lululemon clothingcoddled and safe and loved and I hopeyou guys have had a really great weekand I will see you in my next video byelittle additional bonus footage Ithought I would show you guys a close-upof my nails because I'm just so in lovewith the way these look I bought thisnail polish about a year ago but Ididn't know where it all that muchthis is Orly space cadet and it is justthe most beautiful duochrome really fineglitter so it will be a total pain totake off but I think it's worth itbecause you can see how it flushes fromgreen to gold and then there's quite abit of like a purpley redgoing on there as well so I think thatis so gorgeous and then the other thingthat I wanted to show you is a cake thatI made for my friend's birthday isn't itgreatRob it's not a traditional birthday cakebut this person kind of like me does nothave much of a sweet tooth so this is acranberry cocoa cake and it was amazingI mean it still is amazing I may havehad a slice for breakfast but you cansee how packed with cranberries it is soit's just so festive I don't really knowif you guys are interested in baking itall but I am going to put the recipe inthe information box just in case you arefeeling like you need a really good fallcranberry dessert recipe you might wantto add a little more sugar to it ifthat's your inclination but other thanthat it is just the most perfect cake soI like to share it with you along withmy beautiful fingernails and thank youfor watching it I will see you guys nexttime

why you have a videoFriday really sorry and then monday wasa QA so if you haven't seen that yet youshould definitely go wash it so much funanswer all your guys questions and todayis yet another haul so let's get into itfirst place that I went was urbanoutfitters and actually only got onething and it's like this trench coatsort of jacket um I almost got this ingreen but I already have two of thegreen ones so probably shan't getanother one but that is like true littlelike flaps so it's a bit looser and itgives it kind of more of like a softergirly field and then on the back it hasthis like little like I don't know whatyou call that flap good at describingthings then I went to lululemon and Ihaven't been there in forever so I gotjust a few basic things first thingbeing this tank top it's really coolbecause it can it's like a tank topcombined with the sports for us but youdon't have to worry about like your topfalling down which is always annoyingand as it's really cool like low backand the actual sports hall itself islike striped and it has really kool KrisKross i think it is called the free tobe wild tank it will be linked downbelow as well aseverything else in this hall so if youwant to know where I got something or ifyou want to buy it for yourself you canclick the link down there then i gotthese gray leggings and I'm usually likejust for black leggings kind of gal butI decided to branch out and get theseand they're like really really reallysoft and they look tiny but they'reactually a size 4 so yeah they're reallyreally stretchy and I think these arejust like they're classics I don't knowwhat they call their luggage but they'rejust basic legging except they're thisreally cool heather gray next thing it'sactually from a local boutique but thebrand is ezel so if i could find it iwill link it this gray so like flowyPecos off and then the bottom rightthere has this really cool like linenstriping and hopefully I can get awaywith throwing this at school but it's sosoft and really cute and it smellsreally good I guess it's like the candlethey were burning in the store but Ireally like this and it's just a reallynice basic with a little added detail afew things from target the first onebeing this sort of like turtle necksweatshirt thing and at school umapparently if you wear a turtleneck youdon't have to wear it callers like apolo collar so that's really nice I worethis to school yesterday and it's sortof this I ditch it's like cream and thenunder the stitching underneath is blackso it gives off like a light greyappearance if that makes any sense andit's this really floppy sort of likecowl-neck turtleneck I really like theLuther turtle X or the shorter ones thenI got this cardigan and I really noticedlike this fall that I've been lovinglike maroon and burnt orange I've hatkind has like this big for like floppycollar sort of thing I really have beenloving like drapey cardigan and it's abit chunky and it'll be really nice towear to school because it is a solidcolor I also got a few things from madewell and I try to kind of stay away fromthere because their stuff is a bit morepricey but like I realized that thequality like really is worth the pricelike their quality is so good I got fourthings from there so the first thing isthis like button up and it's white withthis sort of like charcoal II black pinstriping and I think this will look likereally cute like unbuttoned over maybe ablack or gray shirt with some rose golddrewlurie and I really do like this it'skind of like a more boyish kind of likecasual feel it's next thing oh I thoughtbut it's this cardigan and it's likethis really sort of like stretchy knitI've seen these all over tumblr and ithas these kind of like drapey saggypockets that are actually like built into the cardigan they're not like sewn onlike a lot of other ones and this isactually a medium because they did havea small or extra small I probably wouldhave gotten a small but the medium isfine because it's like a bit oversizedand it's like so stretchy and cool andit's so so so soft so I am a huge fan ofthis the next thing that I got was thissort of like charcoal gray it looksblack on camera but it's more of a darkgray playing sweater and it has thisreally nice like set my hair on fireback there and it has this really coolat crisscross detail on the bottom thenokay so I have the light gray version ofthis but I love it so much that I had toget a different color this is heard oflike a sage green and it has reallyinteresting like almost like flat knitlike it's not very like chunky or likefluffy like a lot of other shutters thatI kinesin I really love how the ham iscurved and a bit longer on the back andthen just straight across on the frontso I can also wear this to schoolwhenever i buy a more expensive things Itry to make sure that they fit my dresscode alright so then I went to H&M andyou guys know that I love forever 21 butI just kind of like exhaust like myselflike i'm a bit sick of it for now so irealized that i have that like shoppedat H&M since like summer i think thelast time that I shop at H&M was inLondon so I June so I haven't boughtstuff in there and like such a long timeso I decided to check out their websiteand see what they had and they actuallyhad some really cute things so the firstthing that I got with this great sort ofCardigan zippered jacket you guys as youcan tell from this hall I really lovelike neutrals and grey and it has thishuge sort of collar and then it's sortof a double-breasted throw it zips likethatI think it is so cozy and so warm andit's also really like chic I can seemyself wearing this with like someheeled booties or something I got this treally flowy and kind of like flutterydown at the bottom and it has thisreally pretty black and white art decoprint I'm not like a huge like patternsfan but this one is a bit more likesubdued it's not like a huge pattern Ithink this is just like a really nicetalk just story on like a casual daywhen I feel like wearing a t-shirt but Iwant to look a bit more dressy nextthing okay so i thought this when I gotit was like more of like a jacket /cardigan but I mean I said it's anactual like full-on blazer so I dorealize that and I can't return it so Iguess if I had like somewhere fancy togo and I can wear it but it is so sortof cream blazer and I joked aboutwearing this when i went to see speckerbecause like James Bond worth like awhite tuxedo jacket in it but I thinkthat'd be a bit weird so it looks likethis and I didn't know I might find someway to style it kind of like a likebusiness chic sort of look I don't knowif I do find a cute way to wear it Iwill probably post the picture on myInstagram so if you don't follow me oninstagram it is very

reallyreally love this I can't wait to justlike stop it's like a plain grey maxidress would really go with like anythingthat you put it with so the last thingthat i got from H&M and also the lastclothing thing that I got is this pairof joggers and they're from hmm andas I said earlier I really have beenloving maroon so they have this sort ofkind of like ECOT / as tech polkadotPaisley's on them you see that pattern Idon't even know how to describe it it'sauto focus anyways when I really likeabout these is that they don't cinch atthe end don't connect poof up at thebottoms but they have billionairespockets and they're so comfy like theseare just as comfy as sweatpants and Ican wear them to school on Fridaysbecause they are not technicallysweatpants Oh the last two things that Igot

may have put too much onand then I've got some avocado here forsome fats to have on the side so I'mgonna have that and then head out for myappointmentso I'm on my way to my eyelash anotherwayget eyelashes done but I got a reallygood deal on itcurrently I wouldn't suggest doing themjust because you get a deal on itbecause that might be a reflectionof the person and how good of a job theydothey have had them done before and I'mgetting them done with the really usedto do them and she was offering like adeal to come back kind of thing and do afull set of early fifty buckswe couldn't ask thatbut if the status was not good planningon my part Sunday and I am feelingsomewhat overwhelmedthe amount of things I have to getjust leaving for the Arnold on Wednesdaymorning and I work Monday and Tuesdayall down all day I'm so much to get donehourthat's kind of overwhelming me and Ialso just have a ton to get done at homebefore we go between laundry and it justfeels very unorganized right now and youknow also making sure I'm going to belike prepping clearly while I'm thereand this is going to be the first timenot the first time but my last twoperhaps I just counted macros and I amstill counting macros but I'm trying tofollow step though choices so I have tobe prepared with meals when I go I can'tjust be flying by the seat of my pantsdrinking shakes and things like that sothat overwhelmed my nails did while I'mout because they were starting a chipand it's easier to get them done onSunday versus trying to fit it in aftera work night I wanted to get them donebefore the Arnold I do them super supershort like very short so that they don'tget in my way coz I use a keyboard a lotand I kind of show you guys my eyelashesalthough I don't look very good I don'twant it to up close I did not end upputting makeup on today because I justdidn't care so there they are shouldkind of put some longer ones on theoutside so and it doesn't hurt oranything like that there is like aslight burning feeling not burning butlike a little likeyou just you can feelthat she's putting on something with theeyelashes like so it gets my eyes get alittle sensitive a sensitive to that butthey feel absolutely fine now she justsaid don't get them wet for a while solike till tomorrow don't get them wetdon't use like any eye cream or anythingso probably gonna see makeup free todayand it's gorgeous in Syracuse it's like58 degrees my car sucks right now so Ithink I'm just gonna go home now so Ican eat and then maybe go for like alittle run outside I don't think I'llget sweaty out there just to get alittle more cardio and and yeah so I'mgonna drive honks I've got thirty fiveminute ride home from where I am rightnow cuz there is nothing near where Ilive so off I go back home now so I justmade some lunch I am having just some 95hamburger meat ground up and I overcooked with four ounces of these littlewhite potatoes that I cooked in somecoconut oil put some garlic on there andtomato basil mrs. dash and a cup ofbroccoli so I'm gonna stand here like Iusually do and check some client emailsand that's about it right now somebodyin the life video is rather boring todayI realize this now but you guys want tosee a day in the life this is it justdid coaching stuff did a few videosdoing more videos now just likeanswering random questions I get myemail cuz I got so many from people andI try to respond to all of them but thenI just figured maybe I just start doinglike some shorter videos like thatbecause most of my videos are extremelylong so just decided to start doing moreof those so you'll notice like there'llbe a few posts at a week probably of mejust answering questions so if you guysthink the topic is a good topic thenwatch it or if you just think like theinformation or content I put out thereis helpful to others love if you guyscan help me out by sharing it on yoursocial media accounts I really want tokeep growing my channel as best as I canwithout compromising Who I am to do soand one of the biggest feedback thingsof feedback I'd say I get from people isthat they like the contentin terms of the dietitian talks and theeducation that I put out there so Ithink there's probably more people thatcould benefit from it so if you guyswant mine please share those videos ormy dietician talks with other peoplethat would find it interesting as youcan see I'm looking kind of tired todaypineapple bun very tall today can barelyput it in the shot but yeah I justwanted to show you guys I got a fewthings I'm sorry at the mall this weekin preparation for the Arnold so Ithought I would just share with you acouple things I grabbed a couple ofexpensive things but we're gonna takeyou over to my table and first I want toshow you I got these the other day atVictoria's Secret's and I'm super dupersuper dupe obsessed and I know people dotheir favorites videos I don't really Ihaven't done that but I just wanted toshow you absolutely loving this rightnow turn this around here this scentmixed we're gonna secrets the we have apink store in our mall the hot crushdoesn't really look super pretty oncamera or anything special that I'm soobsessed with the fragrance I don'treally know how to describe what itsmells like but it's so good I'm notreally a fan of this style bottle thoughbecause it's kind of a to pack itin my gym bag or like traveling but Ireally love the body splash it's justkind of great to just spray on like Itry not to like smell too perfume andwhen I go to the gym at the same time Isweat like a mother so I like to putsomething smelly good on so those are myfavorite right now so check those out -425Tori secrets so I really wanted a pairof Nike Air Max knickers they just looksuper comfortable I love the wedge onthem I love aesthetically how they lookso I was thinking well that would belike a great shoe to wear the Arnold'sstanding on my feet all day and we wentto finish line and I tried them on andthey only had them in kids so I don'tknow if the kids version is likesomewhat different but it felt likelike you know I'll admit sometimesdo by issue because I like the way itlooks but I need comfort especially ifI'm gonna stand all day long and thosejust didn't feel good actually I didn'tlike the kids version as much like theyjust didn't look as cute to me so Idon't know if you guys anyone has NikeAir Max is what you think if you knowthis style I'm talking about it's gotlike the nice thick sweat on it soanyways I ended up going with adifferent pair of sneakers because I didneed a new pair of sneakers just to kindof stand on and train with two so I wentwith these guys these are the nice flatflat shoe but the nice thing about thembecause I have Nike Flyknit I love totrain in those are like too flat toactually wear and stand on your feet allday they don't feel good these are theseare the Nike Air Max vs Nike Air Max noyeah Nike Air Max via six and a halfI have BBP so those are the shoes I likethe way they look most of all I like theway they feel he had good support inthem I was actually pretty surprised myfirst looks at them I thought itwouldn't be super comfortable but Iliked itand then I picked up two just some lightlightweight performance socks kind ofthe ones that cut down so you can't seelike your big soft underneath so I gotthose at finish line and then I went toLou lemming say heard they were having asaleyou always have a sale rack but thenmake out so hot some of them are tanktops alike I know I'm not a figurecompetitor but my lats are just too bigfor some other tankand then I felt like a stuffed sausagein there cuz like my lats we're hangingover it wasn't a good luck so anyways Icould get a good deal on one of theirjackets it's called the cozy cozy cuddleup jacket no maybe not focus no focusthat baby I square for $59 they didn'thave it in a size two I usually liketheir sweatshirts on the sites to checkit out for you but size for if it's mejust fine it's just not as tight butthat's cool I don't need it to be supertight but I thought this was nice it'snot too heavy which is good becausewe're hopefully finally coming into orwhether you're in New York so you couldlike do it there or you could um go likethis for them go all the way upward it'slike kind of this cute little haveanother um hoodie buy them like that andit's got pockets so sometimes I like thetooks it fits me better in here theoverall I thought it was pretty prettycute and cozy so you know you can flipthat down or like that you know what I'msaying so but that was super cute forsixty dollars like you can like hoodiestypically cost $60 not that this ishoodie it's kind of a jacket but I likedit so creep back up in here and then Igot one more thing everyone I know Robingallant and is always talking about thealign pants and so I'm like I gotta trythese on so I always see people who alsofollow Robin writing that they boughtthe aligned pants and loved them somelike Jesus I had to try these on wellunfortunately my Lululemon the onlycolor they had in my size was blackwhich I kinda wanted like a fun colorand I never do fun colors so I did endup getting the black so I really likethe way they fit it's got like the nicehigher up band I know this doesn't showyou too much butso I like them they're very lightweightand I think what people say is you beyeah naked sensation it says on thereyou basically feel like you're notwearing any pants and doesn't want tolike feel like they're not wearing pantsright so especially at the Arnold it'sgonna be hot and they're so thinkingthese might be like so the align pantshighly recommend I did try going up assizing them to get like a fun blue colorbut they just they felt too too looseyou know so that's all I ended upgetting from Lululemon it was crazypacked in there crazy busy and wassweating in there and then the onlyother place that I was trying to findlike I don't even know where either ofthese but I went to forever 21 here'sthe problem forever 21 for ladies outthere maybe guys you shot their Tukesthey have a guy section there's just somuch stuff like there is so much to lookat so much to pick through and it's justalmost like I get anxiety being in thereit's like overload of because it'snot well organized either like I don'tquite understand the organization ofthat store probably better off likeshopping forever21 online where you cando it in the privacy of your own homeand not feel like you're going a touchcrazy but they do have a great workoutclothes section and I picked up thissports bra that I thought was super cuteso it's just like a little white sportsbra and it's got like black mesh inbetween you know to show off on thecleavage and then on the back it's kindof it got the same little thing and Ilike the straps on it it's kind of likea different material cute shot I don'tknow just that was really cute was 15bucks figured why not so I picked thatup and then the only other two things Ifound I didn't I wasn't really crazyabout they're like workout tops therewasn't anything that I reallyI had to have but I found these twolong-sleeve crops I really like the lookof long-sleeve crops I think they lookreally cute I like these because they'renot like too to crops like they showlike I just like a little bit of yourbelly like that much so I could wearthem with like a Lululemon pant wasbloated or not wouldn't be a big dealand they're very light and airy sothere's only five bucks for that andactually like fits kind of tight andlooks really nice so I got a gray oneand then I also got a black one so samedeal five bucks just like a long-sleevetuff I figured it'd either wear it atthe expo or maybe even just like workingout I'm not really sure what theweather's gonna be like yet in Ohio sothat was a cheap little purchase thatwas like twenty five dollars at forever21 so can't go around there those werethe items I've shopped this weekprobably wouldn't have shopped it allhadn't been for the Arnold coming up Ijust kind of wanted like a few newthings you go there and everyone looksamazing everyone's looking their bestyou just want to feel confident and goodso that's my little shopping haul foryou guys I

little things you can stick insideyour agenda but anyways she got me abunch of pens which are super adorableshe got me this set which comes in likea green teal and pink and they'resupposed to gel pens and then she alsogot methis black and white set which isawesome and this teal and gold set whichis really cute as well and she told meshe got these at target because I don'tknow if you guys have heard

thisawesome list pad it has a magnetic piecehere so you can stick it on your fridgeand just write lists at night right somany lists when I go grocery shopping orwhen I have to do things for the nextday I just write it down so I don'tforget I just find writing it down is somuch better than putting it in youriphone even though I do both of them butI find writing it down it's just quickerand it just is so much more satisfyingfor some reason she also got me thissticky pads sticky notes which i willprobably use to stick in my agenda butthis is really cute as well because ithas like a

of a celebration but you know myboyfriend's on tour so you gotta do whatyou gotta do the next things are thingsthat I have purchased in this month ofMarch and I honestly pretty much used mybirthday as an excuse to buy thesethings but also i need to revamp mycloset i actually got my best friends tocome over and I told them you know youguys have to sit down and tell me what Ineed and what I don't

I got a khaki pairthat's what I got from garage and thenext place i went to is aritzia if youguys have not heard of aritzia it's Ibelieve it's a Canadian store butaritzia is awesome it's definitely notcheap but it's such a great store forbasic pieces but very good qualitypieces as well so i only got i think twothings from here to start i got a tanktop very basic tank top it's it goespretty high

meis that you can actually wear this thisway or you can turn it around and wearit backwards because the slit can beyour stuff like it'll show your stomachand apparently it looks good the otherway as well I'm really excited to trythat out um so yeah I mean if you seethis dress in aritzia definitely try itout and it is also by wilfred and thenext thing i got is from zara Ireally like Zara and I

one soi just thought i would show this candlei got this is the baja cactus blossomwowza not only is it a really prettyblue color oh my goodness it smells sogood and i'm not usually like a big fanof like the bath and Bodyworks summerand spring candles I'm usually more oflike the winter and fall sense likemarshmallow toasted marshmallow vanillabean Noel leaves and all of that Iusually don't like like the fruitierones but this one smells really good itsays the alluring beauty of a cactusflower captured in a blend of freshwhite flowers green cactus stems insunkissed coconut now that to me

how is Lululemon changed since you cameon board I think I've been very true tochips original vision and values what Ithink I've been able to do is create aculture and a scalability and a climatefor everybody to really live it everydayyou know as I think that ability tocreate the strategy the programs theplans and communicate and build theteams that are capable of creating itevery day is is what I'm good at andchip had I think the insight and thevision to create this beautiful dreamwhat was it about his dream what didwhat is there a secret to what hecreatedI think shipmasters paradoxes so youknow he brought beauty to athletic wherehe brought you know the art of I thinkthe you know the individual into team ina beautiful way so you know he he's justreally good at creating paradoxes thatare somehow magical and intriguing and Ithink that's what attracted me the chiefexecutives broadcasting live on the SFUBT School of Business on CK NW,22,UCDFgYuR6bb7VJIhQ9YAfmTQ,CKNW980,0,0,0,1,"['christine day', 'lululemon', 'ceo', 'chip wilson', 'active wear', 'clothes', 'yoga', 'cknw', '980', 'chief executives', 'bill good', 'radio', 'Clothing (Industry)']","Christine Day, CEO, Lululemon - Changes at Lululemon",TBP4bVJ_8YU,682

"hi everyone this is lauren so I wentshopping yesterday i went to victoria'ssecret and i went to lululemon mainlybecause I needed to get more support formy friends all my bras were fitting veryvery ill fitting I haven't bought brasin a long time and I thought maybe myside has changed after I was pregnantand I gave birth and I breastfed for areally long time and then I stopped andI thought my boobs shrank or somethingthey went back to being like perky againwhich was like a plus kind of thingafter I breastfed because it was alittle worried about that but um Ithought that maybe they shrink orsomething because none of my bras werefitting properly and I hadn't boughtabroad a long time during myself usingmy method yesterday that I i did a videoon a long time ago which i'll put thelink down if you're interested it's moreof a joke video than anything else butit does show how I measure my boobs andI ended up actually being the same sizeas I was pre all of that stuff likeseveral years ago so it actually wasthat all in my bras had stretched outand just um they kind of just got funkyand I didn't even think about that Ijust thought that my boobs changed andmy body changed and whatnot but anyway IGod new bras and I want to share themwith you um really good ones I feel likereally good about the choices that Imade I asked on Facebook and I got a lotof feedback about bras that people likedand uh it wasn't until yesterday or thismorning that someone said I hate howVictoria's Secret bra stretch out that Ilike realized that it was my bras thatstretched out let's just show you what Igot a Victoria's Secret first I'm reallya big black where I like to wear black amajority of the time so I ended upgetting one black bra as seen here andthis one is the I tried them on I wasveryaight

have gotten thisone if they had it in my size in blackbut they didn't have it in my size sothis dark green is not a bad option i dolike uh I like green and I like thiscolor green happens to be one of myfavorite show there we go that is theshade of it's so pretty um it just andit's got this nice little bit ofdetailing but not anything that'llreally show through your clothes like alace would and I like that it has asnap-front closure I just am a huge fanof snap front closures I think they'reeasy to get off they're easy to put onand I feel like they look really sexyand buying bras made me feel like sexyagain I haven't felt like I used to feelreally sexy and it's not that I don'tfeel sexy anymore I kind of just got inmom mode and got a little bit lazy and Ifeel sexy in these bras so I'm reallyhappy that I ended up buying brasbecause I want that sex appeal back Ifeel good i'm starting to feel really Idon't know it's not that I didn't feelgood about myself I just wasn't reallythinking about myself um and now I'mlike I need to be sexy Victoria's Secretracerback that's all they call it theracerback I don't know but it's also gota little bit of padding um and it pushesup and it looks awesome and the last brathat I ended up getting was this onewhich is this kind of copper color veryvery pretty like a rust copper color umI love the color I don't normally liketo buy colored bras I really just liketo buybut they didn't have this one in my sizeeither and I thought that this detailingon the back was just so pretty I'm aperson that doesn't mind if their brashows I like when the bra shows a littlebit I think it's kind of sexy I know alot of people don't like it but younever do what other people like you dowhat you like so you do you gotta do youbut I think that's just so pretty and Ilove that like the company free peoplemakes all of the kind of bras that cango under things that you can kind of seethe lines and everything like that butthey don't have any kind of support andthey don't like push you up and make yousexy where this makes you sexy and evenif people don't see the underneath youdo and you just feel good about you Iit's all about you feeling good aboutyourself and um you can just know thatit's very sexy bra underneath then I gotsome underwear if you're interested inseeing the underwear that I gotVictoria's Secret always does like 3 430 or whatever may be 33 so I ended upgetting this green color that matchesthe green bra and I think it's reallypretty really really pretty and then Igot just two black because you know i'mall about the black and I didn't likethe copper underwear that they had butthey have like this pretty detailing Igot two of these this one because Ireally liked it so it's not that prettydetail very very sexy and then I endedup getting this low-rise hiphugger fromthem which which was free it's aten-dollar underwear but they I got acoupon in the mail so i got ten dollarsoff a bra or it was like your completepurchase i got ten dollars off mycomplete purchase and then this freepair of underwear and I did get a freetote bag from them but I gave it to oneof the roles that was behind me becauseI'm like do whatever you want a tote bagand they gladly accept him I don't knowif you'll know this about me but I usedto walk a lot um and I've gotten out ofit and i recently got this umwhat do they call this this is byjawbone the company is jawbone and thisone is the up24 I got this one and thisis a size small if you're interestedthey come in different sizes my wristsize is 5 inches and three quarters fiveand three-quarters of an inch and itseems to fit fairly well I was a bunchof fitness bracelets on the market thatyou can get that basically count yoursteps some a little do your heart ratethis one doesn't do the heart rate thisone basically just counts the steps andit also monitors your sleep you wear itone hundred percent of the time I guessyou have to charge it at some point butit on your phone it tells you how manysteps you've walked in a day and it alsotells you when you were the most activeand I don't know it just it kind of isgood motivation because I've gotten outwalking or I walked a lot I walkedeverywhere I just I really enjoy walkingand when I walk I always feel so muchbetter it just it gets it pumps up myenergy I always have so much more energywhen I walk some point during the day Ilike to start off my day walking butthat isn't always the case for me Ican't always do it because I have thingsthat I need to do or maybe the weatheris not right or whatever but I like towalk outside and I'm fortunate enough tolive in a place that stays very nice amajority of the time so I'm able to walkoutside a lot and I recently got thisand I realized how little that I walk ina day so this has been like a greatmotivation for me to step up my walkinggame I like it so far I just think thatit's really good motivation i look at myappt a couple times a day and like howmany steps did I take did I get to my mygoal of 10,000 steps in the day and if Idon't I feel a little disappointed if Ido I feel really good but since I'vestarted walking again lemon because Ineeded a new sports bras I have a lotsports bras but most of them have gottenfunny over time so it's just time tolike get rid of them donate themwhatever I got the sports bra that I'mwearing now and I got a new pair ofshorts these are really really cute thatis the back of them and this is thefront of them and they kind of it's likea galaxy print but kind of floral it'slike a combination of the two things andI think that they're completelywonderful and I like that they're higherrise so they'll like suckin like anybelly fat but they're short I like shortI just like shorts there the bookieshort rolled down so i guess you canroll them down but when i wear them ohoh that's cute okay so you can wear themup high like that and so it's got thelittle lululemon cement symbol but ifyou roll them down they have a littlelululemon symbol to their very very cuteso I'm happy that I got these and I'mexcited to wear them it's been a littlebit cold here so I haven't had theopportunity to

"hey guys welcome back to another videotoday I will be doing a haul video ofstuff that I have recently purchasedthis is kind of like a cumulative overthe past couple of weeks I definitelydidn't go and buy all this stuff in oneday but I haven't gotten a lot ofrequests to do a haul video and this isalso kind of stuff that I've really beenloving I've been purchasing some thingsand I don't know where all of them are Ithink my sister took stop so I will beshowing you the things that I do havewith me today and also an excitingpurchase because one of these things wasactually my first pair of designer shoesI'm gonna talk a little bit more aboutlike why I purchased these shoes when Iactually like to show you guys anunboxing kinda I'm getting over a coldso if you hear me like a little bit morenasally than normal because I'm gettingover a cold um I was actually planningon filming a lot last week but it justreally knocked me on my ass this cold soyeah you think I sound a little bitdifferent it's because I am getting overa coldso the first thing I'm gonna show youare these Javan she shoes a little Gmoshi unboxing I'm gonna show you theshoes first and then got kind of giveyou a little bit of a story so these areby G Vaughn she and I purchased these Ihe'll run through it was the day thathayley segar came and visited me so itwas like two or three weeks ago i've hadme sit in here and i just haven't hadtime to film I actually haven't uploadedthe vlog from that day I didn't reallyvlog them much but Haley did upload hervlog of what we might saw link that downbelow but it was from that day sowhatever she was here is a day when Igot them it's obvious on Instagram acouple weeks ago I believe it wasneutral zinc who was the first personwho I saw happy shoes and I just fell inlove I'll just show you the shoes sothese are the Omega the exact nameissues are the G washi logo slideleather sandals they have them in likefull rubber and they're a little bitcheaper but I just thought the leatherlook nicer and it looked a little bitbetter than just like the rubber sandalsso that's why I decided to get theleather logo slide sandals of course notlink them exactly down below theseretail in Canada for four hundred andeighty dollars which you know it's alittle expensive for sandals like thisbecause they are you know like there'sjust like the Nike flop idea and Iactually was planning on getting a pairof like the Nike flop sort of sandals Idon't know why I always thought theywere ugly but for some reason they kindof grew on melike this past winter that when I sawthe put like a photo of these onInstagram I was like okay I need to getthese because it's kind of like myBurberry rain boots like yes I could goand get you know like $20 rain bootsfrom Walmart or you guys look $40 slidesfrom Nike it's like the fact thatthey're like I don't know obviously likeI bought them because they were designerI'm not gonna be one of those people whoare like yes like I didn't buy thembecause though she thought she like thequality was there I know it's kind ofoutrageous like the price is kind ofoutrageous for these shoes but I'm thetype of person where if I know I'm gonnause something a lot I don't mindspending more if I like them moremy sister was joking me she's like yourfirst pair of designer shoes and they'renot even heels they're like littleflip-flops and yes I could go ahead andbuy a pair of like Louboutins or stufflike that but I'm not the type of personthat wears heels a lot and so I don'tfeel like spending over $1,000 on a pairof heels is necessarily worth my moneyright now I really love the Chanel flatbags and I'm looking into I'm lookinginto them I'm not gonna lie I'm lookinginto them but they just don't I justdon't feel like it fits my lifestyleright now because I'm very like casualso I'm not sure if like a Chanel flap Ireally fits my vibe even though I amlooking at them and my friend ArielChristiana she I just got this new likeChanel toe bag which is stunning but ifmy life did start to get more likedressy and more formal I'd be wearingmore heels and obviously I might want toget one pair of like classic pumps thatwe're designer just because you know Ilike designer stuff sometimes I like tosign are things I'm not gonna be like ohI didn't buy it because the name becauseobviously the name appeal to me so yes Igot these in a size 7 it fit me like aglove but they fit very perfectly therewasn't a huge difference between the 7and the 8 but I already have flat feetand the 8 just felt really wide and likemy feet we're gonna like fly out I wishI had half sizes like 7.5 would havebeen like perfect but the a just felttoo wide that's coming from someone whoalready has flat feet I just picturedmyself wearing them with like mythree-quarter length like croppedleggings and just like a black shirt andthen these and it just looked so likeeffortless and kind of I don't know justlike cool just look like this on thefront and then on this side on theoutside side it does say as you own sheParis and they have these in a couple ofcolors I saw that they havewait to have them in blue but you know Ijust figured black would be really goodbut I am really tempted to get like theblue or the white but I'll have to seehow much like I actually wear them inthe summer but I feel like I'm gonnawear them a lot Mike and I are going onvacation in May we just booked our tripactually so I'm so excited to wear theseand then I guess I'll show you whatcomes in it like this is so like itcomes with like two separate shoe bags Ijust think is really funny it came withthis little booklet but their flip-flopsI think I know how to wear them and carefor them but on the same day I decidedto treat myself to a jo Malone fragranceover the years I've heard so much aboutthis brand you never want to actuallypurchase something and since I was atfoot running through to get the shoes Iwas like you know what let me just checkit out so the man working at the HoltRenfrew Montreal at the gym alonecounter he was really amazing veryinformative and he really had a lot ofpatience because I had never you knowbeen to a jo Malone counter so I'd neversmelled anything and he was like sopatient and like made me smell all ofthem so I decided to get a littlefragrance I had and get the wood sageand sea salt I got the 1 fluid ounce ofthe wood sage and sea salt and it was$80 so it is a little pricey for thislike small bottle I would recommend likeMac to aquatic or even Abercrombiefragrances seem to have it the same sortof vibe of the woods sage and sea saltthere was also this one it was likebluebells or something I was likeBluebell I don't knowand I smelt it and I really liked it butit really reminded me of the KimKardashian fragrance like her firstfragrance so I didn't get that one thenext thing I purchased was a pair ofray-bans you guys know I have a raybanaddiction which reminds me before I gointo this I decided that I'm going tosell my new Wayfarers I'll put a pricehere for them if you're interested youcan just email me at Ali's to Dallaswhite tea at yahoo.com I think I've wornthese like once or twice they're justreally not me you can choose between ablack and/or a brown case just because Ihave so many of them but yeah when Ibought these guys oh maybe I'm gonnawear them but no I'm a viateur I'm anaviator girl my vlog that I

anupdated sunglasses collection because Ido have a couple new pairs from thecollection video I did like last summernow I'm gonna talk about some Lululemonpurchases I've made recently I amaddicted to Lululemon I get so manyquestions about if I think it's worth itobviously I think it's worth it if Ihave like 20 pairs of leggings fromLululemonI haven't branched into like the tops orevery anything really but I love thebottoms they just are so hot quality andthey just feel like they hold me in andlike I'll wear like my leggings formaritza and I just feel like I'm justnaked like these just actually make mefeel betterthese are the first short pair of shortsI bought from Lululemon and they're theymake a move short I got a size 4 I'm asize 4 in Lululemon and I really likedthem just because of the side I don'tknow if you can tell but it kind of haslike it goes up like that I'm not goingto show you these because I've beenwearing them either kind of like plentyon you like a lint roll them I don'tremember the exact name I will link themdown below but they are a three-quarterlengths they do have the High Times andthose are the leggings that I wearbecause I'm 5 foot 3 so there's supposedto be a little bit cropped on like theaverage person but if you're short ifyou're shorter like me they do fit likeperfectly and I don't need to get themhemmed they're still a little bit longthat I don't need to like really getthem halves so I did find a pair thatwere a crop that actually looks crop iton me it hit me right where I wanted soyeah I also got these in a size 4 lovethem I love cropped leggings in thesummer I just love wearing them withlike all black and like my Nike issueswhich I'll link down below I said it somany questions about those nike shoesand now some things from Sephora I'mactually expecting a pretty largesupport order so I will include that inlike a vlog I've been vlogging a littlebit today but it's not here yet and Iwant to film this video so the firstthing I got from Sephora I've beenpretty you to like I don't want to takeskin care about yeah Heinemann intoskincare lately so this is the Bashamakeup breakup cool cleansing oil I usedto use the Biotherm makeup removing balmbig purchase out a couple of times and Ireally do like it it's really great fortravel because it's a balm so you don'thave to worry about it like leaking oranything like that but I had just runout of my bathroom and I wanted to trysomething different so this is a Bosch Imake up break up cool cleansing oil Ilike that was a pump that I didn't haveto dig my fingers in because I don'tknow there's just something aboutdigging my fingers into things I don'tlove I like it so farit takes off my makeup really easily theonly issue is with my mascara this is myfavorite mascara I actually justrepurchased this also this is a lashsensational luscious by Maybelline it'snot waterproof but it might as well bebecause it really sticks onto my lashesso I feel like even though I get all mymakeup off with this I do need to goback and put a little bit more on andreally rub into my eyes just becausediamonds got really sick some eyelashesbut I do really like this I don't knowmy sister has been using it too I guessbut yeah I don't know how long it'lllast because the biotherm lasts foreverI had that thing since like August andnow it's Johnny boots no it's notJanuary its Marchso it lasts a really long time actuallywhat I ordered in the Sephora order thatI'm expecting I got these Sunday Riley Ithink it's the blue moon face removerbomb or whatever be let me know if youguys to try this and if you like it thenext thing I got is this egg mousse packby too cool for school and it's a facialmask and it's really cool because itcomes out as a foam I wanted a maskbecause all my masks are really likepoor sucking masks like my ask a claymask and my glam glow masks like they'reall really intense like pulling out ofyour sole sorts of masks I wanted a maskthat was a little bit not like relaxedbut I would just pop it and put it onand I wouldn't feel like my skin wasabout to you know crack or anything likethat it's supposed to brighten your skinit's just a fun mask and it

duke fantastic to have youon this episode of leadership bites i'mincredibly excited andum you've gone for the uh european chicnoirswedish look and i've gone for the thebright lights oftrying to trying to be impressive butlovely to have you onit's great to be here yeah i do haveswedish roots my mom's swedish righti have like that you know stockholmnightclubaesthetic going right now and it's it'spre-sunrise here in california sothere's an irony in that well one ofthis is pulling off the style thing i'vegone for the uber professional look butyou know you've got the style thinggoing on looking goodthank you well compliments to each otherso listenduke i i reached out to you on you knowon linkedin you know that thatphenomenal moment of seeinguh a clip of yours which we'll get intoin a little bityou graciously replied i immediately didsome homework on youum through you know the medium of uhyou know typing you into search enginesand so i've got a real strong sense ofwho you arebut for those that don't know who dukestump isum and first first of all we we can'tnegate the fact that you have one of thegreatest names that's everbeen given you know and with a name likejuke stump you had to do something goodrightso well i will say thatthe name growing up is hard because youget there's a lot of ribbing going imean especially with the last namestump and so if you could just fightthrough thethe judgment and the bullying early onthen it's okay on the other end but thatin my youth it wasn't so great and whatwas the thinkingprocess behind that mom well actuallythe the my real name is first name isscottright but i was in grade schoolum and there was five scots in the classand the teacher said pick a nickname andi went home that dayand i'm not sure everyone's gonna knowthis program but it was calledgilligan's island it was just thetv series and it was a surfer guy thatwashed the shore on this deserted islandand his name was duke and i told my mommy name is duke and she's like okay mymom devlinsure i wanted to change my last name toobut they were like we're not having thatyou gottayou get one that's it that's the way itis sonso anyway yeah i've had it since theearly 70s so it's beenfeeling when i hear scott i know i'm introubleit's either like you know no oneaddresses me as scot unless it'ssomething formalso if i know if i send you an email withscott in it you know you'll payattention to that yeahthis is something that i need to beattending to solisten i'd just like to get a sense ofumfor people that don't know you uh andwhen i say who is dukeum what are you known for what is whatis the stuff thatwhen people do have a line of sight onyou they'll be alert to that history soa little bit of justum that that what you're known in theworld for it'd be great to hear ityeah i mean i i i think in onehand i'm actually known for being uhunreasonable and irrationallike my career choices i think a lot ofpeople are like scratch their heads likewho does thatand um you know professionally i'veworkedat really amazing places and emotionallychargedbeautiful cultures like nike now thatwas actually where i reallylearned i learned so much there actuallyand i was i spent 15 plus yearsa third of it in product i was in salesat one point inhawaii which you know obviously has beena bad bad gig butum i think it was just an amazing timeand andit's very few people leave nike butafter 15 plus years i felt i wasreally comfortable and wasn't growing soi left but it wasclear to me what i was curious about andi think curiosity is a common threadthroughout my lifei wanted to be a part of something supermeaningful and pioneering and so i wentto this place called seventh generationwhichum was a leader in corporateresponsibilities50 people 50 million dollars makingeco-conscious product andyou know there i did learn the role ofsoul in business and so whatappeared to be incredibly irrational tomy friendsi mean it was in fact an executive atnike had said i just committed careersuicide when i said i was leavingand i was like i'm really reallyconfident in this decisionit wasn't just like heat of the momentshift like i really thought it throughum but i in that nike it's interestingthere was a period there wheremy first job was called an econ it's oneof the most revered roles and it's nikespelled backwardsand the whole concept is you have toknow brand forwards and backwards andyou put into a marketplaceand you're the eyes and the ears and thevoice of the brand and i was in southerncalifornia so it was amazing you knowthat's my first job i'm youngbut one of the key things in that wasaboutsensing and signals like what are yousensing what are the signals that wouldsuggest what's emergingand so when you do a monthly report itwasn't like hey this is what's sellingit was likewhat are you sensing and i feel likethat's a practice that i've carried outthroughout my life andso going from nike to seventh generationwas easy because i was sensing man therewas this thing around corporateresponsibility andpioneering a new way of doing businessas a force of good that was interestingand when i went i then you know yearslater i went to lululemonto head up brand and primarily i'd beenin the world the roles of cmoor lululemon it was evp of brandoncommunitybut for me that was also an interestingadventure because one in the fall of2014 when i got there it was listed as abrand thatby wall street that wouldn't exist in2015. so it wasn't like a better rosesit had gone through some kind ofmercurial times but i was fascinatedwith therole of this thing called mindfulnessand what it means in our world and thatwas my curiosity at the timeand uh that was fun you know i spentthree and a halfyears there trying to in partnershipwith some amazing people within thatcompany tocreate the renaissance of this oncerevered brand and to bring it back andthat wasuh incredible and then most recently upuntil this past march i was at limewhich is a micro mobility and it wasn'tbecause i was fascinated with scootersin factwhen i first saw it in santa monica iwas like this is an absolute show like who what kind of businessis this because they were justeverywherebut when i got into the role thattransportationplays in human lives i was fascinatedaround transit deserts and transitequityand i was like wow like transportationi've never thought of itas this vehicle for enhancing human lifebut it'sincredibly powerful when it can be usedcorrectly so that's a long answer sayi've been in some really fascinatingplacesum i've learned a lotfrom things and a lot of things thathaven't gone well iactually don't i give all thosetough moments a big hug because i thinkthat's where a lot of my key learning isum and i'm have two grown amazing youngwomen as childrenwho are in uh one's out of universityone's in universityand my wife you know we've been together25 plus years she'si don't know if there's enoughsuperlatives i can share about who sheis and what she is other thanshe's a yogi and buddhist which is anamazing to have as a partner because shegrounds me when i you knowstart to lose it a little bitthat's um a great introduction so thankyou very much for thatum and when i i think one of theinterests i've got thethe podcast is called leadership rightssoit's elements of when leaders arere reflecting umwhat are the what can be or people thatwould like to be in a leadership rolewhat do they maybe need tothink about so for me my experience ofyouvicariously from a distance and theobservation of that isthat you know if you're heading up arole let's just take let's just takelike nike for examplethere's the span of control you've gotthere's the resources you've got and theexpectationsthat come with the role and then there'sthei guess what it is that you stand forandthe the following you as a personand i'm just wondering in your growthhas that been what maybe that thatthat understanding of maybe at first wasit fulfilling the roletrying to get the task done but actuallyi've learned or what i'm hearing thereis thatthe experience of me and what that meanswhat i'm offering to peopleand have you ever had to balance that orif you had moments where that's becomemoreimportant to you or realizing thatyeah so a couple things one isi don't think financials are a predictorof success i think i do reallyfundamentally they're a function ofdoing these other things well andso a lot of those other things iscreating an environment and culturewhere there'sempathy um where there's curiosityum where there's courage um wherethere's trustand so for me i've been fortunate i'vehad great mentors like i had one mentorwho saidyou any role you get in leadership youshould make yourselfdisplaceable you know and at first i waslike why would i do that i want toyou know i'm trying to get you knowmaybe to this position and she'sshe was like no just act asact as if you your job is to be makeyourself displaced but because then thebehavior becomeshow do i actually nurture and cultivatethose aroundaround the team in this in my role andmy functionto grow and whether you're displaceableor not is kind ofis not really the point the point isthat there's a behavior shift so it'sless aboutterritorial and you know my friend hasthis amazingbelief that as you grow up in the in anycompany and up the ladder that youbecome more and more of a sociopathand you forget what it's like to behuman in the world of businessand for me ii it's no different than parenting alittle bit i want to be able to mentorbut i also want to be mentored so i lovecreating environments wherei'm constantly growing from those aroundme on on my team and i've been fortunatemore often than notthat's the case and so and i've neverreally sought a job i've never said whattitle do i want i've really morei generally am like hey this seems likea really interesting place to beyou know and then i'm generally land ina brand role or whatever butand i think the last thing for me is umi i like environments where people canbe their effortless selveswhere they can just show up and not be acog in the wheel but be recognized i'man introvert by nature and being anintrovert especially in a c-suiteit's hard as hell because you sit thereand you justtake it all in and you know krishnamurtiis a famous philosopher here in ojai andhe would always say beware the man whoknowsand i would write that in my notebook inmeetings all the time because i was likea reminder likestay curious stay curious they'recurious and umand so i'd like to think that i have anand create an environment where peoplefeel there'spsychological safety that they'retrusted and they're empoweredand they're pushed in a good healthy wayumyeah but it's i just think at the end ofthe day i'm really obsessed with what itmeans to be human in business and i feellike that's just somehowlike exited uh the world right nowso one of the things that i know you'reworking on i think you just launchedis bonfire with seoul yeahdot com um which i know one of myuh colleagues has already signed up forand i'll make all sure all the links areinthe podcast notes um i'd love to hearabout that becausethat's what triggered me to call you isaw on mylinkedin feed that video which againi'llmake sure there's a link to uh and itgrabbed me i mean the production qualitywas exceptional which i'd expectnow that i know what you're about but itthe nature of itcaught me it wasn't the productionquality but it was the nature of itit reached into me and made me go oh mygoodness so i'dit's obviously a passion and i'd love tojusthear what it is to you and if iif i was going to pay attention to itwhy why wouldn'twhat i get out of it yeahwhat's important is a little bit of theback story sogrowing up early in my youth in themidwest my parents were high schoolteachers um in the late 60s and early70s andum so i think there was this teachingwaslike within my my dna if you willand then during the financial crisis ihad created my own company but itaught at a couple graduate schoolsand hands down those were the mostrewarding experience you knowteaching for me was like it was a loveaffair i was mentoring and i was beingmentored but i wasalso infusing into the that not aplaybook but a philosophy around what ibelieved around businessand it was an outlier approach for sureit wrinkled some feathersyou know i i would say i thinkcompetition is an archaic thoughtyou know and yet in business schoolyears first thing you're taught is heylet's go into thecompetition slide and so in januaryuh my wife and i always do this exerciseof imagine a day and it's like your twofeet hit the ground and you're excitedabout today so what does the day looklike andi it was visceral for me i was like iwant to teach againi just and a lot of it stemmed from thefact thati'm as i'm in the bowels of businessi'm just watching what's happening andthen i read thisstudy that she said 85 percent of peopleare not engaged at work81 of people would find a new job if onecame upand less than a third of people feltthere was a great culture andi was like man my foeis business schools that teach thisarchaic way of thinking and my fault isthe acceptancethat of the status quo like we spent somuch time of our lives in the workingworld and so i thinkthe mere thought that someone would notfeel engaged at workwas unsettling for me and soi left lyme in march and then i was likeyou know what like i have thisthis itch to share this philosophy tothe world likewhat better time to do than than now andi initially thought i wouldwant to teach at a graduate school butthe more i looked at the curriculumand the the framework in which i had tooperate i was likei want to break the rules that bind idon't want to be a part of thisand so i've served up this course calledbonfires with seouland it's uh 12 principlesthat um but they're built around storyand real lifeexperiences and soi want to be able to share with theworld the news i don't think the worldneeds another business school businessschool course i needed i think it needsa new school of thoughtand my vision and hope is that thisphilosophy isn't the end-all be-all butthat itit sparks a revolution for people thatare questioningbusiness like once againi want introverts to thrive in businessand being an introvert in business ispretty damn hard you know it's likewhoever can talk the loudest or make themost statements and i wantinquiry to thrive and you know uh whatdoes you choose to saywasn't the answers we had right it wasthe questions we had wrong i want peopletolive in a sense of inquiry all the timeand be in observance andin this course what's interesting is mymentors are not businessmy mentors are nature i'm i've been apart of something called biomimicrywhich is like ask naturewhich is an amazing thing founded byjanine beniusin the 90s i've been i was on the boardfor actually eight yearsmy mentors are horsemanship think horsewhispermy mentors are buckminster fuller yogakrishna morty here in ojai and so i liketo bring inpoetry um i like to bring in a differentinflux of thinkingbecause and it's not my nature to be anantagonist so i want to be an inspiredprotagonistaround just challenging convention inthe status quo in a way that can open upa different conversation and hopefullydifferent behaviorso um is this aimedat well let me rephrase that question sowho would you liketo pay attention to thisyeah it's great ques it's a greatquestion i don't it's interesting iit's not a demographic in fact eveneverywhere i've gone i'mi think demographics are an interestingpiece but they're a subseti think the main thing more for meeverywhere gone is what's the mindsetthat uh we want to connect with andi feel like we've termed it theoptimistic rebel and it's the nextgeneration of business leaders who arelike man i know there's a better wayi can sense it or see it or whatever buti refuse to acceptthe status quo i'm just not sure and sothat mindset it's really for bonfiresoul is an introduction into this otherpathso anybody thatin my space the leadership space thatwould be potential talent of peoplewanting to move into managementleadership roles all the way through toa c-suite group of people very muchcould be the audience for thisuh absolutely i mean um i i will sayi haven't i think deep down i'm not sureit'll be a lot of c-suite people becausewhat i've seen in c-suite isthere's not really a beginner's mindaround much and it's like you get tothis place and thenall curiosity inquiry kind of evaporatesand so it'sit's probably for the next generation ofbusiness leaderum and you know i've seen registrationalready some c-suite people so i'm notknocking that i love what i just wishthere was more curiosity around itumyeah so anyways it's um and it's alsothe other thing the key thing isi've been a i've used this philosophy inpublic companiesprivate companies small companies bigcompaniesi'm on the board of several non-profitsandit's the same philosophy and sowhat i share is that it has no bias likeit doesn't you don't have to be a bigcompany a small company or public or aprivate or a proprofit or non-profit it is i believeand i've borne witness to it over thelast 30 plus years that it'sit's applicable and accessible really toanybody that wants theis open to a new way of thinking andwhat i expect to findi need to start asking better questionsnot close questions buti suppose the question is you know whatdo i find within the course what do iwhat is the learning that i can expectto receive that might reinforce the goodmight calibrate where i'm close butcould be better or what what mightfundamentally bring me challengebut the the heartbeat of bonfire withsoul is really aboutuh culture brand and leadership andmy hope and my intentionis to invite a different way or adifferent lens of how we look at a lotof differentthings so for example you know ithe first principle is product is amirror into your soul andmy what i share is that if you don'thave a great productthe rest of the 11 principles aresomewhat mutedum that said i think it's less aboutalways a physical productyou know or a digital product and aproduct is every touch pointso bonfire was sold and we've beenmaniacal aboutevery touch point so for example wecreated a manifesto bookand then we're like all right wellwhat's the packaging oh it's going to goin the post and we're like well that'snotreally is that really what we want to doand then the teamat the do lectures who i've partneredwith you know they're like hey we'regoing to put it in this box withkindling and it's going to be a stickerlike here's your fire starter kit and somy point is that like on product forexample like you it's not about creatinga product team it's about creating aproduct culture and it's recognizingthatevery single touch point mattersand you're defined by everything you dowell and everything you do not so welland unfortunately the latterhas sometimes more impact on people thanthe formerum you know and then i look at ichallenge thewhole idea of competition you know atnike we didn't we didn't talk aboutcompetition becausewe recognized that we weren't in thebusiness of making sneakers and teas wewere in the business of bottlinginspirationand that that was a completely differentjet stream thanhow everyone else was playing and so wejust we were like you know what theworld needs now that we're most uniquelyqualified to deliver is inspirationand innovation so let's do thatad nauseam but just evolve it and so asan exampleif you think about nike umyou know obviously it's createdinspiration on thethe pitcher and the sports arenas in thefields but then it's done it withthe girl effect which was an incrediblyeffectivebody of work from nike and it's become aun resolution about the role ofeducationfor for women it did a lot of work onif you let me play back in the late 90sabout letting young girls the role assports plays in the lives of youngwomen as they grow up it was about colinkaepernickyou know taking a stance and that waslevel of inspiration but that simpleidea ohyou know i think i just to me whenyou're obsessed with competition itcreates a culture of fearbecause you're looking at what othersare doing constantly and there becomesangst andanxiety where when you play with anunbridled passion aroundthis like open territory mosaic for youthen it's then it's fun i meanwhen i got to lululemon it was a toughtime and i remember people like oh lookat what these other brands are doing i'mliketime out time out just put that to thesideand we said what do what'swhat business uh do we need to be in andthrough the help of some amazing peoplewe got to this place of hey the worlddoesn'tneed to do yoga it needs to be yogaso how can we show that yoga shows up inyou knowyoga is more than just on the map that'sasana is just oneof the eight limbs of yoga there's sevenother amazing limbs that actuallyreinforce what it means to be human inthis in this world andshows up every day compassion empathywhateverso let's let's begin to adventure downthat path and then thatwas just like a rocket ship it was likewe just took offand so in terms of the learning i'msharing what i believe are thefundamentalthings that are not about financialfinancials but thethe thinking and the attitude and thebehavior that will deliver those butalsomore importantly deliver a real vibrantculturein the community both inside and outsideof your your brand or your companyso i'm i'm really feeling a sense ofhumanity in play here anda real kind of umyou know one of the things i often seein businesses is this phrase corporatesocial responsibilityand i've often said can we just lose theword corporateyou know and just call it socialresponsibilityand there's there's something here whichis you there's something here which ismaybe bigger than youin the sense of where potentiallysomething like this could go buti imagine that there'sum this is about people'ssense of relationship with themselvesthis is about the permissions they givethemselves andwhere they want to put their energy andtheir focus anddealing with their fear i guess of do ihave the right as a human being well idobut am i given a space to be humanand and it's a it's i can sense thatthere's athere's a lot of challenge in this so isthis program veryin terms of the experience of it is itmodular-led is itfrom um other conversations i imaginelistening to a video or watching amodulewould trigger so much potentialneed for greater conversation how doesthatwhere does that go and and how does theprogram or if it does deal with thatbecause there's a trigger point and thenthere's my need to talk about ityeah i mean humanness is at the heart ofhow i holdof so many things i mean i've alwaysquestioned and it's aquestion i'll never be able to fullyanswer but it's like what does it meanto be humanand when we were developing bonfire withsoul initially it was like hey we'regoing to do these zoom calls butgoing back to product is a mirror toyour soul i was worried about a couplethings i was worried about technicalglitchesbut i also wanted to romance thestorytelling throughmusic and b-roll footage and i wantedpeople to feellike what these things haven't come tolifethe other piece was i wanted tocomplement each principlewith another real life example frompeople i've knownthat can share their story and you cansee it and it'swe've added these podcasts once againwith uh musicand b-roll and so for example in thisthe principal wrong live empathyuh khalila is this amazing evp of hrtrue colors which who's pioneering a newway of looking at hrall built around empathy and so there's12 hours ofcontent recorded buti also want to have that interaction andsoum the course runs over three weeks itopensup with a live uh global zoom callwhere i just kind of say hey here's whatto expect and quick introi might have my wife do some breathingexercise at the start just to get usgroundedum and then in one week you drop arecordingof the principal you get the podcast butthen we also have aweekly q a zoom and i'vewe offer it up three times or two timesso that it's time zone appropriate[Music]and then there's a slack channel andit's been funny like the slack channelright nowis already on fire because it's acommunity of people i think that aresuper likei ca i give anybody credit right nowwho's registered for this course becausethey probably don't know me they're notreally sure exactly what imean they have a sense of what i'm goingto offer but they're not exactly sure sothey're insanely curiousum you know we've also made it likemoney back guarantee if you don't likeit like i don't want anyone to feel likethis waswasting my time so and ii don't believe that's going to be truebut if it is like that's that's finethati really just want people to walk awaylike damn that exceeded my expectationsum and so i'm actually going to bepretty active on slackum you know i imagine there's going tobe a lot of questions as well and thenwe close witha reflections global zoom where we justyou know i love to close withreflections in meetings and it's justlike okaywhere are we at what do we see what isthis where what what does this mean andkind of how to what what's next if youwillum and i will say the other thing iswe're ahead of our projections andregistrations which is super encouragingit um it ends tomorrowi think at midnight um but i think whati'm mostimpressed with is it's global i meanthere's it'sit's asia it's the pacific region it'sthe ukit's the you know germany franceswitzerlandus canada theit's i love the globalnature of it all and even thethere's no um set profile of people thathave registered it's people from allwalks of life doing all sorts ofdifferent thingsand do you expect to roll this as a as acontinual program if the need is therewe do we do i think this you knowit's been a pretty good investment oftimebut also finance you know like iinvested in recordings i invested in thepodcastum and so i think for us it was likehey we've we have all these things nowpackaged together why wouldn't we justcontinue tointroduce this so that you know as manypeople as possiblecan experience it we've also by the wayin this first onewe've done two price points we've donethe suggested price pointand then we've also recognized that it'sa really tough time in the world rightnowand um so we offered another price pointand we let people decidewhich one a lower price point they candecide which one they want toselect okay um but yeah i wouldone of the principles is the beauty ofnot knowing we created this this becausewe felt it was right for this momentand where it goes in the future i reallydon't know and i'm not sure we're tryingtodynamically steer it anyway we'll know alot after this first coursewell um i'm going to shout out to a ladycalled deandra who iknow will listen to this because thenshe'll go gold blind i can't believe youjust said my namebut i have because i showed her the clipand she wentwow and she's she said i've literallyi'm signingup before the video finishedso that's indicative of the impact thati think it could uh haveso i'm gonna sort of shift us away fromthat just for a moment um but i was socaught by it that i wanted to give itgood air time umand i guess i can imagine peoplethat intellectually emotionally buy intowhat it is that a you represent but alsowhat it is that you're offering within aprogram such as thisand i wonder if you ever have peoplethat intellectually buy into thisthinkingbut have a fear they fear what theymight see as the lackof permission orlicense or space to be themselvesin organizations that arebewitched by their agenda of thefinancialsand you know that's the kind of that'sthe kind of talk that doesn't really flyhereand i wonder um how thatyou know i don't know if it's advice orthe conversation that you might havewith people that goduke i get it and i'd love to do so buthave you seen where i work or have youmet my bossand i just wonder how that sits andmaybethe conversation that you have aroundthat sometimes because i imagine it mustcome upwell i can i have deep sense of empathybecause that's been mylife truthfully so i've had thisphilosophy or thesethoughts around things i think moreoften than notthe most challenging part of where i'vebeen in the different adventures isinternally not externallyit's getting people to see feel andtrust like that there's this way andi mean you know like when i got toseventh generation you know i thinkpeople first were likewho is this dude like what the hell ishe talking about or even at lou lemon iremember when we were doingthis campaign called this is yoga whichwas to reallyshare with the world why this brainmattered in a different waymy own peers and maybe rightfully sowe're like i don't get it like whatwhat's the return what's the revenuegonna be and i wouldtell them like i don't know what therevenue is gonna beyou know and so i ishare that because it takes courage likei don't want to settleyou know because i'm i feel like you cando an amazing mostrevolution start from the bottom up andi feel like if enough people startvoicingtheir needs in a different way or theirwants and desiresbeyond just the acceptance of thingsum i think that's the only way we'll goabout creating change truthfullyand it's not easy and i'm just you knowthere's been days where i'vehave been at companies where i feel likei'm salmon you know i swam upstreami fought i spawned and then i just diedyou know and then it's like okaylike on to another adventure but[Music]i go back to i don't i don't thinkanyone wants to just existin work i think they want to feel aliveand i would feel like that's worthfighting foreven if it meant truthfully having toughconversations withbosses or whatever becausethe the pain of accepting the status quoto me is fargreater than any pain that could comefrom that conversationso what is the revolution what's thewhat's the end game i thinki shouldn't say i think my belief isthat the my belief is the revolution isthat we recognizein business the role of what it means tobe humanwhen we create a culture of empowermentand trust when we live in a culture ofempathy you know and yoga namastevladimir is the light of you when wetake the time to understand people i bowto the divine in youyeah like so for example when i doone-on-one meetingslike at lululemon they weren't aboutbusiness primarily they were like what'sgoing onwith you and what's important like whereare you and we would have just reallyrobust conversations and so therevolution isrecognizing financials are not thepredictor of success but if you can dotheseother things while create a culture ofempathy create a culture of couragecreative culture ofof trust challenge howwe look at the business currentmechanical road business modelslike then you have this amazing capacityto do incredible thingsit's no different think of if you're ina theater group or on a sports teami mean i love the i'm just a typicalamerican i'm terrible at uhpremier league football so my apologiesbut when ilisten to is it klopp the i know knowmore about football than you doi'm aware there's a ramble involved andthat's where i top outyeah i just leadersi think vulnerability like how often dowe bring vulnerabilityinto uh the workplace like in theworkplace you all suddenly have to showup with a sense ofarmor in this map and then oh works overand then i can like take it all off andi'm likescrew that i want people to show up astheir effortless selvesevery day i want people i want to invitea diversity of thought and race andgender and ethnicity so that there'sthis like amazingsoil rich soil of microbes that can justchallengeyou know uh things and and yetbusinesses become monoculture monocrop thinking um we have this belief youknowlike that there's this hierarchy ofyou know as you get older or up theladder you're the wise one and thereality is some of the best thinking issprinkled throughoutany company culture in the most amazingplaces and soi just wanted i would love for companyto be human againand that goes back to me like trust andempathy and couragei love it i think it i think it's verypowerful i thinksome things come along for the righttime at the at the right timeand this this definitely is one of thosethings that without having experiencedit which i'mi'm gonna try and do um it reallyresonatesum is there anything else that you'reinvolved in that issomething that you want to talk about oractually if i sort of sayi know this is sort of very real rightnow butum where are you headed wheredo you have a sense of you knowi may not have every stepping stonestarted but i think over the next xamount of years where i'm trying to getto isyeah perhaps i'm anoutlier in this thinking but i don'twork from likethis big purpose of set of goalsi work on what i'm curious aboutand then i just invite and start ituh stay tuned to opportunity from thereand sofor me right now i'm i'm really enjoyingthis bonfire with soulendeavor i have no idea where it will goor won't gotruthfully so that's um you know that'smy own invitation into the unknown umbut i love the unknown whichyou know in human culture we weloathe uncertainty and i'mi'm actually the opposite i'm i'm likeman this is like there's you know chrischristian morty the philosopher says uhto know is to be in prisonto not know us to be free and so i'mjust curious and what i'm curious rightnow is the role ofhumanists in business i'm also supercurious about educationum in how like i'm on the board of thisamazing k-12 school here in ojaiwhich is incredibly uniquemy daughters went there and i feel likethey get it in terms of howthe role of education is to nurture andcultivate the whole child and the wholestudent not justknowledge based there's this other levelof learning that needs to happenum and so we'll see you knowi haven't i haven't been eager to jumpback in the business worldbecause i feel likewhere i need to be right now is thisinspired protagonist trying toyou know spark a different level ofthought andi don't i don't know where it will gobut i embrace thati think if you do a book i think that'syou that's your titlethe inspired protagonistyeah yeah it's funny myi don't think anything gets solvedthrough anger or hate orloathing i think it just exasperates adivideand so my whole thing is if i it's ilearned a lot of this even at nike youknow it wasn't uhwhen nicki was born fitness was likeronnie was like geez and crow who wantsto run but if you can inspireyou know you don't say hey get your assout there and start runningyou inspire people to run that'sdifferentlike we used to have this thing at nikeis if you saw anyone running on the sideof the road regardless ofhow slow fast whatever body shape youalways just give them a thumbs upyou just like yeah okay yeah i get whatyou're trying to doyeah and so for me i don'ti have a foe which once again isbusiness schoolsand the acceptance of the status quo buti want the body of work to be inspiringand so as an inspired protagonist not anantagonist that's important to me welllisteni'm hugely alert to your timeuh and i'm i'm you knowunder the right circumstances i couldkeep going on to the point where you goguy i really do need to go nowso i'm going to be really alert to thatum and i'm just going to thank you foryour time um you know it's given a bitof an insight into youit'll introduce you to some people thatyou know may not bealert to your work and i'm definitelygoing to you knowmake sure it gets as far as i can kindof put put it out thereum and and you know with your permissioni'll reach out andmaybe there's a phase two on this withwhere where you're going andwhat's happened and um you know thatthat could be really interestingfor people as as well so um so on thatnote i'm going to say thank you so muchand just ask you just to hang on for aminute when i press stop on the recordbutton just to make sure nothing goeswrong butduke thank you so much for your timeright thank youthank you thank you thank you indeed,22,UCeSBzLKJoakPuIocFiE7ozA,Guy Bloom,0,0,0,1,"['Duke Stump', 'Bonfire with soul', 'Nike', 'LuluLemon', 'Lime Scooters']","Duke Stump, Nike,

hey everyone what's up so for today'svideo I am filming a huge collectivehaul I have accumulated a bunch ofdifferent things over the past few weeksand if you hear any pitter patter in thebackground that is my dog Jay Gatsby andI am sorry but I don't want to let himoutside it's too hot and it's reallyimportant not to let your dog overheatbut yeah I've been accumulating thesethings for the past few weeks and Iwanted to finally get this haul video upso I could put the stuff away andactually wear it because it's just beensitting on my floor um it's kind of aback-to-school inspired theme but keepin mind that I do go to school in LA andI go to college so things that I mightbe more appropriate that I would wear toclass might not be appropriate for thoseof you who are in high school or middleschool or go to schools that have strictdress codes so yeah let's just go aheadand get started um I went to Backman'sBody Works recently and they weren'thaving any major sales which kind ofsucks because I feel like Bath & BodyWorks is always having sales so I onlybought one candle which is upstairs andI just really can't be bothered rightnow to go and get it but I got the lemonand tea candle and it smells soincredibly good it kind of reminds me ofthe Anthropology candles so do theyneeded soap and this is the turquoisewater soap I really do like this scent Ihave box soap and this scent before it'sjust really fresh and really clean andit's cute it goes with my apartment so Ibought those and then I also boughtthese foxy lady socks and they are theShea infused lounge socks but I probablywill get more use out of in the coldermonths to come but these were only 850and they have the non-skid like siliconebeating at the bottom which is nice aswell and then I bought two plugins Ibought the turquoise water scent againand then I bought the Sunset Beach isjust one of my favorites from last yearand then I just bought a plugin for mywall with the turquoise detailingbecause it goes with my apartment andthat is all that I bought from Bath &Body Works and then moving on to themore like random stores that I didn'tfind that many thingsfrom um from PacSun I never really findtoo many things at PacSun just becausethe style there isn't really my tasteall the time but I do like their shortssometimes so I picked up one of theirshorts this is the bull head denim Cothe slouchy shorts and this is an armygreen color which is really fun for thefall and also the summer because armygreen is probably going to be a reallybig color for the season and it has alittle bit of distress in the frontwhich is my favorite I love when jeansor pants have a lot of distressing andthen the back they're not too sure aswell which is nice as well and I thinkthese were $40 and then from Topshop Ipicked up a few sunglasses but I leftthem in LA so I'm sorry I can't showthem right now in this haul but I alsobought this shirt it is just a regularbasic like muscle style tank top whichis really nice um you'll probably see atrend in this video the things that Ibought I really gravitate towardsneutral colors so like black white greyand I'm trying to incorporate more armygreen because I really do like thatcolor as well but that's just what Itend to like and then also I like toreally high net like things on a dailybasis just because I find that it'sreally flattering for my figure and it'sjust easy so I bought a lot of those sothis might be a little bit boring I wasreally excited to buy this I bought thisin a size two and I think this wastwenty dollars as well and then frompink in Victoria's Secret I only boughtthree things I think yeah so I boughtthis shirt which is a basic likelong-sleeve cotton ombre pink shirtwhich I thought would be fun just tolike throw on when I don't care aboutwhat I look like and I'm just runningout the door which is basically everyday of my life and I think this wasaround $40 I have worn it so I'm sorry Idon't have the tag still on and this Ibought in an extra-small because it isquite oversized as is and then I pickedup one set of bikini bottoms and this iswhat they look like they have the littlestraps and detailing on the side whichis really niceand they are a little bit more likescandalous so they're a little bit moreof like the like bootie style if theyhave a little bit of ruching in the backand these were 30 to 50 so a little bitmore expensive and I bought these in asize small because I didn't want thestraps to be hugging my side facts Ibought one bikini top this is a bandeaustyled one it has like really cutescalloped detailing I don't know if youcan see that but um yeah it comes with astrap so you can wear it as a halter andthis I bought from the pink store for Ithink like twenty three dollars andthat's all that I bought from Victoria'sSecret and then from a little likeboutique II like kiosk II shop thing onthe promenade so there's all these so onthe third tree Promenade in Santa Monicathere's a bunch of stores but in themiddle there's always these the kiosksand little booths and there's this oneparticular store which I really can'tremember I'm sorry but if it comes to meI will put it in the bottom bar belowbut they sell it's a permit store it'salways there and it has a bunch of myboho chic clothing so I bought thisblack maxi dress from there it's just ahigh-neck maxi dress but it's really funbecause in the back there's all thislike really fun crisscross detailingwhich you probably won't be able to seeso it goes pretty low on your back soyour entire back is basically exposedbut all you can see is like the reallycool crisscross detailing which isreally pretty and I really like this andthis was I think $40 from Macy's one ofthe my favorite things that I purchasedrecently is actually this and this is along like lightweight army green jacketbut it's not kind of like your like armymilitary inspired jacket even thoughit's an army green collar because it's alittle bit more chic than that I thinkit's pretty long it goes past my waistand then it has a gold zipper detailingand I just absolutely love this I thinkit's a fun little twist on like acardigan or a blazer and this was ahundred dollars for Macy's so a littlebit more pricey I bought this isn't asize small and this is the bar threebrand as well if you're interested and Ijust bought this so hopefully they stillhave it in stores and then moving on toNordstrom's I bought just a few thingsfrom there the first being this shirtactually and I bought the shirt and adifferent color as well so I'll show itto you and this this is a free peoplejust basic tank top like I said I reallylike the high necked things I think it'sreally flattering on me and this one's alittle bit more slouchy so for the daysthat you don't feel like sucking inwhich is pretty much like everyday forme this is a good option so this is justthe army green color this is $20 and Ibought mine in a size small andobviously I bought the gray version aswell and then I also picked up twobracelets they are the ounce and a kneebracelets I haven't ever purchased anyof them before but I'm trying to getmore into jewelry so I decided to buythese um I bought the turquoise versionand a little heart locket because mybest friend has the keys so I thoughtthat'd be a good idea and I bought thesein gold I think these were like $30 andthen I also bought these MIDI rings fromthe BP section it comes with three asyou can tell I'm really into rings whichis actually something else that I boughtso I bought a few of these two fromFrancesca's and then I bought themajority of these from forever 21 andthen I bought this run from the BPsection as wellso these are just MIDI rings these weremy six dollars and then I also purchasedanother new bra ultra light which I loveI've talked about these before they'remy absolute favorite things to wear forsticky bras and I just neednew ones so that's what I've got this Ithink was like $40 so a little bitpricey but definitely worth it because Iget a lot of wear out of mine and then Ialso but actually I think that's itthat's all the things that I bought fromNordstrom's moving on to brandy melvilleI picked up the same shirt but in threedifferent colors which is kind ofembarrassing but that's just how I rollapparently I bought this shirt so itkind of looks like with shirt that I'mwearing so like I said I'm really boringum but it's a little bit different it umhas really low like armpit holes and itfits a little bit tighter than the freepeople lines and it's a little bitshorter as well it's kind of a moreclassy twist on whole wife-beater in myopinion but this is really flatteringand it's great just to wear it to classso I bought it in gray I also bought itin black and then I also bought it andwhite right it's super fun um these were15 dollars and then I also bought thistank top which I already own but I wouldjust need to replace mine because it'sgetting kind of gross and stains andthis is only $14 it's a veryboobalicious shirt so you can wear itout if you're trying to show off yourboobs or you can wear it down with likeor dress it down with like a bralettewhich is nice and then I bought theseshorts and these aren't my favorite butI really just needed a black pair ofshorts for the summer and these are kindof what I had in mind but I wish they'rea little bit more distressed but they'renot um these are just a very basic pairof shorts there's no distressing like Isaid and they're not too short which isnice and I think these were $40 and thenI also bought this shirt right here andit's very distressed so it has like thepurposeful like holes in them and ripswhich i think is kind of cool I alreadyown a shirt like this but in the darkgray so I thought a white would just benice to have for the Fall and this was$25 lastly from brandy melville I boughta pair of pants so I hold the pair oflight washed boyfriend jeans from brandymelville and anger those all the time soit's really excited to see that theycame out with a white version of themand they're basically the same exactpants there's the same repeats andeverything so they fit a little bitlooserthere's the ripping in the back andthey're very very distressed and you canroll them up on the bottom which is whatI tend to do I really really love thesethese were $45 and I bought these and asize small the extra small fit but theyweren't as big as I would like them tobe so that's why I decided to size upand those are all the things that Ibought from brandy melville moving on tourban outfitters I picked up fivedifferent things from them one of themis the bralette that I'm wearing I havehauled this before I think it's justlike the halter bra let's I bought it ingray as well but the thing about these Ireally really love these especiallysince I wear the high next shirt so itjust goes well with like these type oftank tops they tend to pill really badwhich really sucks but they're onlytwenty dollars and so I just need toreplace mine and I also wanted tointegrate so I bought the suicidesmedium I also fit in the size smallwhich was the size of my last ones but Ithought that the besides medium just wasa little bit more comfortable and not astight and these are $20 and I reallyreally do love these and then I alsobought this dress and this is just alike very high net again black dressit's very basicit's very flowy and it's not much shapeto it but it's really nice just an easydress to like throw on to class or ifyou're running out for some errands andthis was $49 and I bought mine and asize small and I think this is justreally flattering it's just really cuteand easy to wear as well but this dressI am really really excited about it'skind of like the same as the same dressthat I just showed you it's kind of asame concept but a little bit differentit's an army green color it's very highnecked as well as you can tell I'mreally into that it's kind of a coollike scrunchie like t-shirt detailingand the lining of the dress is shorterso it goes above your knees but theactual fabric that overlays that goespast your knees so it's a really cooldress I think it's pretty edgy it's kindoflike a Kylie Jenner kardashian styledone that they would probably wear Ithink I have seen Kylie wear one and Ijust think this would be really coolwith a pair of like nude heels and maybea jacket for the fall up it's colder andI just love this I bought this in a sizesmall and this was a $54 so those areall the things that I bought from UrbanOutfitters I'm almost done with my hullI believe hang in there last fixturethat I went to is Lululemon and I boughta lot of things from there because Idon't feel like I've purchased a lot ofthings from Lululemon recently so Iobviously needed to stock up because Iobviously don't have enough stuff hahathat was a jokeand the first thing that I bought isthis I've talked about these tank topsbefore these are my favorite this is theswiftly racerback and I bought thesuper-sized four and this was $48 I justreally liked the print of this so I wasreally excited to sign that the nextshirt that I bought is actually arepurchase just in a different color andthis is the wild tank so in the front itjust looks like a very basic and flowyblack and gray striped tank top but inthe back it's really really fun becauseyour entire back it's exposed except forthe sports bra detailing in the frontwhich is really cute I don't know if youcan see that and then all the fabricgathers above your waist which is reallyfun as wellthis was $64 and I bought this in a size6 because um the sports bra I needed tobe a little bit bigger than a size 4 soyeah and then I also bought this jacketand I'm really really happy to buy thisI wear my other black scuba jacket allthe time it gets a lot of wear out of itso I wanted to buy another one I boughtthis in a size 6 because I like it to bea little bit more oversized but stilllike fitted but I don't like it to becompletely restraining and this is thescuba hoodie - and this was $108 so alittle bit more expensive but thequality of this jacket is really reallyamazing and it's really warm and it's anice slick twist here regular like forface or something like that so then thelast thingoh not blasting um one of the last twothings that I bought from Blue eleven ifyou have watched my Lululemon collectionhaul videos um you know that I'm reallynot interested in their shorts at allbut I decided to give them another trythese are the run speed shorts and Ibought this in a size four and theyretail for $54 they're just a black andthey have a nice zipper in the back andthey're pretty short but not too shortbut I really liked the material of theseand I haven't tried this on so hopefullyI liked them so fingers crossed and thenthe last thing I bought I'm probably themost excited about this and these arethe run inspired cropped to pants Ibought these in a size 4 and they retailfor 96 dollars and again

everyone its Cathy welcome back to mychannel didn't vixen today I have a haulfor you I went to the desert a coupleweeks ago with a girlfriend we did areally small little girls weekend awayit was just the two of us and we didthings that I don't normally get to dowhen I'm with my husband becauseobviously you know he has otherinterests if it was up to me all I woulddo is go out to eat and shop the wholetime and then maybe hang out by the pooland then read a book now when I go tothe desert with him he's got you knowhe's guy he's got guy things that hewants to do so shopping is not numberone in his list but one of thehighlights of going to Palm Springs fromwhere I live here in Newport Beachto Palm Springs there is an outlet mallon the way and I so rarely get to stopthere when my friend suggested that westop and check out the Lululemon outletthere it was all over that since lasttime I was there I did do quite a bit ofdamage especially at that LululemonOutlet it's probably a good

and so when I do shop I try toremember what I got set it aside andthen kind of just make one big haulvideo when I have enough stuff to showyou so let's get started first thingsfirst let's talk Lululemon I kind ofstarted that off as a teaser let's justjump right into it I went to the doctorgosh really recently and I actuallydidn't need the doctor to tell me thisbut I've put on a coupleand I need to get it off but I just amnot feeling super inspired to work outyou know I kind of go back and forthwith that I used to go through phaseswhere I work out a lot and then I wouldjust kind of die off and I was able tomaintain the weight back in the day nowthat I'm you know pushing 50 let's justsay it's a little harder to gosh keepthat weight off it's just so annoyingand frustrating so anyway I decided thatthe inspiration I needed was to get somenew workout clothes I have enough pantsI have a lot of the workout pants youknow the leggings and you know justdifferent styles of workout pants Idecided that I needed shorts this timebecause I do travel a lot it's easy topack shorts it's so much easier theytake a blessed room in your suitcase anda lot of times they end up in placesthat are warm like say Honolulu Ihaven't been there in a while but I'mopen knock on wood to be there againreally soon but when I'm there and I Ilike to walk and and hike and do thatfor workout instead of going into theworkout room or the gym and it's warmthere so shorts are a really good thingto workout in when you're going toplaces like Hawaii so I found these Ilove these these are running shorts Ithink these are adorable I love the hotpink colorLululemon always has such cute stuff andit fits really well and I resisted itfor a long time because I thought it wasway overpriced and yes it is wayoverpriced but um it's a little lessexpensive at the outlet mall not a wholelot but a little less but definitely anydiscount I get I will take these arejust really really cute I love thislittle pocket back here you can put yourwell I say travel a lot you can put yourroom key in there see look I got a size10 it's just to show you I've put on acouple pounds I'm normally an 8 but it'salso nice to have clothes it fits you soanyway these are really cute and ofcourse everyone likes to see the littlelogo so the little Lululemon logo is right there on the side sothese hot pink running shorts should getme into the mood to at least go walkingif not running and then I found this nowthese aren't the little skirts that youget at Lululemon it says that it is arunning skirt my girlfriend that waswith me said it was a tennis skirt butit says running but I guess you could doeither/orI loved it because it had these look atthese cute ruffles on the back and Ihave tried these little skirts beforeand they just haven't looked right notnot with the ruffles on the back butjust little running skirts tennis skirtsand they just have I don't know theyjust haven't really looked good but whenI tried this one on oh my gosh it was soadorable I could just wear this everysingle day in fact I really kind of wantto go back and see if they have any morecolors I went to the desert again thispast weekend for just a day with myhusband and I had mentioned stopping atthe outlet mall on the way home and hewas like what you want to do that andsaid well I want to go get some more ofthose little skirts and he said no andsince he was driving he kept going alsoone other thing that I found when I wasat Lululemon I didn't even think aboutthis but my friend Dana who was therewith me so she likes to buy the just theregular clothes there and I don'tnormally buy the regular clothes I justbuy workout clothes so I was kind ofinspired by her to look at the regularclothes section and wouldn't you know itI found something absolutely adorable asusual why wouldn't II can find something anywhere but Ifound this adorable cardigan and I gotit in I got it in a large a medium largebecause I love things to be loose andbaggy but look how cute it is it's kindof hard to tell how it looks in thescreen but let's see let's see what wecan do but is that not the cutestcardigan and it buttons here you canopeneror closed and it's got this right hereis a drawstring that's adjustableso you can tighten it up and give itmore of a cinched in look or you canwear it loose depending on the styleyou're looking for but this is adorableI love the it's kind of not a heathergray but more the Heather khaki this isthat makes sense or grayish khakineither khaki heather oliveanyways like a brownish greenish mixedwith grey but I thought it was adorableand I have been wearing this I've wornthat several times since I bought it andthen I found this oh my gosh I love thissweater this one I actually bought itbecause it was on the sale rack and evenon sale it was like 89 or $99 which tome is not really a sale but anyway Istill bought it because I loved it but Ilove that it's really versatile it'sthis cream color and oh it's got the thesleeves you know with the holes in it soyou can put your thumbs through there Ilove that but this is what caught my eyein the back isn't this cute it's kind ofa Oh what would you call this kind of afishnet II style but it opens so you canput a cute little tank top on underneaththe back I suggest you do wear a tanktop underneath I don't think just a braitself would look really good I don'tlike I personally don't like to seeexposed bra straps under like regularclothes I don't mind like I've got it ontoday well you can't even see it unlessI take this jacket off but um I don'tlike seeing them under regular clothesthat's just my style but you can alsoclose it up here there's a button downhere at the bottom so you can close itup so that you're not like flapping inthe wind but I just loved this sweater Ithought it was really cute and I thoughtit was very versatile and this will Imean I could wear this spring you boughtthis little sweatshirt that I've got on- it's just a basic little blacksweatshirt it's a hoodie so you can putthe hood up it's got the thumb holeslove it it's kind of um you know kind offitted oh look it comes complete with astain and of course you go out the backin classbut anyway about this too because Ithought well gosh you can always use ablack hoodie so now that I've shown youthis hoodie I think I'm gonna have totake it off because I'm actually gettinga little warm now but yeah as you cansee I'm having a super casual day I'mdressed and and workout clothes becauseI kind of feel like if I go ahead andwake up and get dressed and workoutclothes then I may be inspired toactually work out at some point duringthe day just just putting it out thereit may or may not happen I usually doget out and walk the dog and dependingon the the walk the extent of the walkwill depend on the extent of my workoutso I've been trying to drink a lot morewater latelylook this is another cool thing I boughtbeing a true southern girl at heart hereI have my mason jar full of water butthen I found these cool little tops atTargetthey're like little I don't you justsperm on and you put this on while I waswaiting for Dana to get to the outletmall I ran into xpress I haven't beeninto an Express in a while they do havea lot of really cute things there andthey had these dresses they were on saleif the things were on clearance I wantto say there was an extra 60 or 70% offthat price so when I found this dress itwas marked to $39.99 and I want to sayit was 60 or 70 percent of that so thisdress was practically free I just lovethe color it's like a nice coral colorI'm sure that it was on sale becausenumber one it was the outlet mall andnumber two just kind of indices in sincecorals are really popular in the summerbut this is just a real classic littlebutton-down shirt dress really prettywith the sash tie I love itI found another one I don't have itright here but it is pretty much exactlythe same thing but it is sleeveless andthat one oh my gosh almost like $14.99so that one they practically gave thatone to me so I figured that these wouldbe nice little basic dresses you candress them up dress them downwith a pair of sandals you put a pair ofheels with them you can wear leggingswith them those are just nice littledresses just to always have in yourwardrobewhile I was at Express I was gettingready to check out and of course nextdid the check out they have all thejewelry and the sunglasses on display soI sort of looking at the sunglasses Icouldn't resist I picked these up therewere $10 they're cheap II littlesunglasses but I just thought for anextra little pair that you could justlike throw in your bag and you justdon't care about I thought they'd be areally good thing for that so I boughtthese and I think they're cute I thinkthey look just as cute as any of my TomFord's so I might just keep these out atthe house in Palm Springs just to haveas an extra pair or just keep themaround or wear them to the beach becauseyou know you don't want to wear yourgood sunglasses to the beach but for tenbucks you can't beat that and the styleis like you know the style right now soon trend I guess that's what you wouldcall it on trend but I got those oh andthen I found these cute earrings I lovethese earrings because look how theykind of go through your ear and theyjust kind of hang there and I thinkthey're kind of a nice hoop alternativebecause for me when I put the big hoopsin you know the lot of times they turnbecause the way my ears are shaped theygo straight out so it looks just weirdbut these the way they hang the way theythe way they are shapedhang just a little I stopped into thecosmetics outlet I can't remember ifit's called the CCO or what it's calledbut they have a lot of Mac they have alot of Bobby Brown they have a lot ofEstee Lauder and they have those itlooks like they have the closeouts froma lot of the gifts or the gifts withpurchases that you can get from thedepartment stores well I just went in tolook just on a whim and I found a couplethings I don't need any more makeup mynext step is to clear out some of themakeup in my drawers just to make roomfor all the makeup that I have onnew stuff because my makeup collectionis just overflowing right now and I knowI look at it every single day and say Ineed every single thing in there but Ireally don't but this is something thatI did get it Mac Sunnyside mineralizedskinfinish it says natural I don't knowwhat that means if it just means it's anatural color but I love it becauseyou've got all these colors you can weareach one individually or you can swirlthem and it just kind of helps brightenup your face I have this on today I alsoput a different blush on but um but itkind of does brighten up your skin kindof gives you a really nice finish and Ijust thought that I would get some useout of this and I tend to be a littlemore yellowy so that I will say I'mopening up again is why I really kind ofgravitated toward this one with theyellow in it there was another one Iwant to say I had more Pink's in it butI chose the sunny side so hopefully thiswill get some good use and wolff haveproved to me that it was a good purchasejust a an impulse buy which it kind ofwas - and then I saw this color oflipstick it's Bobby Brown and this is Iwant to say it's called brown shimmerand I this you know on the display itjust really caught my attention Ithought it looked really really prettyand it's just kind of a sheer Brown withsome shimmer in it and can you see thatI thought this would just be a reallynice kind of a neutral color just kindof for one of those days that you mightnot have a whole lot of makeup on butyou just want to give your lips a littlepop nothing too fabulous but I pickedthat up and thought that I would getsome use out of that as well I thinkthat concludes my album all shopping Iran out of time we had to get to thehouse so we could start relaxing beforeI had Palm Springs weekend I had grosslunch with another friend of mine wholives a couple houses down our husbandsor we joke we we say they're in abromance tothey do everything together they'reobsessed with surfing so when they gooff surfing we're left behind and acouple weeks ago we decided we weregoing to go to lunch so we went to thisdelicious dim sum restaurants in SouthCoast Plaza and while we're waiting forour name to be called because we gotthere right at lunch there was a littlebit of a wait may take your cell phonenumber and they paid you when yourtables ready we decided to go kill sometime over at Victoria Secret andVictoria's Secret was having a reallybig sale on their vsx workout wear whichI kind of think I like the vsx workoutpants better than the Lululemon's I havea pair that I've been wearing a lot Idid not bring them to show you in thishall because they're basically just ahigh-waisted workout pants I mean whatis there to show you they're black theonly thing different about them as theysay v as X on it which I think standsfor Victoria's Secret exercise so yeahso I didn't bring those to show you inthis particular video but you canimagine what they look like they're justblack but they're very nice orcomfortable they stick you in in all theright places and especially you know ifyou're like me you have a little bit ofextra cushion right here around thewaist which I'm still very upset aboutthat I did not collect that cushionuntil I had my kids and I blame it onthe kids but then as I talked to more ofmy friends who are about my age and kindof you know becoming menopausal or goingthrough menopause or have already gonethrough it seems to be a fairly commonarea to gain a couple of pounds so Iguess I can't blame my kids for thatanymore if you wear those workout pantsthat pull all the way up then just suckyou in it just makes you feel better andmakes you want to work out more so Ifeel like that's a good beginning to agood workout but I did find this cutelittle sweatshirt actually my friendfound the sweatshirt and I grabbed itout of her hands about it but she wasokay she was okay with it but it'sreally cute it's kind of that Flashdancestyle that's cut off the shoulderslong-sleeved and it's got that pocket inthe front so you can stick yourcellphone or whatever in it or yourhands you put your hands in there if youum get cold while you're out working outbut I thought it was really cute kind ofthis aqua teal ish color and the salethat was going on with the workout pantsit was buy one pair of workout pants andone sports bra for $50so for $25 at peace that is a great dealbecause some of those workout pants ifyou just buy them on their own in theirnovice AO they're like 69 $70 and theworkout bras are up to $35 or the whatdo you call sports bras so I bought thepants and then I picked out this sportsbra which this is really seriously thisis an over the shoulder Boulder holderbut I loved it it's not right there it'sgot your vsx on the back but it it willgive you I think it's gonna give reallygood support I've worn it once alreadybut it's gotten it's got the paddingright there I like these because theycome in different sizes I wear a 36d inthe bra area so you can actually getyour bra size which is kind of niceI will not wear these just by themselvesyou know a lot of these girls do I willwear this probably with a black tank topand I'll wear it so that you have just ahint of the pink sticking out and ofcourse so that the tee back kind ofsticks out you know that's why they dothis right so that you'll expose thatarea but I thought it was a really goodprice so if you're gonna go in and buythe workout gear try to wait for a salelike that because otherwise you're gonnabe paying a lot more for the pants andyou're gonna be paying that much for thepants you might as well pay a littlemore and get the Lululemon because weall know those fit really nice but for$25 I almost wish I'd bought more but Ihave so many right now so many workoutpants I figured that I better just waitand I'm sure that sale will come backthey always doand then I have been watching videos andthis one has come up the Cody airspunpowder I haven't seen this powder inyears and years and years and years anddecided that I wanted to give it anothershot and I found it at Walmart whichright there I never go to Walmart sothat's always a fun experience but itreminds me of back when I was a teenagerwhen you first start wearing makeup thisis like one of the powders that wasreally popular back then for me I thinkit's been popular ever since probablyour grandmothers started wearing makeupway back whenI'm sure the formula is changed a littlebit but it sure doessmell the same as it did when I was ateenager so just smelling this broughtback some nice memories and then ofcourse it's got this to you a littlepowder puff I put this on this morning Idid it over no not over my makeup I didit under my makeup I was using the WayneGoss method to use it as a primerunderneath my liquid foundation and it'sokay it's not um fabulous but I don'tknow I'm gonna try it a few more timesI'll let you know if I still like itthis is the naturally neutral and I didnot use the powder puff to apply it Idid use a brush maybe I should just usethe powder puff I bet you could justreally get it in there really good intothose pores but yeah so naturallyneutral Cody airspun just kind of a funlittle reminiscent flashback productthat I decided I wanted to try again andrecently I was asked to try this vitaminC serumit's from exponential Beauty this is anew company you can purchase this onAmazon I've been looking for a vitamin Cserum that I've been wanting to try Ikind of feel like my hyperpigmentationis coming back I haven't really had timeto do a peel I just don't have time topeel you know I work a lot it set wellactually no I don't really work a lotbut seems like every time I have time todo a peel I'm getting ready to go towork and I just can't be flaking when Igo to work so I need to have a vacationvacation to have time to do a feel so Iadded thisinto my routine along with my retin-aand my Obagi so let's see how this worksI was asked to do a

yourself ifyou're looking for a new vitamin C serumso far I'm really liking I've noticed mypink manicure I am wearing pink becauseit is October and October is NationalBreast Cancer Awareness Month so Idecided to do my nails pink in fact Ithink I'll do different shades of pinkall month I actually think that theBreast Cancer Awareness pink is maybe alittle lighter than this but we're gonnastart with this if you're wondering whatthe color is it is China Glaze and it iscalled sexy lady I've had it for everand everbut it is a really pretty color and youwill see different shades of pink thismonth if I make it back to do anothervideo it's about yeah I'm trying tothink if I've done anything too excitingthe past few weeks oh we went to thatair showI absolutely love going to the air showto watch the Blue Angels we took alittle trip down to San Diego to MiramarAir Force Base is it oh no it's not AirForce Base Marine base Miramar Marinebase and watched the air show therewatch the Blue Angels do all theirtricks and oh it's just I love I lovewatching the planes I just absolutelylove watching the planes I don't knowwhy I think it's because I was amilitary child my dad was in the AirForce and going on to military basesjust really brings my childhood back andI think that I just always feel a littlea little nostalgic when I go to the tothe air shows and then of course we madethe mistake of taking my son who nowwould like to have a fighter jets soyeah hope you told him how he could getone and that would be by joining themilitary becoming a pilot'sotherwise yeah Santa does not bringfighter jets for Christmas I say thatwas pretty much the most exciting thingwe've done lately other than I'm justhanging out the weather's been sobeautiful around here we just kind ofwant to hang out and go to the beach andwhy not we lived right here takeadvantage what we can winter will behere soon and we're not gonna have thesepretty days so that's what we've beendoing I hope everyone's having a greatfall and

ofgravitated toward this one with theyellow in it there was another one Iwant to say I had more Pink's in it butI chose the sunny side so hopefully thiswill get some good use and wolff haveproved to me that it was a good purchasejust a an impulse buy which it kind ofwas - and then I saw this color oflipstick it's Bobby Brown and this is Iwant to say it's called brown shimmerand I this you know on the display itjust really caught my attention Ithought it looked really really prettyand it's just kind of a sheer Brown withsome shimmer in it and can you see thatI thought this would just be a reallynice kind of a neutral color just kindof for one of those days that you mightnot have a whole lot of makeup on butyou just want to give your lips a littlepop nothing too fabulous but I pickedthat up and thought that I would getsome use out of that as well I thinkthat concludes my album all shopping Iran out of time we had to get to thehouse so we could start relaxing beforeI had Palm Springs weekend I had grosslunch with another friend of mine wholives a couple houses down our husbandsor we joke we we say they're in abromance tothey do everything together they'reobsessed with surfing so when they gooff surfing we're left behind and acouple weeks ago we decided we weregoing to go to lunch so we went to thisdelicious dim sum restaurants in SouthCoast Plaza and while we're waiting forour name to be called because we gotthere right at lunch there was a littlebit of a wait may take your cell phonenumber and they paid you when yourtables ready we decided to go kill sometime over at Victoria Secret andVictoria's Secret was having a reallybig sale on their vsx workout wear whichI kind of think I like the vsx workoutpants better than the Lululemon's I havea pair that I've been wearing a lot Idid not bring them to show you in thishall because they're basically just ahigh-waisted workout pants I mean whatis there to show you they're black theonly thing different about them as theysay v as X on it which I think standsfor Victoria's Secret exercise so yeahso I didn't bring those to show you inthis particular video but you canimagine what they look like they're justblack but they're very nice orcomfortable they stick you in in all theright places and especially you know ifyou're like me you have a little bit ofextra cushion right here around thewaist which I'm still very upset aboutthat I did not collect that cushionuntil I had my kids and I blame it onthe kids but then as I talked to more ofmy friends who are about my age and kindof you know becoming menopausal or goingthrough menopause or have already gonethrough it seems to be a fairly commonarea to gain a couple of pounds so Iguess I can't blame my kids for thatanymore if you wear those workout pantsthat pull all the way up then just suckyou in it just makes you feel better andmakes you want to work out more so Ifeel like that's a good beginning to agood workout but I did find this cutelittle sweatshirt actually my friendfound the sweatshirt and I grabbed itout of her hands about it but she wasokay she was okay with it but it'sreally cute it's kind of that Flashdancestyle that's cut off the shoulderslong-sleeved and it's got that pocket inthe front so you can stick yourcellphone or whatever in it or yourhands you put your hands in there if youum get cold while you're out working outbut I thought it was really cute kind ofthis aqua teal ish color and the salethat was going on with the workout pantsit was buy one pair of workout pants andone sports bra for $50so for $25 at peace that is a great dealbecause some of those workout pants ifyou just buy them on their own in theirnovice AO they're like 69 $70 and theworkout bras are up to $35 or the whatdo you call sports bras so I bought thepants and then I picked out this sportsbra which this is really seriously thisis an over the shoulder Boulder holderbut I loved it it's not right there it'sgot your vsx on the back but it it willgive you I think it's gonna give reallygood support I've worn it once alreadybut it's gotten it's got the paddingright there I like these because theycome in different sizes I wear a 36d inthe bra area so you can actually getyour bra size which is kind of niceI will not wear these just by themselvesyou know a lot of these girls do I willwear this probably with a black tank topand I'll wear it so that you have just ahint of the pink sticking out and ofcourse so that the tee back kind ofsticks out you know that's why they dothis right so that you'll expose thatarea but I thought it was a really goodprice so if you're gonna go in and buythe workout gear try to wait for a salelike that because otherwise you're gonnabe paying a lot more for the pants andyou're gonna be paying that much for thepants you might as well pay a littlemore and get the Lululemon because weall know those fit really nice but for$25 I almost wish I'd bought more but Ihave so many right now so many workoutpants I figured that I better just waitand I'm sure that sale will come backthey always doand then I have been watching videos andthis one has come up the Cody airspunpowder I haven't seen this powder inyears and years and years and years anddecided that I wanted to give it anothershot and I found it at Walmart whichright there I never go to Walmart sothat's always a fun experience but itreminds me of back when I was a teenagerwhen you first start wearing makeup thisis like one of the powders that wasreally popular back then for me I thinkit's been popular ever since probablyour grandmothers started wearing makeupway back whenI'm sure the formula is changed a littlebit but it sure doessmell the same as it did when I was ateenager so just smelling this broughtback some nice memories and then ofcourse it's got this to you a littlepowder puff I put this on this morning Idid it over no not over my makeup I didit under my makeup I was using the WayneGoss method to use it as a primerunderneath my liquid foundation and it'sokay it's not um fabulous but I don'tknow I'm gonna try it a few more timesI'll let you know if I still like itthis is the naturally neutral and I didnot use the powder puff to apply it Idid use a brush maybe I should just usethe powder puff I bet you could justreally get it in there really good intothose pores but yeah so naturallyneutral Cody airspun just kind of a funlittle reminiscent flashback productthat I decided I wanted to try again andrecently I was asked to try this vitaminC serumit's from exponential Beauty this is anew company

my son who nowwould like to have a fighter jets soyeah hope you told him how he could getone and that would be by joining themilitary becoming a pilot'sotherwise yeah Santa does not bringfighter jets

the friends people asked me if I coulddo a gym hall or like a clothing halland I thought why not I have some of mykind of like go-to activewear stuff -gym clothes and I thought I would justshow you guys it and give you my opinionon it so if you are interested in thatthen here you gofavorite sports bra that I pretty muchwear every single day is this guy righthere it is from forever 21 and it is asize medium and this kind of reminds meof the knockoff version of the reallyexpensive Lululemon bras that I justcan't get myself to five years branumber two wins for overall cutenessbecause it has a little see-through kindof pockets right here I just thinkthat's really adorable and again supercheap this guy I think was twelvedollars it has the boob pads in it aswell and as well as a size medium sportsbra number three I've not worn this tothe gym but it's just kind of like areally cute sports bra searchingeverywhere for this kind of sports braand I finally found it at forever 21 itis the one with the kind of like stringyback to it and the only thing that Iwould say is kind of sucky on this isthat these straps aren't adjustable verycute if you match it with a open backshirt or something like that and I thinkthis was like 19 dollars but still a lotbetter price than the brand email onesthat are like $60 this is shirt that ipair it with it is just an open backshirt as you can see it's kind of alittle bit see-through I guess can yousee me through this the only bad thingabout this again is that it does kind offall off your shoulders a bit but itlooks cute so I got to do what you gotto do I got this from forever 21 and itwas $9 $9.50 you're just like my go-toones I really like how high theycome up and I take a small in these onesand they fit me perfectly I'm startingto realize that this is pretty much likeall forever21 stuff but top number twois just a plain gray workout top it kindof reminds me of a knock off of theLululemon ones because I've kind ofliked the patter this as well is a sizemedium and it has a already built insports bra for you boob pads all thatgood stuffthis was $19 now here is a realLululemon shirt this is I'm not gonnaknow what these are called because Idon't know the names of them all but I'mpretty sure these are the ones that likeNicki black better got because then Isaw them in her vlog I'm just like oh mygod I need themI really like how the back is open andhas like that mesh right there becauseit's really breathable but I never wearthis because this is my problem with gettoo small of a size to kind of fit mychest so that it's not baggy up here itdoesn't fit my back and then if I getsomething that fits my back it doesn'tfit my chest and it's like really saggyand I'm just gonna have a nip slip atthe gym so and now for leggings my go-toleggings that I wear like every singleday of my life are the align pant I havethe black ones and then I have themaroon colored ones anything is I've hadthese probably for around three monthsI'm gonna say and unfortunately theirquality of them are just not too greatand take care of these so well I handwash them I never put them in the dryeronce and yeah they just like I thinkit's called pilling but yeah they pilland there's little balls all over themso hundred dollars I don't know it's alot of money to spend on pants now myoriginal favorite Lululemon's I've hadthese babies for like seven years arethe gross hair all over them are theWonder Underpants for hundred dollarsthis is good quality and no issuesthey're not see-throughI find that forever21 likings are alittle bit see-through but I have had noproblems with you wonder unders or eventhe aline panting seekers if i recommendunder Underpants I wonder unders as wellbut they're a little bit more excitingbecause they are bright pink or coraland drumroll pleasethey reversible they are freakinreversible so pink then you turn theminside out BAM gray I'm pretty sure thatNika has the same ones but she has blackand then they are reversible too I thinklike a teal green color so they're supercool too and yeah they make the bootylook fantastic and I love them have theNike running Leggett these are supercomfortable the material of these arejust like a dream come truehowever they are see-through I'm justwarning you I mean it's fine I mean Idon't really care that much if I'm justlike running in them but I never runpretty sure these were around $40 sothey're not as expensive as Lululemon'skeep that in mind and I guess you do getwhat you pay forhow did I forget these Lululemon onesthese are like my all-time faves oh mygod I say that for everything butseriously again wonder unders but B arethe gray ones they do wonders for butthey are amazing I've had these forprobably like five years they do nothave any frickin balls on them a lotsofter than the Wonder unders I guessit's like the luan in them I don't knowI don't work for a little man I don'tknow what I'm talking about right nowbut they're super super comfortable andI would highly recommend these becausethey are totally worth the money I tellyou guys what sighs I was in Lululemonbut I am a size four and they're leggingNike shorts these are like actuallysupposed to be the coral color eventhough it doesn't really look like itbut Nike Sportswear shorts I like thembecause they don't have that stupidliner and these are a size extra smallthey are super nice the waistband isnice and stretchy 19 bucks and anotherthing I forgot to try on are the Nikepros but the capri version yep I'm gonnabe honest I hate Nike pros I hate them Ihate them they give me the hugestcameltoe I'm sorryTMI but you were always just likepulling down they make my butt looksuper flat and them a little bitsee-through oh yeah you can see that youcan see my face right through them see Idon't know I don't think person use areworth the money because I mean I'm beingbiased because I just don't like howthey look on me so I'm kind of mad atthe world about that but I mean I guessif that's what you like then they'regood but not a fan of these guys righthere so yeah I think that is all I thinkI covered all the all the things that Iwanted to say forever21 is probably myfavorite out of all of them it's justaffordable nice clothes good qualityLululemon awesome I think more so forthe leggings I can't really justify itas spend like 40 50 bucks on like aworkout top or sports bra but theleggings are definitely worth it if youkeep care of them and then Nike hastheir good stuff has their bad stuff butso I hope you guys liked this kind ofvideo it was kind of all over the placeI'm not really good at these videosright yeah but yeah if you guys have anyquestions at all or if you want me to doa more in-depth review on some of thisstuff or even just do like favoritesvideo I don't know just tell me what youguys want and I shall make a video on itbut I hope you guys like this and I hopeyou got to see some of my cute littleworkout clothes and I will see you

alright this is my presentation for theUM the water containment unit projectfrom lululemon brand you can see hereI've got my 3d model and it's based offof the sketch here my beginning sketchesor I show that it would be worn like ona strap on your shoulder and I showedthat like it's completely deflatedversus I partially inflated and how itacts like a um like a water bladder kindof like a camel back but trying toincorporate their um their logo into thedesign and then I started working on theUM the volume measurements and umcalculations using an ellipse formulaand then sorry my camera was adjustingand then here I did an orthographic viewand I did some like simple color studiestrying to keep it minimal patterns Ithink would look good with multipletypes of clothing but also stand out onits own so I took my two favorite onesand I put them in the orthographic hereand I made this one like a reverse oftheir logo where their logo was red withthe white lion this one is white withthe red lion so just like a the line aslike a pop to it and that's the UM wherethe fabric changes and that would be theseam where they're sewn together and Ijust stuck to a simple clear cap thatcould pop off a little nozzle on the topso smaller than this cap that you seehere and it would be clear and so thenhere I have my final sketch for theproject I tried to incorporate somethings we'd already learned about inclass that I hadn't done before becauseI've never really worked with the whitemarker and um or with texture underneaththe the drawing I've done that like onceor twice but never really liked in toomuch detail so it was nice to try tolearn how tothat and a little bit texture to showthat it's fabric and them so that's myfinal design these are my final sketchesfor the project try to get them indetail for you and so that's all you'regonna be all right thank you,17,UCCzODDnIM4xdZxOLUGF7KSg,lululemon,16,81,0,222,"['lululemon', 'yoga', 'run', 'sweat', 'yoga benefits', 'yoga for athletes', 'yoga for sports', 'yoga for football', 'exercise', 'meditation', 'mindfulness', 'football', 'sports', 'Nick Foles', 'Super Bowl', 'recovery yoga', 'community']",lululemon | 3 Ways Yoga Benefits Athletes | Nick Foles,qNGNCtQF7eg,26694

literally like a full-bodyleg warmer pretty much um so you can seeup close the fabric is ribbed so itliterally like they really do feel likewild dance like warmers oh and the coolthing about these is they are a skinnyfit as you can see and hopefully when Ido the Tryon you can see it as wellthere are skinny fit but you canunbutton the legs if you want it to bemore like a flared sweat pant fit theyweren't baggy they fit well they'resuper soft so I already have a ton oflegfrom Loulou obviously you can never havetoo many but I was like yo I want to gosomething a little different today sothese are going to be good for like toin from the gym lounging around thehouse Christmas morning um all that goodstuff so the it's made with boo luxefabric a blend of cashmere tencel andrayon from bamboo so that's a freakingawesome and they are drawstrings so youcan adjust how tight they are so thosealready find your mantra pants if youfollowing out its again this is theshirt that I posted the sofiane you guysreally like this shirt so I willdefinitely try and show you on videowhat it looks like on this is the end goeverywhere tank um so it's just like agray heathered fabric it's really coolbecause it's kind of crisscross see inthe back when it's on you'll be able tosee that a little bit a little bitbetterthis must slightly fitted but not skintightum it is the luan the light blue onfabric for sweat wicking and four-waystretch and I love grey like I loveneutrals this literally all I bought acloset building tips when you buy allthe same colors everything matches youthink I'm kidding but everything happywas a really nice shirt that I got umand again I really like the kind ofheathered gray color again will keepingit in the same colored family this isthe restless hoodie so what I reallyliked about this first of all the printis really really neat and it looks supercool on but what I really liked aboutthis is I love hoodies but I don't and Ido want to get one of the Louvre hoodiesI tried one on today so I might ask forone for Christmas but what I really likeabout this is I don't always want tofeel like a marshmallow in terms ofhoodie wearing so that's why I do like alot of Lulu's jackets and things likethis and such because they are fittedand so you look a little bit morestreamlined a little bit more tailoredand that's what I personally like I dolike to look a little bit morestreamlined as opposed to a bumsometimes I like to look like a bum justdepends on the day fends on my boob butmore often than not I don't want to looklike a bum so this is a little bit morefitted it has some holes which is a bigfor me like I freaking love fumble it'sgot a hidden media pouch and cord guidein a kangaroo pocket to put your phone Ilove getting a root by I want tokangaroo I asked my mom to bring me backa kangaroo from Australia and she saidno and I was like that's really rudeshe wouldn't bring me a koala eitherwhatever oh yeah this is the restlesshoodie I do wear size fours in all Lulustuff some of the shirts I will saythough like the in the video that I didon the failure video that running in thecity tank I did have to get a six inthat shirt because it was really fittedin my lats specifically in some of thesports world I have to get sixes in aswell but as far as pants and the vastmajority of shirts and jackets andsweaters and everything like that arefor um so those are the sizing that isthe sizing info so yeah that is mylittle Lulu haul for today and I didstop in at forever 21 um just because Iwant I was looking for scarves and thenI've also been on the hunt for a grayturtleneck sweater so I I really liketurtlenecks like they're classic but Iwanted to fit fitted gray turtlenecksweater just cuz again it's a littlemore streamlined so this uh is theturtleneck that I got from forever 21this is a small and it was like 22dollars it's pretty soft like sometimesI find it Forever 21's fabrics are justnot comfortable and so I don't reallyshow up there a lot this one wasn'tscratchy at all it fit pretty well youcould see my delts through it which wasnice but yeah so this will be greatunder like a leather jacket or on or onits own you know whatever tucked intosome black jeans tucked into somehigh-waisted jeans all that good stuffand then this is a scarf that I got I'mfairly sure that Robin has this scarfwhich is ironic because like I saidbefore I'm obsessed with her and maybethis means were like spirituallyconnected now Robin Mollyalrighty I just really got a scarf so Icould hide in it but no just kiddingthis scarf is huge and majestic and Iwill not buy this car if it does notengulfed at least 60% of my upper bodyand that one passed the test so um thatis been my little Lulu and forever 21mini hole someone asked me to do like alookbook like a Lulu lookbook so maybeI'll do that in a future glowing thisvideo catch you guys on this day 12 istomorrowso that'll be that for today I love youguys so much thank you for

guys it's been a while since I've done ahalt I think it's been about a month andI've just been super busy so I figured Iwould combine the past two weeks thatI've done I'm of shopping and show youguys exactly what I've gotten my guessfor the full / winter season so I guesswe'll start with this forever 21necklace that I love it's like thisgreenish teal color and I love bigstatement necklaces and I love the onesthat they have at j.crew I just don'treally want to spend ninety dollars on anecklace so I found an alternative whichwas something like this and this wastwelve dollars and eighty cents and I'veworn it quite a few times i left thefact that it comes down like this kindof like chandelier um style i guess andi love the color of it and then I gotthis one then this one was think sevendollars you know when I first saw it Iwas like oh it's a little tacky but Ithink of you wear it with the rightthing it'll be really cute so these arethe two things that I got from forever21 I also went to macy's and i love themacy's at the beverly center if you goduring their one-day sales you cantotally totally find a bunch of reallycute stuff for very cheap one of myfavorite brands is free people and halfmy closet is free people in every time Igo to their one-day sale at Macy's inBeverly Center I seriously find the bestthings I got this really cute tunicstyle top I'm sure it could be addressedin the summer it's free people and i gotit for i think it was around $14 and theoriginal price was 58 so i thought thatwas the steel and when it gets cold Icamera it with leggings and some bootsand a cute little jacket and then I gotthis one some of these don't have tagsbecause I've already warned them and Igot this free people top i love the factthat it kinda has a little ruffle in theback and I like the mesh detailing ofthis makes it see-through so it showsjust a little bit of skin and I got thisfor sixteen dollars and I think itoriginally was like saidd or something like that nein I got thisreally cute dress I love all theirdresses so this is the dress it looks alittle short but it's not that bad iguess this is the back and this dress igot for $28 from 120 or something and ilove it i love the ombre the fact thatit changes colors and i'll definitelyworried about actually already worn itworked with boots and it looked reallycute and i needed jeans really bad iwear jeans all the time so I found thesereally cute citizens of humanity jeansyour straight leg and I got these for$65 from 200 bucks which I guess wouldsay is a really good deal I love theseuses the only thing is that for somereason all of the citizens of humanityjeans that i purchased seem to get baggyafter a while and that's the onlyproblem i would say i have with thisJean I've also had a different one bycitizens of humanity and it just getssaggy and loose under the legs in thebutt area and after a while I don't feelvery cute way them but once you washthem and take him out of the dryer andstaff they seem to kind of shrink upback to the original I guess sighs thenI got these cute purple shorts by joejoe's jeans um they were on sale for 25bucks from 128 and i thought that eventhough it might start to get cold ithink they'll be really cute in thesummer and i live in santa barbara soit's usually always decent enough towear shorts except when it rains so ithought that was a really good deal andi got these really cute white white Joegenes and their crop a very simplepocket and ya got these for 35 bucks andobviously they're on sale becausethey're white because white is I guess asummer thing butwear them anyways regardless of theirwhite or black and I got this other freepeople top let me figure it out okay sothis is the front and it's as the backit kind of has this really cute not thisI got for 13 bucks or something likethat and I just think it's so cute withlike a little lace bandeau because it'skind of low on the side it will show thelease and I think it's cute that it'skind of loose so I'll wear it with askinny jean or a short or something alittle bit more fitted I think that'sall for Macy's so yeah I got all thatstuff and it was I got under 150 bucksso I was very excited for that Marshallsis the second so I went to I went to theone here in Santa Barbara like I saidit's from the past two weeks combined soI like Marshalls because they have a lotof cute stuff I got these AG jeansthey're skinny yeah the like they'reskinny skinny jean and this is my firstpair of AG jeans I usually wear sevenjeans or Frankie be you know Frankie behigh school jeans I love those but i gotthese AG jeans for thirty nine ninetynine forty bucks and they're actuallyprobably my top three favorite Jean justbecause the way they fit they don'tloosen up there really flattering in thebutt area and the legs and I love themwith boots because I think skinny jeansare perfect with boobs & anything likethat and they'll be really cute with abig oversized sweater mean I said freepeople I got this really cute likemilitary jacket from free people atmarshalls it was $25 and it's so cuteit's warm thick it has this black liningin the inside but it's actually prettywarm and I think it'll be cute for dressas I wore it with jeans and bootsbecause it was cold recently one day itwas probably cold because it's alwayswarm here so yeah so that's when I gotfrom marshalls and Macy's um I think Iwould say my favorite favorite thingthat I purchased in the past two weekshas to be these products on glasses iusually don't spend that much money onsunglasses just because i usually breaktheor we use them or somebody steps on themwhen i leave them in my car so I gotthese amazing Protestant glasses thestyle is called baroque and they'rereally cute an aside has this reallypretty swirl and they're my favoritefavorite favorite favorite sunglasses Igot kind of like this pinky I guess toneI guess that's what it that was adescription like this paint chalon thelens is kind of pink and um they come ina black they come in like I guess like acheetah print I don't know I guess I wasa cheetah print but um they also come ina blue and a few other colors I thinkthese are the four colors actually theycome in and i already have blacksunglasses and i already have with thischeetah print I think it's called HavanaI don't know I might be making up butand those are the two that I alreadyhave color wise so I was like oh I needto get something different so I gotthese and you can find these atNordstrom's unify them on sax online andthey were 290 and like I said that's thelaw I don't usually spend that much onone thing cuz that's like almost my oneof my monthly car payment so I was justlike you know what I need to get thembecause I've wanted them for a long timeand if you google prada broke spelledbeet AR o qu e you'll get a ton ofdifferent links if you're interested ingetting something like that and i thinkthey have a few other really cool styleswith the swirls and you'll definitelylove them I've had him for a few daysand I just like we want to wear themeven when I go inside places so yeah sothat was my favorite purchase within thepast two weeks I still have a few otherthings I have to show you guys let megrab them this actually isn't the pasttwo weeks this is probably like a montha half ago but these tory burch flatssorry it keeps getting dark these toryburch flats i would say are the bestflats i have ever ever ever purchasedand tried on and worn and i love themthey come in this color in a nude and igot the black first because i don't haveblock but i love the fact that it hasthe stretchy thing right hereand it makes it that much morecomfortable and these were 225 225 atnordstroms in it's a really goodinvestment I mean 225 really go i canbuy a ton of other stuff with that but ithink this is one of the bestinvestments that I have made shoe wisejust because you can just fold themstick them in your purse you know throwthem on in I think they're sosophisticated and easy that you canthrow them on with what I'm learningright now or you can wear them with adress or skinny jeans or tights I don'tknow I love them and I would definitelyrecommend them for anyone that's lookingfor the perfect flat okay so you know Iused to shop at Abercrombie all the timewhen I was in high school or elementaryschool and literally my closet wasAbercrombie because it was like thecoolest place to go to and I haven'tbeen there in a long long time justbecause it's not really my style I guessanymore but I found a few things onlinethat I thought I could potentially wheremake look cute for example this littlefrilly skirt it's a little young but Iam young um I thought it would be cutewith a white tank top and a cute jeanjacket and flats or sandals and it wasonly eleven dollars or something reallyan expensive like that so I figured Icouldn't go wrong and it fits it's onyour hips are you like a higher wastedit would be adorable so I got that Ihaven't worn it yet and then I got thisreally cute quartz a corset top and youcan tie this make it into a bow and Ithink it would be really cute with thegene oh my bows a little crappy but youget the idea and this was like twelveninety something so those are the twothings that i got from abercrombie theone thing that i haven't stopped gettingfrom a burr homie are their tank tops Idon't buy them full price because 25bucks or however much they cost for atank top to me is ridiculous so I got Ithink too they're lost somewhereprobably in my laundry I gotand then I got a white a white for sureand they were like seven bucks orsomething and I just like the way thatthey fit not the racerback ones just thenormal ones because I can wear my brawith it without having to worry aboutshowing my bra so yeah those are theother two things that i got fromabercrombie and then we're gonna move onto some awesome shoes by jeffreycampbell i always loved their boxes tojeffrey campbell design on their boxexhaustion I believe these actually Idon't need anything but I love to shopand I'm a girl so you know how it is soI got these really cute wedges byjeffrey campbell they are adorable ihave yet to wear them they're one of mymost recent purchases and they have aplatform so that really helps to walk inthem so they're not really that high toput like three inches high if you wereto talk without the platform and i gotthese on sale for 87 or somethingdollars online and i love them and theyhave them in a different color but ithink they're sold out now because theywere just so inexpensive well I mean 80bucks is kind of a long but for JeffreyCampbell you can't go wrong and I thinkthese will be adorable adorable with anoversized sweater like this and a scarfand just a cute little crossbody bag sothat is my recent jeffrey campbellpurchase i've heard a lot of good thingsabout his wedges they're not toohorrible to walk in because i buy a lotof heels and wedges and stuff and Ihonestly wear them for like two hoursand I'm done like the ChristianLouboutins that i purchased a few monthsago like half a year ago or whatever ilove them but i can only wear them forlike hour and a half men my feet aredone and you're going to spend fivehundred dollars on a pair of shoes youwant to make sure you're actually youknow where them so i try to wear them asoften as i can but it's kind ofdifficult to think about spending thatmuch money on a shoe that you're reallynot going to worry about much so that'swhy the tory burch flats I think that'sdefinitely a great investment so whereis it hereís so I've heard a lot of goodthings about lululemon i actually haveneverpurchase anything from there untilrecently one of my best friends has likeLululemon workout pants like that's allshe wears I think I gotta give these agoI know the price is a little steep it'slike $72 for these they're just likesome cubot crops and I actually have tosay that they are the best material whenit comes to yoga / workout pants andshorts and tops and whatnot I didn'twant to spend the 72 dollars on thembecause that's a lot of money for a pairof workout pants but I did it and I'veworn them two or three times so far andi have to say they are amazing and i'mgonna go back and get the full lengtheventually so yeah these are the croppants and they're really cute they havethis pocket that um i guess is for yourcredit card and your keys and it's deepin there so it doesn't get lost but ihaven't put anything in there yet so sothat is my lululemon purchased and lastbut not least i got these page thesepaige jeans that have um so you can'treally I don't know you can see theshininess but it kind of has this waxymaterial and I've wanted leather pantsfor a really long time but I can't findany without having them be 500 bucksyeah you can see the shininess so it'slike a it's like a wax coated denim andI love them I haven't worn them yet andhang out these that makes his own aswell these were on sale you're like 160something and I have never owned a pairof paige jeans so the AG jeans and thesepaige jeans are my first time owningthis brand when it comes to jeans sowe'll see how it goes and excited towear these and then i said last but notleast but there's one more thing ididn't purchase it one of my bestfriend's got them for me because she'sjust awesome i have worn through all myclothes there I've worn um converse youknow Chuck's Chuck Taylors for a longtime but I've never had high tops and Iwanted to tell me I didn't want to getthem so my best friend let me see if youcan see themshe got these for me just the white yeahthere we go just the white and I lovethem so far it's like a got like I was alittle kid playing on the jungle jumpdoing that but yeah I've worn them withmy Lululemon's when I went to theuniversal studios horror night southerneight and i love them i usually don'twear tennis shoes and I think these weperfect to throw them on with skirts anddresses even though I know a lot ofpeople don't like tennis shoes withdresses and skirts and cute jeans etcbut I think they'll be Q and I like themso I can't wait to wear them why I'mwearing them right now but you know whatI mean

going to say I'mso awkward so hopefully you guys don'tnotice it too much although if there's amillion edits it that's what happened Iliterally forget my train of thought inmid-sentence and rambling for 2 minutesand 42 secondsright now I'm just wearing a like a thisis my like confident casual clothes Iguess yeah and shorts and I'm justprobably going to start editing a blogfirst I have to purge my computer of allthe videos that are on it because itslows down and crashes like every time Itry to edit a blog and yeah so I'm goingto do that we have our external harddriveswe're going to get to editing days twothree four five six or seven so yeah alittle bit behind but I'm going tocombine a combine a few them it probablyyes definitely me did a little bitbetter with my editing staying on trackand like probably should do a little bitof it every dayI'm going to shut up now it's now beenfour minutes me rambling so we'llprobably have to cut this tooI'll show you the next thing I do that'sso Jeff has this really really annoyingtrait problem not sure to call it wherehe just does not finish the rest ofsomething like he when we buy a new millfor example he'll leave a little bit inthe bottom it is so annoying because itwill go bad and then I will just sit inour fridge and I'm the one who has tothrow it out or use the bottoms of itbut literally with everything likeeverything they are you cereal crackersanything help always leave the bottom ofit I don't know why it's reallyfrustrating game and a scratch this ismy really bad habit of it I don't putthe color aza mills or anything I justleave the cover off right there and Inever put this stuff away I'm sorry howgood does that lookreduce infection in a house pickle Idon't know if you guys got a chance tocheck that out but it's just basicallythey don't have feel very often my guesthome two years or halfway sale where andthey kind of clear their warehouse ofall the things I didn't sell as well andI test the lights on that so I gotsomething this is the first time openingthis package so there's a live openingand I ordered this stuff with fall inmind because it's coming up pretty fasthapana so first off I got myself thisjacket so I don't really have a lot ofjust casual jackets and this one's kindof good because it is tribal but it'skind of still a little dressy at thesame time so I should be able to wearwith a few things and if it doesn't itwouldn't even look bad since its LuluI'm in its athletic wear wouldn't lookbad probably with gym clothes eitherwhich is probably let's be honest whatI'm going to be wearing this with soit's a little looser but oh it's niceit's like a little bit what is that likea trench coat so therefore they have theframe I don't know what thenofficial means behaviour thing just helpserene people so I don't think it'sactually meant for rainy weather butwhat it looks like it's for anything sodoesn't say what I pay for it but I knowI got it at a discounted price think Iprobably paid like it was worth 140 orsomething and I paid like $70 for itit's got two pocketsand that's going to be really cute forthe end of summer and going into falland really got it next on this tapas isone in two by the way personally like toinvest my money in pieces that are goingto last a very long time and a lot of mylemon stuff is like two years old or ayear old or whatever I held on to it fora long time so this is another kind offall piece it's a late summer it's alittle cropped hoodie so I am all aboutthat cropped place it's not like I knowthat all of this is really new it and inrecently especially in the fitnesscommunity but I've always had a veryvery short torso and my hips are reallyhigh so crop stuff just goes on my bodya lot better anything longer kind ofjust boxes over my waist and just makesme look like look like in a bigger leaseso with the prop stuff you can kind ofsee you like that this is how it looksagain it's a bit looser but it's crop soit can still see the wayI really love this color with the purpleshorts - it's good and it's kind of likea stretchy material here and then asweater material here this is like theribbed and it's got the little thumbholes which I love really that's all Igot so that's my little one off in orderanything office when I ordered it I trynot to over indulge and save a bit ofmoney I'm trying to see plenty now

welcome my name is Carolyn and virtualI'm a Lululemon ambassador and I teachmeditation and yoga for everyone in thismeditation we will explore ourmindfulness and specifically mindfulbreathing there's a common misconceptionthat when you sit down to meditate youmust stop all of your thoughts rather wewill explore meditation as anopportunity to focus the mind on morehelpful thoughts and more aware thoughtsso grab your cushion or a block find acomfortable way to sit close your eyesand let's dive inbecome aware of your breathingwhen we take time out from our day tosit in meditation or just find time topause it's important that we askourselves how we're feeling in order tobe aware of what we're bringing into themeditation so conduct a little scan fromyour head down to your toes notice allthe things that you're feeling right nownotice if your thoughts are busy noticeif maybe you already feel alertjust take in all the things that aregoing on for you right nowand the more conscious we become of whatwe're experiencing the more mindful wereally arein many different Buddhist schools ofmeditation or lineages mindfulness ispracticed when we sit down to meditateand there are many things that we can bemindful about we can repeat a mantrainternally we can sense for all thesounds around uswe can focus our eyes on the flame of acandle in front of us we can be mindfulof visualizations in our minds but inall Buddhist traditions the most commonform of mindfulness is breath yourbreath is the tool that you always havewith you that you can focus onjust let your inhale merge with yourexhale and allow your exhale to mergewith your inhale so your breathing isnever forced and always very relaxingsoften and your low abdomen so you'rekind of breathing how an infant wouldbreathe these low belly breathsrest your inner gaze into your spinalcolumn your spine is the central channelof energy in your body that houses somuch intelligence be mindful of the baseof your spine right up to the back ofyour neck lengthen your spine sittingtaller and taller lean slightly back toalign your shoulders over your hipsand now with this upright position andthis aligned posture keep your innerfocus into your spine and observe ifthere's any pain in your body or anyareas and the torso or the hips thatfeel numb or darkinto those tight or painful spacesbreathe a little brighter breathe alittle deeper wake up your whole bodywith breath to this moment right nowremembering that it's very natural forour minds to try and distract us becausethat's what the mind is accustomed todoing the mind is well trained to thinkso just be mindful of those thoughts andkeep focusing back on your breathsoftness as you inhale relaxing as youexhaleno sense for where your breath feelsmost prominent in your bodymaybe you're very aware of your breathat the tip of your nose both nostrilsmay be a coolness on the inhale and awarmth as you exhalemaybe a lift of the chest as you breatheperhaps you envision your inhale flowingup your spine from the base up to theshoulders and perhaps you envision theexhale flowing down your spinal columnrest your focus for a couple minutes onwherever you most strongly connect toyour breath in your bodyknowing that our thoughts will alwaystry to take us out of the moment andhook us and mindfulness is called apractice because we're constantlyencouraged to practice coming back tothe breath come back to the breath overand overobserve if the inhales are long and deepobserve if your breath is a little moreshallowbeing very conscious of where you feelyour breath mouths most in your body isa great technique a great practice ofmindfulness and so is the use of aninner mantra that you can repeatsilently to yourself Tecna Hahn is ahighly esteemed Buddhist monk who offersa really simple and really relaxingmantra to help focus our minds on ourbreath and we'll work with that rightnow for our last couple minutes sittingtogether think to yourself as you inhaleI know I'm inhaling and think as youexhale I smile softly I think I know I'minhaling or I feel my inhale and on theexhale I smile softly often when wefocus in a mindfulness practice likethis our face really tenses up becausewe're trying so hard to concentrate asmuch as possible we want to bring insoftness and gentleness remindingourselves it's okay to relax and reallyit's important that we learn how torelax so keep working with that think Iknow I'm inhaling or I feel my inhaleand on the exhale I smile softlyI know I'm inhaling and on the exhale Ismile softlyin this simple practice of mindfulnesson the breath we've kept a very lightand gentle focus on the breath and howit feels in the body in order to bringin more presence and more consciousthought patterns acknowledge yourselffor taking this time and remember thatevery little moment you can pause andtake a deep breath is beneficial towardsyour nervous system and towards how youfeel and interact in the world it justtakes a couple deep breaths and you canpractice this anywhere anytime no amountof time is too short namaste,17,UCx3BgYuT1eqkI70_1c4rD-Q,頂成有限公司,0,0,0,1,"['CeramicSpeed', 'lululemon', 'Evelyn Stevens',

hey guys I'm Brett Larkin and this is avery special day because I have with meHelen from chic topia which is a YouTubechannel of DIY fashion they have allsorts of great stuff and we're doing acollaboration in which Helen is comingto talk to me about yoga pants and theyare doing a video with me about athletictrends so make sure to catch their videoon their channel as well now I broughtHelen in because I don't know about youguys but it seemed a little suspiciousto me that you know Athleta yoga pantswere maybe 40 or 60 dollars andLululemon is sometimes a hundred dollarsor more and I wanted to kind of sit witha fashion expert and look at the tags ofwhat these pants are really made of youknow what are we putting on our bodywhat are we really buying here to see ifthere's actually a difference there area favorite of mine these are Lululemonright so we're gonna start with the bigname first right so I'm looking here atthe tag and it says it's 87 percentnylon 13% spandex so what's actuallygoing on here well so nylon is actuallya synthetic fiber um and by synthetic itjust means that it's a material that'sproduced solely in labs it's not likecotton which is organically grown andthat's actually a good thing because itmeans it's greenyeah it's sustainable and it was madepopular as a material to use to wearwhen nylon leggings came out in the 50sand 60s when it's talking so that'sright they make our legs look thin welike that so since then any clothing Iwanted to add a bit of stretchyyou'll see a bit of nylon in there inthe weave or the plan so Lululemon isstretchy for yoga and Micra isessentially spandex so it's a thickermaterial that's meant to also providestretching use but also durability soyou you sort of get like these shapewearthat's made of spandex you'll see somebra that has some spandex in there so itgives it the thickness that holds yourbutt together and in shape as a littleamenities know yes that is whatLululemon is known for now let's take alook at these athletic pants this onesays it's body 88 percent nylon and 12%lycra yeah so this one to me feels alittle thinner than the lulu probablybecause it had less like rrahit looks like the difference at least interms of material it's really just theratio of nylon to lycra and it lookslike less nylon is more thick and morelike bra is more thick so this one'sthinner overall but it might be betterfor summer now that you say that Iactually remember that you know when Ido wear the Athleta they feel a littlethinner like more lightweight that'sactually really good to know cuz it'snot like one is super better than theother so yeah Paletta might be good forhot yoga or summer and the Lulu's mightbe better for winter more like a half aclass or that kind of thing so now Iwanna shake it up we're going crazy I'mthrowing a third brand into the mix andthis is a lot of people don't know aboutthis brand it's beyond yoga it's one ofmy favorite yoga brands and give this afeel and see what you think oh wow itactually feels very much like cut yeahso I really like this brand beyond yogabecause their pants really feeldifferent than the other two we lookedat as you say it feels kind of likecotton and warm andyeah it's like this stretchy goodnessit's hard to describe so what's actuallygoing on when we look at the label hereyeah so it actually has 90% selects and10% lycra so it's basically a materialthat's meant to feel like cotton andgive it sort of the organic feel butstill provide the stretchiness and thedurability that yoga pants should haveso this one's definitely very uniqueyeah and I highly recommend this brandand that's you know really interestingthat you say that because I always waswondering you know you I know this pantcan't be made of cotton yet it feels socottony so you're saying the blend ofthe the fabrics that they're using isactually designed to do that yeah ohhere's my next big question are thesepants worth what we're payingI mean just the fabrics and how they'remixing them do you think these pants areworth like $100 that you think it's Ithink the marketing I think it reallyjust depends on how often you do yogaokay and because for me for last yearI've done yoga like once so to pay Iwon't get you so to pay $100 might be alittle excessive um that said if you doyoga weekly like what a healthy personshould do $100 is barely investment

Lululemon Luon Wonder Under Leggings,CxmjvvxRCBQ,11986
hey everybody it shall be here at citycentre dance in White Plains New Yorkand I've got a review for you today soI'm gonna talk to you about just theplain luan wonder under along leggingsthe first thing I want to tell you aboutthem is that they are pretty thick andso you know they're not magic pants youknow if you if if your legs are certainshape they're not gonna change the shapeof your legs they're you know they'regonna look good because they're thickbut not you know miraculous or anythingbut what I will say about them is thatthe stitching is what makes them sounique I believe that these leggingslast quadruple the amount of time ofeven the second most expensive bestbrand leggings that I own so I knowthere was a controversy like a coupleyears ago that the owner of Lululemonthe the guy that started the whole brandsaid something awful like if your thighstouch Lululemon was not made for you andI do not support that whatsoeverhowever the irony of the whole thing isthat my review has to do with that veryfact I would say maybe nobody has thighsthat do not touch at a size 6 and so ifthey're gonna make up to 12 and saytheir pants are not for people whosethighs touch that's first of all sooffensive but secondly the reasonthere's leggings are so good is becauseif your thighs do touch and and a lot ofthe time the scenes in a legging willbreak and we'll get holes in them andthen you've to throw out your leggingsnow if you get something like anAmerican Apparel legging you'll have todo that over three months and so youknow when you look at the price theprice is $98 for a plain pair ofLululemon leggings that seems reallyexpensive but my wonder unders ban whotell you my little wonder under aleggings story I had mine for I wouldsay between four and five years and thenI got the first hole in the seam but itwasn't in the legging it was old me inthe scene and so I brought them to Luluand they repaired them for me so Ibasically got a brand new stitch on themand my pants were gonna you know keepgoing and going and then I made thatbecause I'm really short I'm 5 foot 2that even though my leggings all scrunchat the bottom I decided that I wanted toget them a bunch of pairs like eightpairs happened they ended up making themtoo short and we were so lenient aboutpinning them and it just somehowsomething went wrong so the ones I'mwearing right now are actually the pairthey gave me after I I had I broughtthem the damaged pair and they handed mea brand new pair so this $98 of mine hasleft it not only in the five years butnow I have a brand new pair within thatsame hundred dollars that are going toprobably go on for the next five yearsand so their customer service is so goodand that hundred dollars goes such along way that to me it's not evenexpensive for what it is because if Iwas buying $30 legging after $30 leggingover the span of six years I would havewell exceeded $100 now the next thing Iwant to tell you in case you don't knowyou must know this if you are aprofessional dance teacher or yogateacher or something in that vein youalways get a 15% discount at Lululemonon everything you buy that is all thetime no matter what and most people knowthat but every now and then I have saidthat in front of someone who's a danceteacher who like gasped and couldn'tbelieve it and I just want to make sureyou all know that you if you are a danceteacher professionally and can prove ityou get 15% off as an RD I think it'sresearch and development discount onliterally everything you buyso my pants were not even $98 there's15% off of them so I cannot emphasizeenough how great this brand is and howsignificantly I think that hundreddollars is worth it and now I'm going totalk a little bit about the productitself one of the things that's reallynice about them is that there's a littleinner pocket right on the left inside ofright at the top of the pant and there'sa little pocket in there and it will fita credit card of folded up you knowdollar bill $20 bill whatever you needthe actual fabric luan is so um it'slike really good for moisture so youdon't feel like you're sweating in thatand it it's they're still thick andI know there's been some faulty batchesbut they are not see-through for themost part the one thing I would tell youis if you want them to last long andstay really nice-looking don't put themin the dryer and they might pill alittle bit but it's nothing significantand they don't break and so I am givingthese Lululemon leggings a huge twothumbs up there is absolutely no reasonnot to spend the money on them becauseno matter how much you wear them theyare going to last you a million timeslonger than any other legging you haveever tried in your life so um let meknow if you want me to review otherLululemon products I am a crazy crazyLululemon fanatic let me know they wantme to review other brands like Athletathings like that and I will see you inthe next video thanks so much

the really goodquality so with the pandemic going onshipping from Aliexpress has been alittle slower than usual but I thinkthat it's starting to speed up if you'veordered recently and you can leave acomment down below how long it's takenyou but I've got quite a few diems frompeople who have gotten their orderswithin one month of ordering which ispretty good given the circumstances Iactually recently ordered somenavigation dupes video will be comingsoon subscribe if you're not so youdon't miss the review but I actuallyordered them from a different la Expressseller and they took three entire monthsto get here but they still did come so Iknow sometimes people lose hope with herAliexpress packages but you know butmine always seemed to end up comingNepal gym right now should take like

close-upand then there's Pinto sitting on someJim shark returns Pitt does is a signnot to return them so first we finallygot the vital seamless short Stoops Ihate saying short Stoops the vital seamust have become my favorite Jim sharkDux out of all of them like I like themore like the energy seamless ombre Ijust love the vitals I'll Express hasalso made some improvements to thevitals over the year the waistbanddoesn't Gabe anymore and they're a lotmore stretchy and more soft anyway thesehave a thick ribbed waistband they havea little vital dot contouring going downthe frontthey are totally seamless in thethey're also a four inch inseam in theback they have that little line thatseparates the booty cheeks a little bitjust to kind of make it less unibit butit's not like a seam or anything's justlike a little raised line and the dotsalso do come under the booty so youstill get a little booty contour thecrotch is actually a full like gussetcrotch that extends down to the littlelegs so camel should not be an issuehere's a close-up of the fabric this isthe khaki marl it's super stretchy alsovery thick and plush this type of fabricis very pill resistant as well thesecome in a bunch of colors but I also gotthe pistachio green which I love thiscolor as well as this teal blue I wear asize extra small in the leggings but Ifind the shorts are a little more trueto size all right so here are the vitalseamless shorts these are besides smalllike I said before I wear an extra smallin the leggings which is affiance downfor me in those fit perfectly but Iwould go with your normal size and theshorts as you can see these are smalland they're fitting me in the waistthey're nice and snug but they're notlook too tight so definitely wouldrecommend going with your normal sizethe shorts themselves are around amedium compression but the waistbandactually gives a pretty good amount ofcompression it goes a little bit abovemy belly button which is a desiredheight for me I feel like it's reallylike holding in the waist like thatI like how even though these are shortsthey still have the booty contour sothey still are very flattering seamlessfront so no camel so there are a 4 inchinseam they will have a little risk forrolling up I have to say I haven't hadtoo much of an issue with it when I wasworking out it was finebut if I do too much walking eventuallyit does roll up a little bit so just bemindful they also do cut into my thighsa little bit on the bottom just becausethe band is a little bit tight Iwouldn't say it's uncomfortable but ifyou hate shorts that cut into you at alllike these do still cut into me a littlebit as you can see I'd say there saw amedium to high on the booty scale I lovethe little booty contour and all theseparation helps a lot I sue celluliteI'd say they'd be pretty cellulitefriendly because of the marled materialbooty contour but yeah I love theseshorts I've always been a fan of thevital seamless so in fact they finallygot the shorts makes me very I justwanted to pop on and say basically theyfit exactly the same I've always foundthat this color is just a little bitthinner a little stretch here and alittle less squat proof so I might keepthis color to upper body days[Music]and to go with the shorts they do havevital seamless sports bras but theydidn't make new ones to go with thesebecause these are still old colors soall of the old vital seamless sportsbras will still be around for you to getto match the shorts but they did alsocome out with a little short sleeve croptops which is good because I don't likelong sleeve cropped tops I have a bunchof them and it's like when do I want mystomach to be cold but my arms to bewarm like these are made of the samematerial as the shorts the colors matchand everything they have a little jotcontour in the front that kind of likecurves around the boobs it's not verybold or anythinghe brought me one of his spree toys heythank you oh my gosh eyes are glued toit the little dot detail also goes downthe side and a little bit on to the backas wellthe bottom of the top is slightly ribbedjust gives a little more hold so itstays down yeah just a simple cap sleeveoh crop so next we have the vital shortsleeve crop top I always loved anopposing versions of the like Jim sharkgoop crop tops because they always makeit a little longer here so it's neverlike right on your sports bra band andthey always stay up really well when youlift your arms like I never have anissue with it riding up or anything thisisn't a size small and it is snug but Iwouldn't say it's uncomfortable or tocompressive or anything so I would gotrue to size I wear small and sportsbras and I guess a small medium in sometops but I'm wearing small in this Ithink it's fine I think this style ofcrotch tea just looks good if it's likea little more fitted rather than loosebut that's just me it will show a littlebit of Pitt sweat because it's not 100%sweat proof and kind of it happens inshort sleeve crop tops it has a littledot detailing here and I thought thiswas a mistake at first I think itactually is like a part of the top ithas those little rays seeing things thatthe short tab on the back to separatethe booty it has those like under likethe boob area I don't really know whatthat's supposed to do but it's not verynoticeableit is a crewneck so it goes pretty closeto your neck and the cap sleeves aren'toverly tight so I like that tooin the back of some more of the dottedcontoured detailing I love the khaki setpersonally this is my favorite of thevinyl seamless colors[Music]next we have the physical shorts theseare a six inch inseam which I'm gladthey finally made some six and shortsanything below a five inch inseam likefour inch and seems like those my thighsjust eat them right up but when you havea little extra length that's just likethe ultimate key to not having yourshorts right up so I love these becausethey don't write up these are also agreat dupe for Lulu Mandel line shortsthey're basically the exact same shapein the fabric is also very soft and thealigned shorts also do come in a sixinch the aligned towards sell out prettyeasily so these these aren't a small andlittle olive green color and here's thefabric it's super soft it's pretty thinand stretchy but it wouldn't say it'slike super brushed a little less brushthan an a-line but still like very softthey have a seamless waistband they haveone of those little like internal pocketthings in the waistband that I never endup using the scenes are just straightalong the back there's similar toLululemon and they do have an extendedgusset crotch also like the align shortsthese come in a few colors but they alsocome in a black camo which is also verycute neutral okay so here the physicalshorts I'm wearing a size small usuallyI'm between a small and medium andshorts and I am wearing the size smalland I think that this is my preferredsize so I love the six inch inseam I'veworn these on walks and they don't rollup because they kind of go past like thethickest part of your thighs they'rejust the perfect length I love this likethe shorts and like these might be theclosest thing to an a-line short dupethat I've ever found if you guys followme and everything you know I love thecolorful koala shorts but I would saythese are even closer to aniline doopthan those because they're a littlethinner and the fabric is like reallyclose to the Lululemon aligned fabricit's like super light weight slightlybrushed and these are really really softthe weights be at the high-rise it goesright to my belly button and there's noseam at the top so it's not giving meany muffin top or anything it has aFrench seam so there is a little riskfor camel but it's not really an issuewith me I'm also not getting any fabricgathering or anything so I feel like thesmall is a pretty good fit on me thisvaccine here could be a little higher upfor me if I wanted to be like a littlemore flattering on the booty buthonestly the loo I mean one of they'rethe same on me like I wish that the seamis a little bit higher so I give thesejust like a medium I'm a potentiallymedium high on the booty scale I feellike I could pull them up and make thema little more flattering but then youget less length on the leg and it pullsup a little more in front so you can dothisto make them a little more flatteringbut and because this is more of like alightweight like stretching yourmaterial I'm really not getting themcutting into my thighs the seam at thebottom really is not cutting into me atall like this is pretty goodI wouldn't say you get a lot ofcellulite coverage out of these andthey're probably not like the most sweatproof just because of the soft brushedfabric but yeah I really like these theyfeel like really really close toLululemon like I'm actually shockedright now and I expect to like these asmuch as I doI mean I was gonna buy the six-inch lulushorts and now I'm just gonna stick withthese say I'm a huge fan feel likereally buttery soft shorts performshorts they're also super super stretchyso I wouldn't expect any restriction ofany movement I will definitely bewearing these to the gym Ian's dog walks[Music]next we have the perform cycling shortsso these are a 10 inch inseam so they'redefinitely like a classic biker shortlength the waistline is also pretty highon these like there's a decent amount ofspace they're very similar overall tothe perform shorts they just have alonger and see you in a slightly higherwaistband they're also a seamlesswaistband and they have that same littleinternal pocket in the waistband prettymuch straight across seams they alsohave an extended crotch gusset that goesdown most of the leg but it ends likeabout an inch or two before this shouldbe the same material as we performshorts these ones particularly feelslightly less brushed but they're notlike a slick material still very softand very stretchy I also got them in thelittle mustard yellow color which Ican't decide if I love or hate thiscolor you can't be neutral on this coloryou either hate knew you'd love italright so here are the bike shortswhenever I first put bike shorts on Ialways think that I hate them and then Ilook at myself a little more on them andI wear them around and I just end upreally liking them I don't know ifthey're the cutest on me like I don'tknow if they're very flattering on mylegs because sometimes I feel like I'vestubby likes compared to my height I'mtall but my legs are kind of shortthey're also very thick got some thickcalves anyway so you feel a little moresleek a little less brushed than thephysical shorts but still very softstretchy and lightweight I would stillcall these like a Lululemon a line bikeshort dupe the waist is also definitelyhigher than the physical shorts on thephysical shorts it went like right belowmy belly button and these go above mybelly button and I did not pull them upany extra or anything like this is justhow the waistband is so is a higherwaistband and definitely a longer inseamit does have that extended crotch gussetand it just ends like two inches belowthe bottom band the bottom and it's likea little bit tight on me I would like ifit was just like a little bit looserlike the physical shorts the band wasnot restricting at all and these they'renot necessarily squishing my thighsbecause they're so low down on my legthat there's not like as much likemeatiness down there to squish you knowbut they are just a little bit tighterand I'm definitely noticing I'm feelingthe tightness so again there is a frontseam and I'm not really getting anycamel but there's definitely apossibility I'm wearing size small againI would definitely say go with yournormal legging size these have about amedium compression all around thephysical short something felt more of alight compression so you are getting alittle more hold in these which justfeels good with the longer shorts and Ifeel lisen held in will giveanother medium on the booty scaledefinitely not good squish down oranything but this little band could justbe a little bit higher in my opinionit's you know accentuate the glutes goabove the glutes but it's kind of alittle bit on the glutes probably won'tget a ton of cellulite coverage in theseeither because the fabric is stillpretty thin these are also superstretchy so I'm not gonna get anyrestrictionsyeah these actually impressed me one Ithought they would I just the biggestthing is just this little tight band atthe bottom it was a little bit looserbut if you're like they're a littleshorter than mine they'll go a littlebit more to your knees and then it won'treally feel as tight also my thighs kindof thick so next we have the posturecapris which I'm personally not a hugefan of capris they just accentuate mygiant calves but if you do like caprisand you like the Napoleon rhythmleggings these are the rhythm leggingsbut in capri form they have a seamlesswaistband and they have no friend seamso no possibility of camel just a littlecrotch gusset here and we have the nicecurved booty seams so they're veryflattering on the booty boys feet isjust a little bit tapered you'll see thelength and have them on but they goBullock below the knee mid calf here'sthe fabric it's a nice brushed supersoftmaterial very similar to the rhythmsalright so last for the bottoms we havethe capris they're made of a supersoftbrushed fabric they only have about alight compression I'm wearing these in asize small and they fit just fine butwith the rythm leggings usually I sizedown to an extra small and that kind ofprevents them from sliding down at all Ifeel like I could see these sliding downa little bit in this size small so Iwould potentially size down and they'rereally stretchy so I wouldn't worryabout them like not fitting in your sizedown like most people I know half sizedown no problemhigh-rise for right to the belly buttonand I have a seamless waistbandno front seam high on the booty scalethey have this curved booty seems thatthey actually go above your butt interms of length they go about twomid-calf which is never the mostcomfortable point for me because mycalves are really big so usually theysquish it into them I would say the bandat the bottom of these actually isn'tsuper tight so it's actually not cuttinginto me a ton but I just I will neverlike Caprice I'll never wear a Capri soif you do like a pries I like theoverall shape of these like they're goodpair of leggingsI'm just personally not youthree persons these are not going to bethe most cellulite friendly because theyare just pretty thin and lightweightthere's nothing wrong with a littlecellulite you know and yeah I definitelyfeel like I'm pulling these up a littlebit so I would definitely go to yoursize down if you go with the capris weactually have a matching sports bra Iwould love to see more matching setsfrom Nepal Jen because I love the rhythmleggings but I always have to wear likea different bra with it because theydon't have any bras that like directlymatch but these actually match this isthe magic rushed cross back sports brait feels like a slightly thicker versionof the same brush material that thecapris are made out of but it feelsreally plush and soft it has removablecut pads which I don't love but it doeshave that little seam in the middle ofthe cup has so they can't like crossover and like give you a little unibooblike they say in their lanes it's almosta longline sports bra it does have asolid like two inch band here that willgo a little bit onto your torso so alittle more coverage than most sportsfor us it also has double crisscrossstraps that go on to the back anywayshere is the magic sports bra and Iactually really like it I always like abra that comes down a little bit likeit's like longline sports bra you end upjust showing a little less skin if youare just going with a sports bra andleggings I'm wearing a size small and itwould say true to size if it's reallywell in the band and I like this bottomband because it doesn't actually haveany like harsh elastics or anything soit's not cutting into me at all it feelsvery soft the actual body of the sportsbra is a nice double thickness it'sactually giving me a pretty good amountof like a compression it's a porch Iwould say this is a medium maybe mediumhigh support definitely if you a smallercup size this is totally a high supportI'm actually pretty impressed with thejiggle resistance of this one there'sthe tiniest bit of side boob but notenough to bother me I think this is agood amount of scoop to the neckline Idon't feel like it's totally cleavageI'm not like too exposed but it's a nicelike open neck the fabric is super supersoft and brushed and the back just has acutecrisscross detail[Music]so that is it for the affordable shortsreview plus a few little bonus items Ihope this video was helpful again if youuse any of my codes

but still very soft stretchy andlightweight they still are veryflattering and like these might be theclosest thing to an a-line short dupethat I've ever found hey guys andwelcome back to my channel today we aredoing a super highly requested review offor summer we are doing a bunch ofaffordable shorts we have some vitalseamless short stoop with some bikershorts which are dupes for the Lululemonaligned biker shorts and we got somemore is six and shorts which are alsokind of aligned short dupes it's been awhile since I've done an opponent reviewif you're new here in a podium was anAliexpress seller and now they havetheir own website but I still sell onAliexpress so I'm gonna post all thelinks to both their website andAliexpress down below all of theseshorts are around $20 in the really goodquality so with the pandemic going onshipping from Aliexpress has been alittle slower than usual but I thinkthat it's starting to speed up if you'veordered recently and you can leave acomment down below how long it's takenyou but I've got quite a few diems frompeople who have gotten their orderswithin one month of ordering which ispretty good given the circumstances Iactually recently ordered somenavigation dupes video will be comingsoon subscribe if you're not so youdon't miss the review but I actuallyordered them from a different la Expressseller and they took three entire monthsto get here but they still did come so Iknow sometimes people lose hope with herAliexpress packages but you know butmine always seemed to end up comingNepal gym right now should take like 3to 4 weeks ok now on to the review bythe way I do have discount codes forpodiums website I will put them downbelow but also put them up on the screenheremy old de poche I'm Aliexpress codeexpired it like expires that really likea couple months or so so if I get a newone by the time I post this video I willput it on the screen if you ever use anyof my codes feel free to send me ascreenshot over Instagram DM and I willenter you in my monthly giveaway withoutfurther ado let's start reviewingfilming assistants have gotten positionfor my review Pete you ready to film youready for your close-upand then there's Pinto sitting on someJim shark returns Pitt does is a signnot to return them so first we finallygot the vital seamless short Stoops Ihate saying short Stoops the vital seamust have become my favorite Jim sharkDux out of all of them like I like themore like the energy seamless ombre Ijust love the vitals I'll Express hasalso made some improvements to thevitals over the year the waistbanddoesn't Gabe anymore and they're a lotmore stretchy and more soft anyway thesehave a thick ribbed waistband they havea little vital dot contouring going downthe frontthey are totally seamless in thethey're also a four inch inseam in theback they have that little line thatseparates the booty cheeks a little bitjust to kind of make it less unibit butit's not like a seam or anything's justlike a little raised line and the dotsalso do come under the booty so youstill get a little booty contour thecrotch is actually a full like gussetcrotch that extends down to the littlelegs so camel should not be an issuehere's a close-up of the fabric this isthe khaki marl it's super stretchy alsovery thick and plush this type of fabricis very pill resistant as well thesecome in a bunch of colors but I also gotthe pistachio green which I love thiscolor as well as this teal blue I wear asize extra small in the leggings but Ifind the shorts are a little more trueto size all right so here are the vitalseamless shorts these are besides smalllike I said before I wear an extra smallin the leggings which is affiance downfor me in those fit perfectly but Iwould go with your normal size and theshorts as you can see these are smalland they're fitting me in the waistthey're nice and snug but they're notlook too tight so definitely wouldrecommend going with your normal sizethe shorts themselves are around amedium compression but the waistbandactually gives a pretty good amount ofcompression it goes a little bit abovemy belly button which is a desiredheight for me I feel like it's reallylike holding in the waist like thatI like how even though these are shortsthey still have the booty contour sothey still are very flattering seamlessfront so no camel so there are a 4 inchinseam they will have a little risk forrolling up I have to say I haven't hadtoo much of an issue with it when I wasworking out it was finebut if I do too much walking eventuallyit does roll up a little bit so just bemindful they also do cut into my thighsa little bit on the bottom just becausethe band is a little bit tight Iwouldn't say it's uncomfortable but ifyou hate shorts that cut into you at alllike these do still cut into me a littlebit as you can see I'd say there saw amedium to high on the booty scale I lovethe little booty contour and all theseparation helps a lot I sue celluliteI'd say they'd be pretty cellulitefriendly because of the marled materialbooty contour but yeah I love theseshorts I've always been a fan of thevital seamless so in fact they finallygot the shorts makes me very I justwanted to pop on and say basically theyfit exactly the same I've always foundthat this color is just a little bitthinner a little stretch here and alittle less squat proof so I might keepthis color to upper body days[Music]and to go with the shorts they do havevital seamless sports bras but theydidn't make new ones to go with thesebecause these are still old colors soall of the old vital seamless sportsbras will still be around for you to getto match the shorts but they did alsocome out with a little short sleeve croptops which is good because I don't likelong sleeve cropped tops I have a bunchof them and it's like when do I want mystomach to be cold but my arms to bewarm like these are made of the samematerial as the shorts the colors matchand everything they have a little jotcontour in the front that kind of likecurves around the boobs it's not verybold or anythinghe brought me one of his spree toys heythank you oh my gosh eyes are glued toit the little dot detail also goes downthe side and a little bit on to the backas wellthe bottom of the top is slightly ribbedjust gives a little more hold so itstays down yeah just a simple cap sleeveoh crop so next we have the vital shortsleeve crop top I always loved anopposing versions of the like Jim sharkgoop crop tops because they always makeit a little longer here so it's neverlike right on your sports bra band andthey always stay up really well when youlift your arms like I never have anissue with it riding up or anything thisisn't a size small and it is snug but Iwouldn't say it's uncomfortable or tocompressive or anything so I would gotrue to size I wear small and sportsbras and I guess a small medium in sometops but I'm wearing small in this Ithink it's fine I think this style ofcrotch tea just looks good if it's likea little more fitted rather than loosebut that's just me it will show a littlebit of Pitt sweat because it's not 100%sweat proof and kind of it happens inshort sleeve crop tops it has a littledot detailing here and I thought thiswas a mistake at first I think itactually is like a part of the top ithas those little rays seeing things thatthe short tab on the back to separatethe booty it has those like under likethe boob area I don't really know whatthat's supposed to do but it's not verynoticeableit is a crewneck so it goes pretty closeto your neck and the cap sleeves aren'toverly tight so I like that tooin the back of some more of the dottedcontoured detailing I love the khaki setpersonally this is my favorite of thevinyl seamless colors[Music]next we have the physical shorts theseare a six inch inseam which I'm gladthey finally made some six and shortsanything below a five inch inseam likefour inch and seems like those my thighsjust eat them right up but when you havea little extra length that's just likethe ultimate key to not having yourshorts right up so I love these becausethey don't write up these are also agreat dupe for Lulu Mandel line shortsthey're basically the exact same shapein the fabric is also very soft and thealigned shorts also do come in a sixinch the aligned towards sell out prettyeasily so these these aren't a small andlittle olive green color and here's thefabric it's super soft it's pretty thinand stretchy but it wouldn't say it'slike super brushed a little less brushthan an a-line but still like very softthey have a seamless waistband they haveone of those little like internal pocketthings in the waistband that I never endup using the scenes are just straightalong the back there's similar toLululemon and they do have an extendedgusset crotch also like the align shortsthese come in a few colors but they alsocome in a black camo which is also verycute neutral okay so here the physicalshorts I'm wearing a size small usuallyI'm between a small and medium andshorts and I am wearing the size smalland I think that this is my preferredsize so I love the six inch inseam I'veworn these on walks and they don't rollup because they kind of go past like thethickest part of your thighs they'rejust the perfect length I love this likethe shorts and like these might be theclosest thing to an a-line short dupethat I've ever found if you guys followme and everything you know I love thecolorful koala shorts but I would saythese are even closer to aniline doopthan those because they're a littlethinner and the fabric is like reallyclose to the Lululemon aligned fabricit's like super light weight slightlybrushed and these are really really softthe weights be at the high-rise it goesright to my belly button and there's noseam at the top so it's not giving meany muffin top or anything it has aFrench seam so there is a little riskfor camel but it's not really an issuewith me I'm also not getting any fabricgathering or anything so I feel like thesmall is a pretty good fit on me thisvaccine here could be a little higher upfor me if I wanted to be like a littlemore flattering on the booty buthonestly the loo I mean one of they'rethe same on me like I wish that the seamis a little bit higher so I give thesejust like a medium I'm a potentiallymedium high on the booty scale I feellike I could pull them up and make thema little more flattering but then youget less length on the leg and it pullsup a little more in front so you can dothisto make them a little more flatteringbut and because this is more of like alightweight like stretching yourmaterial I'm really not getting themcutting into my thighs the seam at thebottom really is not cutting into me atall like this is pretty goodI wouldn't say you get a lot ofcellulite coverage out of these andthey're probably not like the most sweatproof just because of the soft brushedfabric but yeah I really like these theyfeel like really really close toLululemon like I'm actually shockedright now and I expect to like these asmuch as I doI mean I was gonna buy the six-inch lulushorts and now I'm just gonna stick withthese say I'm a huge fan feel likereally buttery soft shorts performshorts they're also super super stretchyso I wouldn't expect any restriction ofany movement I will definitely bewearing these to the gym Ian's dog walks[Music]next we have the perform cycling shortsso these are a 10 inch inseam so they'redefinitely like a classic biker shortlength the waistline is also pretty highon these like there's a decent amount ofspace they're very similar overall tothe perform shorts they just have alonger and see you in a slightly higherwaistband they're also a seamlesswaistband and they have that same littleinternal pocket in the waistband prettymuch straight across seams they alsohave an extended crotch gusset that goesdown most of the leg but it ends likeabout an inch or two before this shouldbe the same material as we performshorts these ones particularly feelslightly less brushed but they're notlike a slick material still very softand very stretchy I also got them in thelittle mustard yellow color which Ican't decide if I love or hate thiscolor you can't be neutral on this coloryou either hate knew you'd love italright so here are the bike shortswhenever I first put bike shorts on Ialways think that I hate them and then Ilook at myself a little more on them andI wear them around and I just end upreally liking them I don't know ifthey're the cutest on me like I don'tknow if they're very flattering on mylegs because sometimes I feel like I'vestubby likes compared to my height I'mtall but my legs are kind of shortthey're also very thick got some thickcalves anyway so you feel a little moresleek a little less brushed than thephysical shorts but still very softstretchy and lightweight I would stillcall these like a Lululemon a line bikeshort dupe the waist is also definitelyhigher than the physical shorts on thephysical shorts it went like right belowmy belly button and these go above mybelly button and I did not pull them upany extra or anything like this is justhow the waistband is so is a higherwaistband and definitely a longer inseamit does have that extended crotch gussetand it just ends like two inches belowthe bottom band the bottom and it's likea little bit tight on me I would like ifit was just like a little bit looserlike the physical shorts the band wasnot restricting at all and these they'renot necessarily squishing my thighsbecause they're so low down on my legthat there's not like as much likemeatiness down there to squish you knowbut they are just a little bit tighterand I'm definitely noticing I'm feelingthe tightness so again there is a frontseam and I'm not really getting anycamel but there's definitely apossibility I'm wearing size small againI would definitely say go with yournormal legging size these have about amedium compression all around thephysical short something felt more of alight compression so you are getting alittle more hold in these which justfeels good with the longer shorts and Ifeel lisen held in will giveanother medium on the booty scaledefinitely not good squish down oranything but this little band could justbe a little bit higher in my opinionit's you know accentuate the glutes goabove the glutes but it's kind of alittle bit on the glutes probably won'tget a ton of cellulite coverage in theseeither because the fabric is stillpretty thin these are also superstretchy so I'm not gonna get anyrestrictionsyeah these actually impressed me one Ithought they would I just the biggestthing is just this little tight band atthe bottom it was a little bit looserbut if you're like they're a littleshorter than mine they'll go a littlebit more to your knees and then it won'treally feel as tight also my thighs kindof thick so next we have the posturecapris which I'm personally not a hugefan of capris they just accentuate mygiant calves but if you do like caprisand you like the Napoleon rhythmleggings these are the rhythm leggingsbut in capri form they have a seamlesswaistband and they have no friend seamso no possibility of camel just a littlecrotch gusset here and we have the nicecurved booty seams so they're veryflattering on the booty boys feet isjust a little bit tapered you'll see thelength and have them on but they goBullock below the knee mid calf here'sthe fabric it's a nice brushed supersoftmaterial very similar to the rhythmsalright so last for the bottoms we havethe capris they're made of a supersoftbrushed fabric they only have about alight compression I'm wearing these in asize small and they fit just fine butwith the rythm leggings usually I sizedown to an extra small and that kind ofprevents them from sliding down at all Ifeel like I could see these sliding downa little bit in this size small so Iwould potentially size down and they'rereally stretchy so I wouldn't worryabout them like not fitting in your sizedown like most people I know half sizedown no problemhigh-rise for right to the belly buttonand I have a seamless waistbandno front seam high on the booty scalethey have this curved booty seems thatthey actually go above your butt interms of length they go about twomid-calf which is never the mostcomfortable point for me because mycalves are really big so usually theysquish it into them I would say the bandat the bottom of these actually isn'tsuper tight so it's actually not cuttinginto me a ton but I just I will neverlike Caprice I'll never wear a Capri soif you do like a pries I like theoverall shape of these like they're goodpair of leggingsI'm just personally not youthree persons these are not going to bethe most cellulite friendly because theyare just pretty thin and lightweightthere's nothing wrong with a littlecellulite you know and yeah I definitelyfeel like I'm pulling these up a littlebit so I would definitely go to yoursize down if you go with the capris weactually have a matching sports bra Iwould love to see more matching setsfrom Nepal Jen because I love the rhythmleggings but I always have to wear likea different bra with it because theydon't have any bras that like directlymatch but these actually match this isthe magic rushed cross back sports brait feels like a slightly thicker versionof the same brush material that thecapris are made out of but it feelsreally plush and soft it has removablecut pads which I don't love but it doeshave that little seam in the middle ofthe cup has so they can't like crossover and like give you a little unibooblike they say in their lanes it's almosta longline sports bra it does have asolid like two inch band here that willgo a little bit onto your torso so alittle more coverage than most sportsfor us it also has double crisscrossstraps that go on to the back anywayshere is the magic sports bra and Iactually really like it I always like abra that comes down a little bit likeit's like longline sports bra you end upjust showing a little less skin if youare just going with a sports bra andleggings I'm wearing a size small and itwould say true to size if it's reallywell in the band and I like this bottomband because it doesn't actually haveany like harsh elastics or anything soit's not cutting into me at all it feelsvery soft the actual body of the sportsbra is a nice double thickness it'sactually giving me a pretty good amountof like a compression it's a porch Iwould say this is a medium maybe mediumhigh support definitely if you a smallercup size this is totally a high supportI'm actually pretty impressed with thejiggle resistance of this one there'sthe tiniest bit of side boob but notenough to bother me I think this is agood amount of scoop to the neckline Idon't feel like it's totally cleavageI'm not like too exposed but it's a nicelike open neck the fabric is super supersoft and brushed and the back just has acutecrisscross detail[Music]so that is it for the affordable shortsreview plus a few little bonus items Ihope this video was helpful again if youuse any of my codes

it is quitepossibly one of my favoriteitems ever sports bras yes so todaywe're going to be tryingfour different sports bras from fourdifferent storesin four different sizes amazon airy gymshark and lululemonall of these bras are said to be mediumsupport with like very similarstructures so that we can compare themfairly and accurately and we're allwearing oursizes that we normally would order tolet you guys know if we feel like it'strue to sizei love sports bras i don't have anythingnegative to say about themum other than the fact that sometimes iguess it's just hard when you have bigtattoostrying to work out and they don't reallyhold you the support can be bad but justgotta find a good one i hate real bras iwanna burn every single bra that isn't asports brain my drawer right now sports bras arereally the only thing i wear these daysi'm wearing one right now i've actuallyhave never purchased a sports bra fromthese stores which is really odd becausei have tried sports brasfrom everywhere for me i wear an extrasmall in sports brai'm going to be trying on sports bras inthis sizesmall i will be trying on all of mysports bras in a sizemedium i'm going to be trying on a sizelarge and i'm going to put them to theultimate test because i actually havean at-home gym and see if these brasactually holdthese babies in sports bras areessential so hopefully we find a winneri know not everything's a competitionbut like today like totally isup is the amazon running girl sports brait's 20and it runs inside the extra smallthrough xxl your girl is wearing a sizemediumand i'm not mad at it i like it it'scomfortable the color is niceit reminds me of febreze i feel like i'mgoing to go out on a jog and see someclouds one of thoselike i don't know how to see them in awhilethe fabric is so nicewhat i like about this is it's trendyand stylish the cut's really flatteringit's really cute in the back feels likeyou would pay 50 or 60for this bra i'm kind of obsessed withthisstraps do not adjust but i don't thinkyou need to adjust themif you need them to be a little bitlonger or shorterthey'll do what you need to do it doesfeel really sturdy like the strapscan hold these big eyes with acombination of it being really tight andalso very thickit's just not working for me and it'snot just because my boobsare swollen it's also the lining righthere that's cutting into my back alittle bit but other than that it givesme cleavage which ivery very much appreciate amazon so uhwhat better way to put it to the testthan actually working out this is thejumping jacktrick do some runs in placewe pretend like i'm working out i'mliking itand for twenty dollars i think it isproviding a pretty gooduh supportive hold the girls are happythey're staying in placenothing's hitting me in the facethis is how people work out[Music]that's enough i like it i like it for 20bucks this one passes the testit's good it's a good sports bra i'm outof breath by just doing that weird thingi just didyou can shimmy you can harlem shake youcould punch somebodyin the face you're good it's actuallyreallyreally supportive like everything isgonna stay in placewhen you're sweaty taking off a wetsports bra is so difficulti think this would actually be reallyeasy and really like comfortable to getin and out offor being from amazon for twenty dollarsi am obsessed and twenty dollars is areally good priceand i do feel like i would still wearthis bra i just don't know if this isnecessarily the bra i would choose todo physical activity and i would wantsomething that makes me feel a littleless trapped i also love to sleep insports brasjust because you know gravity so itwould be comfortable to sleep in butthen it's also tight enoughto do some cardio you know being thatthis is a small and that's kind oftypically what i weari do feel like this is a traditionalsmallif you want a lot of extra support whenyou're working out and youtypically go between a small and amedium a small would probably work foryou i have to say no i don't think it'strue to size it's ever so slight it'sreally just the back that'sthat's a huge bummer because this isfine it's a little bit tight in here butit's not like cutting inthe back is actually cutting in so ithink i'd have to say no it doesn'tclasp but i'm not mad at it it slips onnice and easy and it's true to size iwill say thoughi definitely think i should have sizedown being double d i feel like i shouldhave done a mediumbecause you can tell it's a little bitloose from there but i think the braprovides support it's soft it was easyto put on the material feels really highqualityso i would recommend it you're gonnalike the way you looki guarantee itso the next bra is the arie sports bra iloveairy workout clothes they're socomfortablethis one to me is just a very basicnot that comfortable bra it's black it'ssimple but then when you turn aroundbam look at that look at that look atthe geometric the geometry thearchitectureof it all i do like the little meshdesign to it i feel like it gives it alittle pizzazz it gives you a little bitof asexy feel to it i think the cutouts hitme at like i'm gonna say like fat butyou know just like just kind of likemuffin topping look that looks like atonguelooks like batman's face i'm batmanthe mesh detail is really really niceand i also like thatclasp down here you can actually tie itkind of like a regular brushi'm not as flexible so it's hard for meto likereally get in here and hook it in theright hooksand then to be honest i'm not a big fanof sports bras that have the clamps inthe back because it's so difficult toput onit's like you either have to take thisdown and put it all down hereand then turn it around clasp it icannot i can't just clasp it behind mybacki'm gonna get it just give me some timeit does have three separate clasps soyou could go tighterbut in terms of where it fits i think itfor the most part it's always going tosit like right underneath your boobsand it's going to be kind of low cut ohthank god i think that this part of thebra is niceit's soft it's comfy there's a reallysoft lining which i really likeit looks really high quality and itfeelsincredible the feel is very soft itfeels high quality i think the only partthat's uncomfortable is the fact that ihave the tag still on itother than that i think it's prettycomfortable trying on sports bras inyour periodsnot very accurate because my boobs arepainful right now so everything feels alittle bit tight in the boob areaand the cleavage just shows thatsomething something's going onhormonally it's like a crime scene in mypantslet's see how well it fallsathleticism check it feels good it's nottoo bad they're staying in place thisone deserves five starsas long as they don't slap me in thechin we're good the girls are happy theyare staying the place they're securethis is gonna go down as one of myfavorite sports brasi definitely plan to invest in sizemediumsand like medium support yes but i thinkthat means i like medium support becausei feel like if it was evenany more supportive i wouldn't be ableto breathe because it's like suckingdown on me you know like you want themto be contained but you don't want themto be likei love it i don't love it and it's hardfor me because i'm wearing airy leggingsright now those likecross leggings that we got from theleggings video on the channel it's justthis back part that isn'tquite working for me and my body typeand the size39.50 i think that's a pretty good pricefor a sports bra like ihave some sports bras that are easy like75 sothe fact that this is good support andit's cutegets the job done i think it's totallyworth the money medium true to sizetrue size i like it i can tell you rightnow as someone who typically orders asmall in sports brasthat this one actually is like a littletoo small for medefinitely do feel like this is true tosize you know um yeseverything's a little bit tight righthere but in the back it feels reallyniceand i don't feel trapped in this and ithink it's because the material isreally really softi will say once again i should have sizedown i definitely plan to investin size mediums i hope they have morecolori think it's a great value i think it'sa good price i think it's affordable foreveryoneit does provide a lot of cushion so youdon't get nippolitisif i did go up to a medium i think iwould like ita little bit better it's not bad qualityit's good qualityi just don't think it's the bra for me[Music]gym shark adapt animal seamless sportsbrathis sports bra i can already tell it'sgoing to go down as one of my favoritesfor only45 it feels like those bandeau dressesyou know those kim kardashian likereally tight dresses that suck you inthat's what the sports bra feels like soit doesn't adjust but i appreciate thevikaand i appreciate just the support theoverall holdthis one is really hard to get intoagain because there is a lot ofstructure to it it is avery supportive like the best friendthat you need right now supportive checkthe cleavage asking you shall receivethis is what wewanted like i'm going to work out butthen i'm also likehave boobs you know i am busting out ofitand i don't think i can attribute thatto being on my period i actually justthink this isa little too small it's not verycomfortable if you know what i mean ilove the color i love they offer a lotof different colors in this styleand i feel like the boys look good theylook bigger than what they actually arein real life which you know we alwayscan appreciate at first i didn't likethe patterni was like it looks a little like likescarybut now i like it it's very subtle andcalmingand like makes me want to have asmoothie and burn some incense andlisten to enya[Music]the back is very cute check this outthey're not adjustable but they stillhave that samecross situation and they're reallystretchy so if you need them to betighteruntil they'll compress if you need themto be longer they'll stretch outi do almost feel like this could be up alittle further or down a little furtherit kind of hits in like aright across the nipple area which seemsa little bitdifferent the band though is really nicei do appreciate that it's a little bitlonger so if you wear the high-waistedpants and your shirt your bra's a littlelonger you feel a little morecomfortable showing a littlequarantine belly because a lot of timeswith sports bras especially with theones i sleep insometimes they ride up overnight and youget a little nipbut this is tight enough and thickenough where i feel like it nothing isgoing to ride upeven though my boob is popping out alittle bituh everything else doesn't feel tight idon't feel restrictive i like thatthere's a lot of space right herebetween my armpit and the brajumping test let's put it to the testoh it feels good i don't thinkanything's movingthis one is definitely more bouncyi feel secure i feel confidentbut still very comfortable which issaying a lotthis bra definitely passed the test andi think it goes down as one of myfavorites i've never bought anythingfrom gymshark one thing i can't sayabout gymshark products since i haveacquired some over the last year or twothey last a really long time and theirquality is really really goodover time they're gonna wear downperfectly and like meld with your bodyif i worked out hardcore i would wearthis one all the timei don't know if this is true to size tobe honest with you like everythingfits really really nicely but i alsodon't thinki'm busting out of it because my boobsare swollen i think i'm busting out ofit because it is a little bit tighti think if you normally get a small asmall will fit you if you want a moreloungy comfy braa medium probably works maybe a littlebit better i wear a medium and sportsbras but my bra size is either a 32d or 34 double d so if you fall intothat rangeyou get this sports bra and a mediumit's good so for mediumthis is true to size i think i wouldstick to the largebecause if i would have ordered asmaller one i think it would have been alittle too tighti would definitely size up and i'dprobably be more comfortablein a bigger size just because this is alittle hoytin the front this one feels like it'smore universal in its style a lot ofdifferent body types couldwear this and think it was comfortablethis is nice never tried this brandbefore and i am impressed i'm definitelyimpressedthe fourth sports bra is from lululemoncoming in at52 so initial reactionthe sports bra is very soft it was easyto put on it's very stretchy you cantell the material high qualitybut i don't think it's going to providethe support that i needit's cute it's really simple i thinkwhat makes it reallydifferent from just a basic sports brais the way the straps are it does likethis littlelike camel toe thing which i like not agood enough reason to use the word camoit does not have a claspin the back it's just an over theshoulder pull it over your space bunsand try not to mess them up sports brathe back is really really nice again noadjustable straps but it isso forgiving and so nice if you can telli would prefer this to be a lot tighterand i do like when you can adjust thestraps but it didn't bother me in thiscase thatyou cannot adjust the straps this is myfavorite back out of all of thembecause of the lighting i'm sayingaround the window it looks white butit's actually this really cutelike baby pink which just makes me feellike very feminineand just soft like some cotton candy nowthat i have it oni do think it fits really well i thinkthe shapingof where the straps are it's veryflatteringi love the straps in the back it's areally cute design i really don't thinkthe fabric is as soft as the amazon brawhich is kind of sad to me because ireally want a comfybuttery bra but i want to feel like idon't even have a bra on it's the seamsand the straps i can just i'm aware ofthem i can feel themrubbing up against my skinthe band is a little bit tight i almostwish the band was the same consistencyas the rest of it because these bandsare unbelievably comfortableand this one has like a little bit ofelastic which i getbut i almost wish it didn't it's gonnareally drive me crazyit's really comfortable nothing ispressing against me nothing's poking methere are no claspslet's put it to the gravity test crackmy neck even though i can'tokay it's not that bad i think i justneed to size downum okay that's interesting so um so iwould prefera little bit more of a hole for beingthe most expensiveout of the bunch it kind of hurts when ijump i'm not gonna lieit wasn't that bad i would have to saybut my recommendation is definitelysizing downso if i'm normally a large i should havebought the mediumdefinitely not bad support like i thinkyou'll be fine if you're just doing yournono hurts it hurts are they just tenderbecause my periods coming noit hurts there's support i think it'sit's a true smalli think it gives you enough support thatif you wanted to work outor work outyou would be fine and comfortable but ijust don't know about thisfabric and these seams it seems a littlechafey it is the first bra that i triedonduring this episode that has kind ofadjusted to the current state of my bodyyou can tell it's a little bit tighter idefinitely don't feel likeanything's busting out i feel reallycomfortable and i feel reallyconfident in this mentally andphysically other than notgiving support which i guess is thepurpose of a sports problem it fitsreally well like i think it's reallytrue to sizefor 52 though i don't really feel likethis is worth it because it doesn'treallygive you much support so like why whywhy whywhy with regards to the size i do thinkif you typically wear a small this wouldwork for you i like the designthe style the cut i think the fabriccould be a lot betteri'm actually really shocked that ididn't love this one yeah i think thisis true to size itstill fits me perfectly and nicely andcomfortably i don't want to take it offi'm not gonna take it off in facti know it specifically says mediumsupport so i definitely think i neededto size down i think a large is too bigfor me i wish it had a little bit moresupport because at the end of the dayrunning when you have double d's it getsall over the placebecause the price and because lululemonis supposed to kind of like reignsupremeshe's kind of like the queen bee ofsportswear she's not doing what she'ssupposed to do and the other ones did sogo the living girl what's upokie dokie i'm in my favorite which isno surprisethe gym shark bra but i also have thelululemon bra on my hair blue womencomes in a close second i really likethe colorand the straps in the back are reallycute i'm more of an aesthetic girl thana comfort girlit is what it is my favorite bra ishands downthe amazon sports bra this particularbrais incredible it's affordable it fits mereally well and it alsohas

hello it's christy from christy sewscool stuff[Music]i am here in my yoga clothing lookinglike a mess and you probably wonder whyi have this shirt i got it when i waspregnant with my sonit was my special treat to myself forprenatal yogaand it no longer fits me because i am nolonger pregnantso i'm going to show you how to do asimple shoulder alterationby shortening this is a good techniqueif you like to go to thrift shopsor if something's on sale and they don'thave your sizeand you just want it it's good to knowhow to do this and also sometimesif you have a really popular size youmight have to go up depending onthe assortment at the store and whileyou can't necessarily make somethingsmaller biggeryou can really easily make somethingthat's too long and the shoulders fitright i don't want to get rid of thisshirt it's blue lemonit's gray most of my workout clothing isblack so i like having some gray andsome colori'm not getting rid of this top it's notgoing to happenso here is the same alteration in adifferent shirtit is not the right size for me thatmeans that the straps were super longand then even as i wore it they gotlonger and longerso i got annoyed one day and i just didthis really fast this is just a searchedgeit's a super casual shirt it doesn'thave a finished edge likeif i were to make thisi would go like that and it would benicer and i would never in that casedo this but my hair hits right therenever see it whateverso here is the shirt and here'severything that you needto work on it so these areneedles for stretch fabricyou can't use a universal needle i don'thave this exactsewing machine so this sewing machine isa specialty sewing machine forthis clothing it has two needles thatrun parallel to each otherand then a zigzag thread that catchesthemand then underneath the another zigzaggoes like this so when you're sewingthere'stwo needles going like this and twoneedles going like thisand um yeah i definitely don't have thatmachine it's thousands and thousands ofdollars and ido not make yoga clothing for a livingand so here's the thread i got this issomething else you needbest practice get thread that matchesif you're at the store unravel and layit on thereand it should pretty much disappearthis is a little bit too light and thatis because i was shopping onlineand ordering to the car another thingyou needis this some kind of marking utensili use taylor's chalk not exactly likewhat you would buy at joann'sso these are my thread scissors they'rereally good forcutting threads off the machine ihave them on a necklace so that when

20-something perfect fitness modelgirls on Instagram I mean moms like meand maybe you if you wanna learn andwatch this video and by the end you'regoing to know just what to look for andwhat to avoid at all costs I promise andfor the best fitness and lifestyle tipsplease subscribe below and remember tohit the alarm bell so that you getnotified every time I put up new videoslike this that help you figure out somecool life hacks for mom so I'm some workout some fitness tips nutrition tips andall sorts of stuff in between okay tipnumber one you have to look at the seamsthe seams are so key so depending onyour build you're gonna want a wider ormore narrow waistband I think mostflattering is a higher waist and youwant to see if there's a front seam anda back seam and these are reallyimportant the back seam is your bestfriend because it's going to give yousome separation back there which reallyhelps give you a flattering look and thefront seam sometimes it's essential whenyou have the back seen that would makesense but that isn't always the case soI have one pair I'll show you guys thathave a back seen but no front seam thatis like genius the front seams sometimescan give you you know your beloved cameltoe situation nobody really wants butsometimes it's worth the price ofadmission for the effect in the back sothat's tip number one these are my veryfavorite black leggings there from Spanxit's like the only thing I have fromSpanx because I hate compression stuffit makes me crazy and I don't think itlooks good on me but these are likeamazingwinter tight because they're prettythick but I have been known to wear themin the summer with like heels and alittle top because they're suck you forgoing outthey are that holy grail where they havethe back seam and a little contour herebut no friends seem very tough to dovery cool super long mine are let's seean extra small and these also hold upvery well they're beautiful with theirgreat example of why seams really matterbecause this might give you the benefitof bothyes seam in the back no seam in frontokay tip number two compression isn'talways your friend so especially if youmaybe have a couple towns you'd like tolose or you are just kind of a biggerframe you're going to assume that highcompression is what you want that isn'talways the case and I for instancereally don't like compression there'sjust sort of the sweet spot of lightcompression that I think looks good onme but just bear that in mind whenyou're looking at them look at thisspandex percentage and just feel themlike pull on them and feel if they aregoing to really squash you in becausesometimes that kind of for me it makesme have like no but at all which is notthe look I'm going forit's all pretty hard-earned for my creamso think about the compression levelokay don't assume you're gonna love itif it's super tight and it's gonna justsuck you in that might be what you wantbut it isn't necessarily the mostflattering nd GTM my very favoritetights ever I would not know about thesetights without a video like this that Iwatched a while back so hence my passionfor legging hauls these are incrediblethey are exactly right from my body theyhave a compressive high waistband andthen they have a very low compressionleg with beautiful detailing it's kindof tone on tone so it's not tooobnoxious and these are like a forestgreen which I never would have boughtbefore but I thinklike really pretty on they have theirsignature foodie contour and a lot ofextra fabric here because you'resupposed to hike them up girlsdefinitely in the back and if you're notdoing it just know pretty much everybodyelse is so just do it and then you knowfix the front up a little bit and justgo with it because it looks I think it'sso good in the back okay for tip numberthree it doesn't have to be black I knowthat's most people save spot but Ireally think that lighter coloredleggings are more flattering especiallyif you're kind of an athletic or curviergirl because you want to highlight yourshape you don't just want it all toblend in and look like nothing youreally want to show all that hard workor show like your god-given gifts butdon't hide them away so be open-mindedabout color scheme and I'll show you awhole range but I personally preferlight colored leggings I think they justthey just look best can't do a legginghaul without something sharp becausethey're so awesome these are theirseamless align no these are their vitalsseamless and I got this kind of heathergray which I think counts as a lightcolor they have very cool detailing theyhave no front seam they're seamless andin the back they don't have a scene butthey have kind of like a pressed Ridgewhich is like a like a shadow of a seambut it helps it definitely helps giveyou some separation they have the selfbootie contouring here very subtle inthis model and some cool atom detaildown the legs love these the brand newis really small they're amazing and allthe tights are tried on today our squatproof by the way even though I didn'treally talk about that as one of my tipsbut I'm just thinking about like overalllook of your leggings these are amazingokay tip number four you want to againassess the height of the waistband sosometimes it can look really pretty tohave a very wide waistband and someI can kind of cut you off I'm a reallyshort torso so I need to go high-waistedbut then the way that I pair it with thetop really matters because it can makeme look like I have no waist like it'slike boobs and hips and nothing inbetween so think about the waistbandthink about whether or not you want tobe able to roll it down think about ifit cuts into you that's never great andjust kind of feel it because a lot ofthese sites have a different compressionaround the waist which I love and I'llget into you really want to be thinkingabout how it's gonna look through yourmiddle versus how it's gonna lookthrough your legs so you might want tohire compression in the middle of theday so for instance on these Lululemonaligns the seam is kind of see how it'skind of contoured down very subtle thisis a great kind of starter contour seambut they have a back seam and a frontseam the back seam is awesome reallyhelpful and the front seam can get youin a little bit of trouble but not toobad on these so these are you know someof my most beloved tights and they havea million beautiful colors they're veryexpensive but they last and you justdon't want to like beat them up too muchbecause they're a little bit fragile butif you take good care of them in thelast two a very long time and you'llkeep pulling them again and again andagain okay the last tip tip number fiveis to look at the detailing some typesnowadays have really cool contouringfeatures that may look scary but reallycan make all the difference in youlooking amazing in your tights so I likelike a subtle bootie contours sometimesif I'm feeling it I'll go for like abooty scrunch I know it's scary and thenthey have like you know sometimes havedetailing down to the legs the kind ofreally highlight if you have muscularlegs like me you can make you can kindof show them off you know you don't haveto put them in black tights and justpretend they're not there like youlike hey look at these legs now we havethe out philippe halo leggings I didHolland nieces well these are also alight color as I said these have a verycompressive waistband these are probablyhigher compression for me but they havelots of fun details and a lot of likemesh paneling see and they have bootycontour that is not see-through thankGod you can see there the patternchanges and they have like an e panelbut they just look really cool on andthey they're highlighting your sort ofmuscles beautifully and they are abeautiful blue trying them I am a formerfitness model many years ago I carriedfor baby as I have three live births andyou know I've gone up

excitedyou're here today with usthank you lauren and it's a realpleasure to be here with all of you andspeak to this audience for the charlottemuseum of history which isgreat to see the public history outreachthat your institution is doingso um i'm going to share my screen nowandall right so okay is that all okay giveme a thumbs up lauren if that looks okayto you okay greatwe're good um so i'm gonna spendmy time today talking a little bit aboutjust a really brief history ofchinese-americanrestaurants in the united states i'malso going to talk about migrationpatterns and i'm also going to betalking aboutsort of the recent anti-asiananti-asian i don't know incidents thathave happenedand their relationship to chinese foodso i'm going to begin though by askingall of you a pollquestion so lauren or angel if you canshare the poll with everyoneso the first question is have youordered from a chinese restaurant sincethe start of the pandemic you can justmark yes or noand if you have ordered from a chineserestaurant since the start of thepandemic how many timeshave you done so so we'll give a fewmoments for everyone to answerall right is there i don't ilauren can you reveal the resultsokay yes wonderful everyone in ouraudience today has actually alreadyordered from a chinese restaurant sincethe start of the pandemicmany of you have ordered many many timesfrom a chinese restaurant over the pastyearand about a quarter it looks like uhhave ordered one or two times inabout a third three to five times that'sgreatso that gives us some context forthinking about today's discussionso i'd like to start today'stalk by showing you this slide this wasa page from a 1880 census given to me bya colleagueand she gave it to me because of theremarkablenote as you can see north carolina inthisparticular survey this 1880 sentencehad one quote-unquote asiatic in 1880it's amazing that this person evenregistered on the censusat all but um i just think that's areally interestingconcept to think about our startingplace 1880 one asiatic and i can't tellyou anything more about who this personwas orwhat nationality they actually were evenat the time if you compare that nowwith this slide which is the percentageof chinese populationby u.s state the top map is actuallyfrom 1870 and the bottom map is from themost recent census in 2010as and as you can see kind of the highconcentration ofchinese living in the united states inthe latter part of the 19th centuryhas basically been spread out across theunited states so now there's sort of amore even distributionof chinese all over the u.s umranging you know the pop the percentageof the population ranges a little bitbut here in north carolina and this datais from north carolina asian americanstogetherwhat's really interesting is that asianamericans as a grouphave grown tremendously in northcarolina from2000 to 2010 the populationasian american population in northcarolina grew by 85 percentwhich was really the third fastest rateof growth of asian americansof any state in the country which isreally quite remarkableum there are over three hundred thousandasian americansuh living in north carolina today that'sabout three percent of north carolina'spopulationand obviously growing mecklenburg countywhere charlotte ishas about 61 000 asian americanresidents i don't have any specific dataon chinese american populationspecificallybut the breakdown of asian americanpopulation in north carolinais actually one-quarter indian or southasianum and then 15 chinese 12 vietnamese and12filipino and then all the other asiannationalities would be somepercentage less than that so i justthought that was interesting to give youguys a sense ofhow chinese have um you knowsort of been part of this state forfor quite a number of years soone of the things that you know isinteresting to think aboutwhen thinking about chinese restaurantsandpeople who work in them is that if i hadforgotten to ask in the poll questionhow many of you have eaten at a chineserestaurant every one of you has eaten ata chinese restaurantin the last year or i've not gottentakeout or somethingbut if i were to ask you do you knowwhere the people who work in thatrestaurantcome from that would be an interestingquestion to ask and i haven't got a pollquestion for thatbut if you know which part of the worldthey come fromkudos to you most people probably don'tor would guess probably chinabut what i want to talk about today isthe variety and the rangeof different places that people who ownand have been involved in the chineserestaurant industry in the united stateshave come from because it has variedquite dramaticallyand i really want to present to you asense of the people behind the platethe people behind the food served inchinese restaurants in this countryas lauren was suggesting earlierin the early part or the latter half ofthe 19th century in the early part ofthe 20th centurymost almost all chinese migrants a veryhuge percentage of themcame from one province and morespecificallya huge percentage of those migrants camefrom one countyin guangdong province which is anamazing statisticright so most of those people came fromthe south of china they spoke cantoneseand you know popular dishes that becamepopular amongst american audiences suchas chop sueywere sort of bastardized forms of alocalvery localized cantonese dishes which isjust ayou know random thing stir-fry togetherwith a gravyum but what i want to share with you isthe sense thatthe the waves of chinese migrants thathave come to the stateshas dramatically changed over the courseof the pastcentury um so from the earlyyou know late 19th and early 20thcentury most of the migrants came fromuh guangdong or canton so if you wentinto a chinese restaurant a hundredyears agomost likely those people would speakcantonese not mandarinwhich is what they speak in beijing andyou know throughout most ofchina as a standard national dialect butcantonese which is what people from hongkong speak and people from guangdongprovincenow that changes and shifts quitedramaticallyin the post-war period from the 1960sonwardas we have almost all the migrantscoming from taiwan hong kong andsingapore placesoutside of mainland china proper now whydid this shift happenbecause um when china the people'srepublic of china was established in1949very quickly the country sort of closeditselfto outward migration so people in chinaweren't reallyleaving china in the post-war periodduring the maoist periodhowever on the contrary um in the unitedstatesthere was a reform of the immigrationand naturalizationact in 1965 which basically opened upmigration to the united states from manymany more places around the worldbesides europeincluding asia including africaincluding the americasand so the migration chinese migrationthat happened in the to the unitedstates in the 1960s and 70sand even through the 1980s largely camefrom taiwanhong kong or singapore so at that pointif you had gone to achinese restaurant in the 1980s forexample or the 1970sprobably the proprietors would be fromhong kong or taiwan or singapore rightone of those but sometimes malaysia evenbut they would not have come frommainland chinaright there would be some legacy ownersof older chinese restaurants who werecantonese who'dwho had migrated here in the earlierpart of the 20th century butreally the new chinese migrants of the60s and 70swere from these non-mainland chineseplacesnow that changes again when we get tothe late 1980swhen with economic reforms in mainlandchinachina once again opens opens itself upand people are allowed to migrate out ofchinaand what we see from the 1980s 1990sonwardis a tremendous shift in the peopleinvolved in the chinese restaurantindustry in the united statesand from that point on most of thepeople or many many many of the peoplewho own chinese restaurantsand work in chinese restaurants comefrom the single province of fujianagain this isn't true of everyone butit's true of a lot of different chineserestaurant toursand so dollars to donuts you know if thenext time you go to youruh chinese takeout place ask the peoplewho work there what part of chinaor what part of the world they come fromthey might not come from china at allthey may come from malaysia they maycome from india they may come from youknow singapore or taiwanso just a really interesting exercise inworld geography to learna little bit more about where and ifthey come from china where in china dothey come fromto learn more about the people that areserving you the food or making the foodfor youum so as a kind of an exampleof this pattern i wanted to show thisslide this is awebsite for my class portfolio i teach aclass at uncon chinese food history the culturalhistory of chinese foodand one of the projects that i have mystudents do is i have theminterview a chinese restaurateur innorth carolinaand um it's a fantasticproject the students go all out andthey've done these fantastickind of in-depth profiles of the peoplewho bring chinese food to your platebasicallyand i wanted to point out some of theonesin the charlotte area that people haveuh prosome of my students have profiled lastspringum my student interviewed john you fromthe taste of suein charlotte and it's a fairly recentrestaurantbut it really specializes in sichuanesecuisineshu is a kind of a historical name forthe area of sichuanand interestingly enough though johnhimself is fujianiso he's from a totally differentprovince but you know sis chinese foodis really popular in the united states alot of americans recognize the chinesefood and know it's spicythey probably don't know anything aboutfujini's food so it's very rare that youwould seea fujinis restaurant even though many ofthe people running them are from theprovince of fujianother students uh profiled the owner ofcottage express a takeout place inin charlotte and julian there he's alsoa fujinese migrantand another student umanother student interviewed the owner ofsoho bistrowho is from guangdong province againshowing that very regionalizedorigins of many of the chineserestaurant owners in the united statesand yen lin is uh you know cantonese andshe says that the restaurant is sort ofcantonese and inspiration soum i i don't know the restaurants myselfi've not been to charlotte in a whileespecially not recentlybut i just thought it would beinteresting for all of you who live incharlotteto know where some of the chineserestaurant toursin your local city have come from andagain i encourage you to strike up aconversation the next time you go toyour favoriteum chinese restaurant and just ask themwhere what part of chinaare you from or what part of the worldare you from um because itmight not be what you expect and i andthat's one of the things that thestudentsum you know in this class portfolio oneof the reallydeeply uh powerful things for me as aninstructoris to see the range of experiences thatchinese migrantsto this state have they don't all comefrom china they have a wide variety ofinterests andyou know they they kind of the one thingthat links and like this other picturebelow rasa indie chinese restaurantthe man is a third generation indianchinese so his grandfatherfirst went to india and then eventuallyhe and his wife who is indianemigrated to the united states andopened this restaurant in chapel hillwhich serves their own kind of indianindianized chinese food so every placein the worldtheir local chinese cuisine is cateringto their locallocal tastes just like chinese americanfood is kind of catering to americanpalates the same is true of chinese foodeverywhere around the worldand it's just a really interestingphenomenon andyou just really can learn a lot aboutthethe wide range of chinese migrants whenyou talk about restaurantsso um unfortunately given the pandemicand given the recent um kind of awfulnews continual news i just read anotherstory about someelderly asian women who were attacked insan francisco because of thisonslaught of news one of the things thati have tried to doduring this pandemic year is to do a lotof public outreach like this talkand to really dispel some of the mythsabout chinese food that haveunfortunately arisen because of thepandemicand i will direct you to this umuh panel that i did last may with someotherscholars of chinese food history who umand it was called rumorsuh what was it called rumor chinesediets and kobit covid19questions and answers about chinese foodand eating habits and if you're reallycurious to know more about the originsofthe coronavirus or what people havelearned and the connection to thethe seafood market in wuhan where youknow for a long time at the beginningwas called the epicenter of thecoronavirus which by the way has notbeen studied or proven yet by scientiststhey don't know what the originis actually of the virus um i direct youto thisparticular video recording of the panelthat we did at that timeanswers can answer a lot more of yourquestions that you might have about thatbut unfortunately with the use of termsby our former president such askung flu and chinese virus there'sobviouslyobviously been a huge uptick inanti-chinese and anti-asian crimesand also just prejudice andmisinformation that's running aroundand this is just an example this shirtwas uhdesigned by a t-shirt designer incaliforniaand it was posted um by the lululemonthat's an athleticleisure wear company art director uhit's just athis bat this this chinese takeout boxwhich says no thank you with bat wingson itkind of alluding to the idea that peoplewere eatingbat fried rice and that's where thiscoronavirus came fromum the art director was subsequentlyfiredafter posting that um but the t-shirtyou can still buy itanywhere online that you want um itwhich is also really unfortunate and soit's a reallyinteresting you know what was reallyinteresting for me to be teaching lastspringwhen the corona virus lockdowns werestarting is that the last time i metwith my students in personin my chinese food class they weretelling me about all the racist memesthat they were seeing circulating ontheir social media and on the internetand it's reallyit was saddening to me to hear from themthat their friends were afraid of eatingchinese foodthat people one girl told me that sheknew someone ofan acquaintance who ordered chinese foodand then refused to accept the deliveryand just all manner of like you know asone as oneyoung woman in a new york timesdocumentary said you know thecoronavirus was raging in italy at thesame time as wellbut nobody was shutting down orboycotting olive garden or saying raciststuff about italians so you know there'sobviouslya lot of racial things in thereinterestingly solast spring in april this credit cardcompany wompleyreported that chinese restaurants hadclosed at a much higher ratecompared to other kinds of takeoutrestaurants51 percent of chinese restaurants hadclosed at a high point it was somethingmore like 60 percentversus 19 percent of takeout placesoverallum and so people thought oh this is asign that people are not eating chinesefoodyou know a lot of these restaurants areclosing what is really interestingby the following month however more andmore chinese restaurantshad reopened according to the creditcard data from this credit card companyand their open rate was more like 74whichwas a much closer match for u.srestaurants as a wholeum so that's an indicator that peoplewere closing chinese restaurantstemporarilyand a lot of people were thinking thatit was uh becausemaybe some of these family-runrestaurants they had older peopleyou know grandmothers or grandfathers athome they didn't want to risktheir older family members getting sickso maybe that's why a lot more chineserestaurants closed at the beginningversus now however like every otherrestaurantin the country people are really facingchallenges in the restaurant industryand there's no question thatchinese restaurants have closed at avery high rateand i wanted to show you also thisthis information this is grace youngsome of you may know her if youif you have any chinese cookbooks she'sa very well-known cookbook authorshe wrote stir frying to the sky's edgeand a number of other really wellreceived andcookbooks that have won awards onchinese cooking and soshe has kind of become the face ofsaving new york city's chinatown andshe started with the james beerfoundation this saved chineserestaurantshashtag which encourages people to takea picture of theirthe food from their favorite chineserestaurant and post it to instagramor um uh i guess i don't know if it'stwitter or instagram but anyway that'sthe hashtag save chinese restaurantsshe also has collaborated with somedocumentary filmmakersto make documentaries about the impactof coronavirus on new york city'schinatownand on the different restaurant tours inthe areaso that's under this coronaviruschinatown stories if yougoogle that you'll be able to find andlearn more about some of these reallythese uh restaurants in new york citythat have a super long history they'vebeen there for decadesand some of them are actuallyyou know threatened by imminent closurebecause they simply don't have thecustomers and foot traffic that theyonce didso she's also started this supportchinatown fundwhich supports food distribution toseniors who are living in new york citychinatownand have had you know difficulties goingout or are afraid to go outso they've been doing food distributionsto seniors living theresimilar kinds of umsimilar kinds of programs areare being run in other major chinatownslike san francisco and oaklandso people are really trying to help therestaurants that they love which areneighborhood places that are near anddear to their heartsanother kind of this kind ofhashtag is called take out hateand it's a similar kind of thing whereit says asian restaurants are facingdiscrimination and mass closureshelp them survive by ordering takeouttoday so again encouraging consumersto order take out from their local asianrestaurants and thentake a picture and post it to thatparticular hashtagas a way of encouraging their friends toeat and you knowtaking pictures of the delicious foodthat's available umso i did want to point out some of thoseways that you yourself as a consumer canmake someyou know effort to support thebusinesses that you umpatronize and uh and loveokay so another really interesting thingthat has happened since the start of thepandemic with regard tochinese american restaurants and chineseamerican food is i love thiseffort by this uh chef ownerof this fast casual chain in new yorkcity it's called jeansand lucas sin is like a wunderkind youngasian american chef he's from hong konghe started cooking in his collegedormitoryand people loved what he was making andeventually he started with his friendsthis basically they're trying to make itlike fast food but it's chinese foodum and at the start of the pandemic hecame out with thisdistance dining concept so these aremeals in a bag that people could orderin the new york area and the firstiteration was calledchinese food is good for you and it hadthis wonderfulum you know lions had meatballs andchicken broth and yam and osmanthus andkind of reallyfighting back the negative publicitythat chinese food and chinese people hadgottenby pushing back and saying no actuallythis food is wonderfulthis food is delicious and wouldn't youlike to have that for lunch i know it'skind of dangerous coming to a lunch andlearn if youhaven't actually eaten yet um i alsowanted to show youuh the rest of the distance diningcollaborations that lucas and has donewith other chefsand and it's really just amazing this istheir umi guess lauren you can tell me if youcan't see this but this is their umdistance dining series and you can seethis creolechinese collaboration with the creolechef indian chineseagain indianized versions of chinesefood west africanchinese cantonese and taiwanesethey did a collaboration with korean onkorean foodanother one with vietnamese foodmalaysian chineseand new chinese-american and then herechinese thaichinese japanese and chinese puertoricanand then here's chinese filipino so it'sjusta really wonderful way of talking aboutandsharing with consumers all the differentplaces in the world that chinese peoplehave migrated toand made their local fusion cuisineslike with all in all of these differentplaces and it looks absolutely deliciousto me andi you know often wish i lived in newyork so that i could eat all at all ofthese placesbut um that's one of the another thingthat i wanted to share with all of youand finally the last slide that i wantedto share with all of you is this onethis is a picture that a student of mineusedin one of her kind of onlinepresentationsabout our chinese cookbook that she waswriting about that's anotherassignment i give all of my students todo an analysis of a chinese cookbookand i was just i love this picture it'sfrom a 2007lunar new year celebration in beijingand although i don't know any of thesepeople personallyi feel like i know this feeling and thisthis this celebration of foodbecause this is what chinese food meansto me as a second generation chineseamericani always associate food with family andwith celebrating and with gathering withpeople you loveand you look at all those deliciousthings on the table they're about totuck into some really tasty foodbut this picture to me umwas the meme that i want to share withthe world this pictureto me talks about what chinese foodmeansfor so many people it's not about badfried rice it's not about these racistmemesi want to push back against those ideasof chinese foodbeing dangerous or chinese peoplesomehow you know harboring thecoronavirus more than anyone elseum with a picture like this a pictureabout familya picture about food a picture aboutcoming together and celebratingand i want to encourage all of you tothink about the people behind the platethe next time you order chinese foodfrom a chinese restaurantit's not just the food on the table thatwe look at in this picture but it'severyone that's partaking in thateveryone that's had a hand in makingthat food and so that's kind of themessage that i want to share witheveryone todaythank you very muchthank you for sharing so much of yourown story with usas well as so much about kind of theworld that we'rewe're living in right now um and i knowhere in charlotte one of the things thatwe at the museumreally loved watching was the communitycoming together tosupport our charlotte restaurants duringthe last year i know everyone at themuseum all of our employees we've allordered from different restaurants we'veallum watched watched the lines around thedooraround the block for some of theserestaurants that people realized justhow important thesespaces are and these spaces forconversationand i know you've talked a little bitabout about this but i think there isthis sort of impetus to over generalizewhen it comes to food types um sothere's the generic italian food orhispanic food and it kind ofloses some of those nuances so i knowyou've talked a little bit about theseregional differencesum but would you mind telling us alittle bit more about those hallmarkssure um let me share this slide with youlet's see umso yeah there some people say if you goon the internet you knowpeople who are real foodies or whateverwill frequently saythere's no such thing as chinese foodyou know every kind offood in china is so regionalized andit's so distinct distinct and differentfrequently people who know much aboutchinese food will talk about the quoteunquote eight major regional cuisineswhich i've circled here on this mapand those are just eight very well-knownum regional cuisines that sometimespeople in the united states have heardof like sichuanese or hunani's food orcantonese foodbut sometimes they haven't heard of likejajang food or jiangsu food or fujinisfoodor shandong food um actually more andmore places are hearing about northernchinese cuisinewith like noodles and bunsand you know there's just ever since the1960s whenmore people from china came to theunited statesand americans grew more aware ofregional distinctions in chinese foodthere's been ever more awareness on thepart of americans of different kinds ofregional chinese cuisines soyou know they eat buns and noodles inthe north and rice in the southyou know the food is spicy in sichuanand hunan thefood is quite delicate and sweet maybecantonese foodor a lot of seafood and lighter sweetertastes in jiangsu and jajang which youcan see around the coastso you know you could spend yourlifetime eating chinese food and nevereat your way to the end of the tablelike there's just so much of it and it'sso differentso i often say you know if anyone says idon't like chinese food i'm thinkinghow on earth is that possible because ibet you i can find you something youwill love to eatbecause it's there's so much of it it'sall so differentand there's so many tastes uhrepresentedeven amongst these foods that you know iwould beflabbergasted if anyone could say thatthey couldn't find anything they likedthat came came from chinese cuisine ialso want to point out to you with thismap thatthere's a lot of things that we don'tthink of when we think ofchinese food and it's an open questionwhether it should be considered aschinese foodfor example there's a number of placesnowin bigger urban areas that serve uhuyghur food or xinjiang foodthis is um turkic muslims who live inthenorthwest part of china and obviouslythere's also a lot of political umyou know kind of complications happeningright now with xinjiangbut um you know most americans wouldn'tthink of xinjiang food as chinese foodor tibetan food as chinese foodand and that's fine like that's theinteresting thing about china it's justso diverse in terms of its geography interms of its ethnicitiesum and in terms of its food it justmakes it a really interesting place tostudy soyou know you again you could spend alifetime learningchinese about chinese food and you'dnever eat it all that's the great thingabout ityeah i think one of the things that whenit comes touh to talking about food it's thechanges that happenas people move from place to place it'sas people interact with with others umwe know especially in charlotte andearly charlottewe really see the development of foodchange as more people end up in thisregionyou see the mixing of a number ofdifferent traditions that all cometogether to create something uniquelysouthernum it's west african it's catawba it'seuropean-based it's all of thesedifferent thingsthat come together and one of the thingsespecially we see herein the united states is there are somany people coming here and so manypeople that are interacting and creatingthesenew really cool dishes um butwhat is kind of the main differencebetween chinese foodfrom china and obviously there's a lotthat goes into that a lot of differentdifferent styles and that we've justcovered herebut what do you see as some of the maindifferences betweenfood from china itself versus food thatwe see in the united stateswell it's interesting because you know alot of mystudents they come in and they you knowwhen they come into my food historyclassthey all have a bee in their bonnetabout authentic food you know this placeis authentic this place is not authenticyou know blah blah which is basicallyhow close is it to what my perception ofwhat chinese food based onmaybe what they ate at home or maybe ifthey traveled to china or taiwan andthey once had beforebut i really want people to get awayfrom thinking aboutauthenticity is kind of thebe-all-end-all measure ofchinese restaurants because frankly youknow when my students go out and talk toall the different chinese restaurateursthat they talk to in north carolinawhat they discover is people have had toadapt in order to survive right theyserve the food that people will eatand as i mentioned before in every placein the globepeople chinese migrants have gone thereand adapted their cuisineto fit local tastes that's just becausethat's what you do in order to surviveand so for example in france they servechinese food in courses and you have asoup courseand then you have your dish and then youhave your dessert you know becausethat's the way a french person might beused to eating french food soum you know it isn't served family styleor not always it's often like a you knowa kind of what do they call prefix menuwhere you have specific things served toyouand so um so what uh what you do onceyou think about thatis like you can get away from the ideaof is this authenticis this and not authentic it's just doyou like it or don't you like it youknow does it taste good to you ordoesn't it taste good to youi think there is definitely adistinction between the kinds of foodsthat people eatin china versus the kinds of chineseamericanized foodsthat are served here in restaurants hereyou know often people say it's a lotsweeteryou know people don't have as aquote-unquote adventurous palette so youwill onlysee the recognizable meats of beefchickenyou know pork you won't see other cutsyou won't seedifferent parts like chicken feet orpigs trotters or somethingwhich might be very very popular youwon't see things with different texturesand smells seafood like um one of mystudents interviewed a chineserestaurateur who lives on the coastand he said i tried to offer seafood itried tobring in fresh seafood and nobody wouldorder it you know americans just won'teat fish that has bones in it they won'tyou knowso a lot of times it's a really a slowchange and in education of palletsso you see much more deep fried stuffhereor heavier sauces you know but again alotin a lot of different places people'spalates are changingthey're ready to take on spicier foodsthey're ready to tackleyou know kind of really um localspecialties especially in a mecca likenew yorkyou know there's all kinds of placesthat are specializing inshandong noodles or xi'an you know umchampion or some like stuffed stuffed uhkind of bun things um pancake things umyeah so there's just a lot of um sorryfor lauren i forgot your originalquestion butbasically just to say that um yeah don'tthink about food as authentic orinauthentic just think do i like it ordon't i like it andit's okay for you to change your mindit's okay for your palate to grow and iencourage always people totry new things like i do with my kidsyou know always take a bite and see ifyou like itbecause you might be surprised and umand the beauty of chinese food is thatit can encompass this range it's soversatile it's so adaptablethat it can encompass this huge range ofyou know the kinds of foods people eatin china which are changing by the wayall the timeyou know people love food fads and newkinds of foodsum and and you know people are embracingthings like organicand you know farm to table and that kindof thing that areyou know big things here that alsochanges the way people eat in china soum yeah those would be some of thegeneral distinctions between chineseamericanfood served in your average takeoutplace which can be really tasty you knowit's not doesn't always have to bewhateverfancy thing so i just really encouragepeople to step away from thinking aboutauthenticity and think more justdo you like it or not and think aboutthe reasons why this particular food isbeing served and it's mostly because ofeconomic survivaland i think there is in food history ingeneral we see that people want thingsto be static and unchanging and that'sjustthat's not what food history is that'snot what the consumptionof food is it's about change as youencounter new ideasas things develop and grow asingredients become availableas new technologies for cooking becomeavailablewe see that all the time with 18thcentury cooking there is a bigdifference between things that arehappeningin the 1750s versus things that arehappening in the 1800s becausethere's just so much more available andout there and so much more communicationum and so i think seeing that in chinesefood as wellis speaks to this broader story umit's really interesting you mentionedthat i just um was hosting a conferenceon modern chinese food ways for scholarsand um one of the things that peopletalked about washow the chili pepper basically socentral a taste the spicy taste ofsituanis and hunani's cuisineis very very late in chinese dietsbecauseit only came to china in like the 1600swith thearrival of crops from the new worldright like sweet potatoes and maize anda bunch of other things thatyou know but but the chili peppers socentral tothe idea of sustained cuisine to thinkgee that's a really pretty latearrival you know chinese cuisine hasbeen dramatically changed by some ofthese arrivals from umyou know other parts of the worlddifferent ingredients and differenttastes and flavors and stuff soyou know any sustained person todaywould be like of course we have chilipeppers butanyone living in sichuan in 1500 wouldnot have had chili peppers and would notknow what you were talking aboutso you know the tastes change reallydramatically and onour concepts of what that food is and atthe same conferenceanother participant talked about a foodrobotthat she saw in shenzhen shenzhen is thecityright across the border from hong kongso it's very modernizedit's where tons of sneakers exported tothe us are madeyou know tons of other stuff sent to theus is made and shewas visiting a friend in shenzhen andthey basically have a little robotthat you buy a packet like it's like akeurig packet where it's like coveredwith plasticall the ingredients are inside you shoveit into this machineand then it cooks the food for you andthen it comes out i mean it's totalnovelty it's totallyyou know so talk about modern andfuturistic you know it's like thejetsons or something like thatand it's just really really interestingto think aboutthe expanse of chinese food as both thisvery ancient tradition in some ways andthen totally modern and totally like youwere saying the technologieschanged the way we um eat and consumefood andjust like here in china during thepandemic there's been a huge shiftto food delivery drone deliveryyou know like ordering food and you knownot so muchgoing outside and maybe not so much thetraditional way of sharing a platefamily styleyou know so these are you knowcontemporary thingsdramatically affect how people eat aswellhistory is being made right now andit'll be interesting to seewhat happens with that story as we moveforwardi think people it's strange to know thatyou're living through history you'reliving through a moment that historiansare going to sit and we're going toanalyzeum for decades and centuries to comewhat this moment meant um and i knowyou've kind of alluded to this a littlebitum but so you're in chapel hill we'rehere i'm here in charlotte um and we'vegot people joining us from a lot ofdifferent places andeach each region each space in theunited stateshas its own story to tell as a part ofthis um and this is athis is a loaded question i know becauseit's a complicated question but what doyou see specific to north carolinaum when it comes to chinese food i meani know i want to hear that it's gotsouthern infusion to it or somethinglike that but i idon't know well one of there's a reallyinterestingum i think it's probably on the umsouthern food ways alliance if i'm notmistaken website butwe had a we have a wonderful um personwho was working in our um in oursouthern oral history program hereum sarah whose last name is escaping meright nowbut she was a documentarian for thesouthern food ways allianceand she made a little documentary ashort documentary shortabout this um african-american chinesekind of specialty dish that was oftenin it was both in louisianain the kind of delta region there andthen also some ineastern parts of virginia and maybe intothe carolinas a little bitbut it was because um a lot of chineserestaurant tours inyou know earlier decades or the 30s or40s whateverwould open chinese restaurants to serveafrican-american communitiesand these were places where otherrestaurateurs would not open whiterestaurants wouldn't open ordidn't want to or whatever and so therewere certain kinds of dishesthat were developed and catered toafrican-american tastes oryou know they it was called what was itcalled yaksyak soba yank or yak i can't rememberwhat it isbut it's basically a specialized noodledish that umis just noodles and then you just couldput different stuff on topbut it wasn't a dish that you would findat any other kind of chinese restaurantoutside of these african-american areaswitha lot of african-american customers andit was something that was really specialto those people and thatyou know like their their kids wouldcome and have it when they'd come homeandyou know it would be a tradition andunfortunately a lot of thoserestaurants are dying out just because alot ofchinese restaurant tours once their kidsare grown uptheir kids often don't want to go intothe restaurant industryyou know i have had a number of studentsat uncwhose parents own a chinese restaurantwho you knowby government by gosh they're not goingto go back to the chineserestaurant you know they don't want tobecause it's like a ton of workit's a lot of hard labor and a lot ofthem never get a vacationand work like practically 365 days ayearand their dream is for their child toget a college education to not have towork in a chinese restaurantwith better english and with betteropportunities and you know all of thesethings soit's really interesting because i thinkumyou will see or you already are seeing aproliferation of different kinds ofasian restaurantsand different kinds of ethnicrestaurants in generalas newer migrants come to the unitedstates and establishthemselves and often have to do sothrough restaurants becauseit's something you can do you know soit's interesting because the percentageof chinese restaurants in the unitedstateswill probably decline just as a resultof this natural kind ofum i don't know what you call itgenerational shiftin uh who is owning chinese restaurantssoyeah it's just a lot of interestingtrends that you can kind ofsee through the restaurant industryand i think for so many even if you'renot in the restaurant industryit's there's memory that's tied to theseexperiences i know we've had a lot ofpeople in the chat that are talkingabouttheir memories of going with family tochinese restaurants to sitting there toenjoying the food and the conversationand i think that's somethingthat just transcends differentdifferent cultures different lifeexperiences we all want to feel thatconnection we all want to feel thatfamily and we all want to feel that kindofjoy that comes from being together and ithink this past year really has shown usjust how much we like being together aswe've had to be a part i mean i know iabsolutely adore my familyand the like but it's been very strangethis year to not be able to see themum and to kind of experience lifethrough a computer cameraand experience life through takeoutrather than being physically in thespaceum and so that's going to be it's goingto be interesting to see those trendsnot only justin experience and restaurants but alsothe the restaurants themselvesand i know we're coming up on time hereand we've just so enjoyed having thisconversation i always like to giveour speakers that kind of last word it'sthat that moment for as one of ourvolunteers says dazzle usuh with brilliance so what do you reallyhope that people take away fromthis conversation today how can peoplesupport this communityum and what what's so important aboutchinese food that you really want peopleto walk away withyeah i think um i think one of thethings is just to sayif you love the food go eat it and youknow especially in this time of thepandemic support any of the restaurantsthat you reallyenjoy and care about because i know it'sbeen a real struggle for a lot ofdifferent peopleand if you care about the restaurant andyou care about the people that worktherethen the best thing you can do issupport them by by going toto patronize it um and i was justthinking as you were talking you knowabout the connections we make throughfoodyou know one of the ways that i keep intouch with my relatives or my parentswe text each other pictures of food thatwe've made so you know my mom made somevegetarian buns and she sent them to meormy dad made some special kind of i can'tremember it was like apork tenderloin soup or something likethat and my cousin wrapped dumplings andit's just a way of um you know becausewe can't as you said we couldn't eattogether this yearbut we still could share our lovethrough food and throughour pictures of the food that we made umsoi think and i hope that people will umtake those lessons that they've learnedthis year of being a part in thepandemicand try to carry them forward and andshare more mealswhen it's possible with the people thatthey love because i can't think of abetter wayto you know learn about another cultureor you knowtravel the world through your kitchenbasically i think that's just

things that areworrying you but instead you have thisperfectly clear headspacewhere your mind is free to think as itwantsnow you mention it that does happen yeahwell then perhaps unknowingly you mighthave experiencedrunning as a form of meditation look atyou gobut running such a physical activity andmeditation is soso still you're not wrong but thinkabout it they've both got anawful lot in common they're bothrepetitive practicesand the more you get into the habit ofdoing it the more you get in returnmeditation really helps you to connectwith your body andin turn can help with your runningtraining so why not combine the twogenius so what is running meditationrunning meditation is connecting yourmind with your bodywhich means that you're free fromdistractionand that you're completely present inthe moment this can result in aheightened focusand a feeling of complete relaxationit's often referred toas mindfulness and that flow that weoften hear talked about in other sportsbut how do you reach that state i hearyou asking well we've got10 top tips to help you stay focusedand reach that meditative flow when outon a runrunning meditation and mindfulness isall about freeing yourself fromdistraction so it is best torun alone and at a time that suits youat the start of your runset yourself an intention this could besomething along the lines ofrun in a relaxed rhythm it's somethingthat you can come back to if you feelthat your mind is wanderingto really get that focus back now weknow that running on a treadmill canhave its benefits but in order to reallyexperience the truerelaxing nature of running meditationyou need to stepout your front door get outside andbreathe in that fresh airi know i know music can be so much funwhen out on a run it can get youall psyched up when the going gets toughbut to truly connectyou need to leave those beats behindyou might actually find that you likerunning without any musicplus you get to listen to the sound ofnaturenow this sounds like an obvious one ofcourse you need to breathe but reallyfocuson some deep breaths before you startyour runif your mind starts to wander then bringit backand focus on your breathing try andbreathereally deep down from your diaphragm andif you need any more tipson breathing during your run be sure tocheck out our video on thattry not to stress about your speed it'sbetter to runslow than not go you could even tryrunningnaked and leaving all the tech at homethis wayyou won't be stressing about checkingyour stats as you start easy and focuson your breathingswitch to how your mind is feeling letgoof any stresses from the day and reallyindulgeyourself to take this time for yourselflet any thoughts come and go don't judgethem or try and fight themnow one of my favorite things aboutrunning as meditation is that it canreally help you be present in yoursurroundings you may even notice thingsthat you've not before it may even helpyou to makea mental list of things around you sothat you can engagemore with what's going on listening toyour foot strikecan really help you tune into yourinternal rhythmand stop any distractions coming throughsotry counting the number of times yourleft foothits the ground start with 10 or 20 onceyou get to thatstart again from one not sure thatcounting's for youwell paula radcliffe is a fan ofcounting and shevery famously counts when races aregetting tough she'll count her footstrikesand really bring that focus back soperhaps counting might just be thetraining tip you need we all get theoccasional niggle and annoying stitchor the odd day when things just aren'tclicking do notfret it's an incredible skill to be ableto respond to our bodyaccordingly and then adapt our runningas we dowe are so lucky to be able to getoutside and move and enjoyour hobby every runs there for a reasonwhether it's taking you a step closer toyour goalmaybe it's a run for fun or just arestful recovery rundon't forget to take a moment at the endof your run to say thank youbut can meditative running improve yourrunningoverall for some people yes althoughit's a little bit tricky toprove the improvements come from knowinghow your body and mind can work togetherand also being able to understand yourmind and when it's trying to trick youor when you could perhaps push a littlebit harderi get it so being in tune with your bodycan help you runlonger and stronger exactly some runnershave found that through runningmeditation and checking in with theirbodythey've been able to find a more naturalcadence rather than one that feelsforce and this in turn can make runningfeel easierand more natural with less effortchecking in with your body regularly canalso help improve your form as youbecomemore aware of your positioning and howyour body is movingin turn this can lead to a decrease ininjury as you becomebetter at listening to your body otherbenefits may also includea more peaceful and pleasant run areduction in stressand worry and in some cases even abetter night's sleepso there are lots of potential benefitswith meditative runningbut it can all feel a little bitoverwhelming when you first startwe got in touch with an expert to

[Music]my level of patience has dramaticallyincreased after six years of being astay-at-home parentthe amount of times that you areinterrupted mid-sentencei can go get him i have a feeling hepooped his pants my name is christopherhughesi have two children and i've been astay-at-home dad for six yearsi've been a stay-at-home dad for 13years and i've been staying home dad forapproximately eight yearsi officially became a stay-at-home dadabout three and a half years agothere is a new report out aboutstay-at-home dads two of my good buddiesare stay-at-home dads the workit is tough it's i couldn't do it we'veseen a couple of incredible tremendouschanges in the united states since the1960s and second wave feminism first andforemostwas the dramatic increase in women'spresence in the paid labor force[Music]the other pretty significant change muchmore recently just the last generationis how involved fathers are in childcarewe've seen a significant increase in theshare of hours that fathers spend onhousehold chores and on childcare that said there still is a big gapbetween the amount of time that mothersdevoteso while we've seen a little bit of aclosing of the gap there still is asignificant difference between mothersand fathers and you know part of thechange that we've seen is attributableto the fact that many more mothersare working outside of the home nowmy wife is a physician anda professor at a medical school i couldyou know have two kids during my medicalschool training and residency becauseyou know i had a great support personand who was willing to give up hiscareeri began working in restaurants when iwas 15and then worked until i was 30 before igave up my career to start staying homewith the kidsi was in law school and then weimplicitly decided that it it'll be bestby stay home with our son and shego off and bring home the bacon so tospeak i never made the assumption that iwould stay home the assumption is mywife wouldi loved what i did and i was good at itbuti would never make the money that shedid i had a great opportunity to stay athomei was a police officer detroit and i gothurt on the jobso i was given i guess you would call itlike an early retirementit probably would have cost 60 000 ayear to have somebody watch our kidsbecause of the prices and me not workingfull timewe decided that if i wereto start working part-time that wouldbarely cover the costs of the daycarewe were paying something around fifteenhundred dollars a monthfor child care which was a big chunk ofmy paycheck that i was bringing homeand it did get bothersome to me that iwas working basically to have someoneelse watch my kids[Music]people still say that women should bethe primary caretaker they should be theones who taketime off of work when the new childenters the family and vice versauh public polling data says that men areexpected to be the breadwinnersso there's this sort of tension betweenwhat's going on in the labor force andthe achievements andadvances that women have made but thenthesesocietal attitudes that are kind oflagging some of those trendsmy mom definitely thought that it didnot soundvery ambitious to want to be astay-at-home parenta friend of my wife told her that shecannotever marry a man who's not working wellmy job ishere with me at home when i'm teachinghim in school and when i'mfeeding him and bathing and makes suredoes his homework playing with himjob does not always mean paycheckjob to me means responsibilitythe experience of stay-at-home dadstoday really mirrors the experiences ofstay-at-home moms for generationsthe feelings on one hand of kind ofisolationand alienation from others and thechallenges the themundane repetitive nature of parentingday after day after dayyou want to give all your barbies awayokaythe challenges would be the feeling ofnot being appreciated sometimeslike if you spend a whole day doingsomething and you're so excited likewhen your spouse comes home and you wantthem to like notice that you didsomething or got something doneit that can be tough sometimes becausethe kids definitelydon't at their age don't show muchappreciationone of the biggest struggles that wehave is the isolation and your value andself-worthit is a difficult question to answerbecause you don't havethat external paycheck or that promotionto show you what you're worth to yourfamilythe isolation and just thatsense of being in prison it can take atollwhen you're caring for a little one youcan't have a conversation with himoutside of barbies in the playhouse andeverythingand there's times when you just want totalk to someonei don't believe that i know any otherstay-at-home dadsin person i have friends that arestay-at-home momsthat i can kind of expressour common struggles they're notidenticalstruggles it's really hard because evenlike on some of the facebook groups andstuff it'll be stay at home momsstay-at-home moms stay-at-home momsbut the large majority i would i wouldsend an invite to him and i would iwouldnever hear anything back from himour co-founder matt schneider tried tojoin a localmoms group in his neighborhood and theyvery politely and saidyou seem like a really good guy but theway the rules are for our groupit's too uncomfortable you know a lot ofguys feel isolatedand lonely and we're definitely able tofoster a sense of belonging andcommunity to these guys[Music]we were baby-wearing our little ones atmuseumswe were going for strolls over thebrooklyn bridgeand we were taking parent me classes andjust being surrounded by this reallyactivehands-on community of dads reallyenabled meto embrace my role as an at-home dadi wrote a book called the ultimate stayat home dad your essential manual forbeing a full-time father that comes outoctober 2021and i hope that that book is able tohelp the dads in a way that i didn'thave when ifirst started[Music]if we compare u.s families with those ofcomparable nations in northern europescandinavia in particularwe find that u.s family leave policiesare pretty meager[Music]so in order to foster gender equalityand gender progresswhat the countries did is they passeduse it or lose it policieswhereby men had to take x number ofweeks or monthsof paid family leave otherwise it wouldjust disappearso that policy change really led to acultural shift whereby ithas become more acceptable for men to bestay-at-home dadsif the united states wants to havesimilar changes to ourgendered work family arrangementsdynamicswe need to pass generous paid familyleave policies[Music]we've seen another spike in the numberof stay-at-home dads and momsmany of those dads by force enjoyedspending time with their kids and likeparenting but ultimately they wanted toget backinto the workforce their identity waswrapped up in their workif we compare them with stay-at-homedads who chose to stay at homein agreement with their partnerstypically they were the oneswho were much more comfortable with thisnew situationi still enjoy cooking and i feel that itit definitely strengthensmy ability to be a stay-at-home parentfeeling the kind of accomplishment thatyou doat a career is different than the kindof accomplishments that you feelas a stay-at-home parent because whenyou stay at homeyou look more in the accomplishments ofyour family as a wholei'm in training to be a part-timefirefighter for the city of farmingtonhillsi have the need to be an asset to thefamily more than i already ami feel that i can return to law schoolwhen i feel the time is rightand in the meantime i'm the the fatherthe cook the counselor the nurse ihave all these different hats and allthese different professions as astay-at-home dadlook i can chop wood i can fix cars ican drink whiskey i can write a novel ican do all thatand i can also sew and i can bake and ican give people hugsyou know the misconception that mymasculinity is tiedto my job is a mythsome experts are saying this economicdownturn unfairly targets womenit actually does fall on womendisproportionately at home during thistime periodthe homeschooling the the cooking andthe housework etc the child carewe found that working mothers felt likethey were having to sort of pick up moreof the slack in terms ofthe child care responsibilities whetherthey had kids who wereat home doing school or whether theirdaycare was closedand then we also found that women weremore likely to saythat the challenge of sort of workingand raising kids during covet had hadnegative impacts on their careers thatthey felt that they couldn't give 100at work i think if you're two workingparents right now or a single parentit has got to be some of the mostdifficult time in your life i do not ido not know how you jugglea job and teaching and houseworkall the same time if i do thisprofessionally i'm aprofessional stay-at-home dad and if i'mstrugglingthen my heart goes out to youdo you have to run right into yourappointment yeah actually ihadwhen my wife is working from home andseeing patientsthe kids have definitely either bargedinto the officeand interrupted her calls or banged onthe door and tried to get inand it's definitely challenging for heri would say that staying at home with mychildrenhas aided my wife and her successthroughout her careerin order to pursue everything andaccomplish what she

like that but yeah so and thesize of it for a dollar is amazingand then this basket right here sodollar tree has done this beforein this style but the handle i feel likeis an updated featureprobably has been around the last coupleof months but i still feel likeit's not something that they did like in2019or prior so the fact that they put ahandle on thisis absolutely amazing i have to say thatit feelslike pretty decent quality okay eventhesefeel a little bit stronger than umsome of the other baskets that have likethese larger cutoutswith the larger cutouts it can tend tolike weaken the structureum that's what i've noticed with some ofthe past baskets from dollar tree butthis one seems pretty decentum so anyways the handle is awesome so idon't know maybe if you're gonna dowater

of you have been asking mewhat has happened with your aliexpresscoupons why can't you give us somediscounts soi have actually been reaching out tothis store and asked themif they could give me a discount code inexchange for me doing this reviewso you guys could get some percentageoff sothey agreed to give me a discount codethat is going to be valid for twoweeks but let me know if you do likethisitems if you do like this store and ifyou do like this discount code maybei can ask them to get the code valid forlonger if you do prefer to have it thiscodei will leave down here and i will alsoleave it in the description box downbelow and it will give you six percentdiscount on everything ontheir store so i'm trying to get gooddeals for you so you cansave yourself some money for today'svideo i have two pair of shortsone pair of legging and one pair of onepiecei'm very excited about that one to showyou so let's kick this video offwith the two different pair of shortsthat i am having becausesummertime is just around the corner andi know a lot of you are on the huntfor a good pair of shorts so the firstpair of shorts that i have is thisseamless scrunchy booty shorts and yes iknowthis looks like the ones that i reviewedthe otherday and they are very similar i havethis also in size medium but i will saythat they runsmaller in size so i will definitelyrecommend you to size upin this and in the waist right acrossthe waist we have non-stretched in sizemedium 30 centimeters which is 11.8inchesand you do have a bit of an inner seamso i will call this likebiker shorts and the inner seam is 5inches which is12 12 and a half centimetersthey come with a scrunchie part in theback so this is scrunchy booty and it'sa legit scrunchand the scrunch is stiff so there is nota stretchy scrunchand you also have the contouringunderneathand as you can see this shorts are alittle bit more slimin the legs than what they are in thewaist so i guess that these shorts are alittle more likei will say like chinese sizingum so size medium fits a little bitsmallbut i will say like if you have theproblemthat you are a little bit bigger aroundyour waist i think that this shorts isperfect because if you have like slimmerlegs andwider waist because they are that typeof shape where they are you can see likebigger upper and smaller down herewith that being said let's take a lookhow they are looking on me because i amthe completeopposite i am small around my waist andi have a little bit thicker thighs andthere is no problem for me to use themeither because they area lot of stretch in them as you can seein the try on i can fit themso they go on squat proof and they arecovering cellulitebut i mean they are short so you'regoing to show cellulite on yourthighs but not your booty and super highwaist give compression i meanthese are very similar to the otherscrunchy booty leggings and shorts thati have been reviewing alreadyi will say that they have a lot of timecontrol though so theyare like thicker in the tummy area sothey do give a lot of time compressionif you feel insecure with your tummythen for sure these shorts are doing thedrill for you because they are givingyou a lot of timecontrol i will say like my overallexperience with these shorts is that igive them thumbs upbut i will say do size up because i amin between size small and medium andsize small would definitely have beenway too small for me so definitely sizeup in this if you want to make surethat they are going to fit the otherpair of shorts are very different soit's this type of shorts that hasthe adjustable straps on the sidesuper high waist non seamless anda seamless type of waistband and thisshorts is not having anelastic band in the waist because i knowi've seensimilar variations to this type ofshorts but all of them have been havingelastic bands in the waist and i don'tthink that is asflattering they do not have any scrunchor anything so they are very plain inthe backbut they are doing something nice sincethey have the adjustablethings on the side i have them in sizemedium and this shorts i will say runvery true to sizeso here i will say go for your normalsize and i will also take the measureright across the way 32 centimeterswhich is 12 and a halfinch so very true to size the only thingi can say with this is that theyare like rolling up a little bit i meanyou can adjust thembut when i'm putting up the stripes onthe sides a little biti do get the feeling that they arerolling up but you can of coursehave them folded down and do not take upthe adjustable partin this side and then maybe they willstay down a little bit betterthey have a middle seam but i do nothave any problem with camel toe i thinkit's because i took them in the rightsize my overall experience with theseshorts is prois that they do not have the elasticband in the waist parti also saw that they had matching sportsbras like matching top to this crop topsbut i didn't see it when i ordered but isaw it after when i went into thewebsite again i saw that they had itum and i would love to have this withmatching topbut i think that this short is also verycute to match withother tops the only downside is thatthey are rolling up a little bit in mythighs otherwise i give them thumbs up ithink that they are very niceand i think that they are very unique ihaven't seen so many other stores havingthis on aliexpress soi i like that i mean it's a good pair ofshorts and i like that you can adjustthe lengthin the legs so you can have it a littlemore biker and longer if you want to andyou can definitely have them shorter ifyou want to also soi give them thumbs up i think that theyare pretty it's a good pair of shortsthen let's talk about this one pieceokay so now i've been reviewing what wasthat little songso now i've been reviewing two onepieces here on my channel injust a matter of months but this oneis a seamless one piece withthis scrunchy booty leggings part likethisscrunchy booty same as the shorts that ijust talked aboutso i can say like this one piece is likethe scrunchy booty marl high waistleggings anda top had a baby i have a little bit ofmixed feelings here sothe first mixed feeling that i have isthat it has a pocket herehonestly i mean i like the idea ofhaving pockets on seamless items but idon't know if i like the pocket on thisone piece i think i would have preferredto not have the pocket on this one piecebut that is like the only thing i thinkif i could adjust something i would takeout the pocketsotherwise this one actually is gorgeousi meani have this in size mediumand i mean it fits me likeperfectly it hugs my waist it gives thescrunchy booty partit gives like a booty lift uh i do notneed to wear a bra it comes withpaddings also so it's like a sports brabuilt in in thisthat i will say give a mediumcompression so it's kind of acompressive sports braso this is definitely like a one pieceand you don't need anythingelse underneath maybe underwear if youwant to butotherwise you don't need any bra oranything you are definitely tugged insizing wise i will say they run true tosize i was honestlya little bit scared if i needed to gofor a size largesize medium is fitting me perfectly andi think it is also because it's thistype of seamless it's not giving anychemical or anythinglong enough in the legs i mean you candecide for yourself by looking atthe footage when i'm wearing it but imean i think that it'svery pretty and yeah it's only thepocket that if i could adjust somethingi will take away the pocketbut it's squat proof and it's it givescompressionbut it's not super tight around my coreso i cannot work out in it it'sdefinitelylike i like it it's fitting me perfectit's fitting me niceand it's a fun addition to my collectionbecause i do not have any one pieceslike thisand i really like that they had thescrunchy part in the back and that it'snotleaving me too much cleavage too much ofanything it'sperfectly tugged in but still very funadditionso if you are on the hunt for one pieceand you love the scrunchy bootytype of leggings you're gonna love thisone piece and go for your normal sizethere's no need to slice up or down inthis and they have it in more colorsalso soi will give it thumbs up but thumbs downfor the pocket so last we have thispocket leggings so i was putting

think it's adding a little bitmore volumeto my booty so thisone's i think it's very pretty it'sactually having pockets bothon the back of the booty and on the sideof theof the thighs and they are legit pocketsall of them so you can put things thereif you want toso this is a non-seamless so they dohave a middle seamthey are higher in the waist and thesehave an elastic band in the top so imean i guess it depends on if you likethe elastic bands or notum i don't mind so much i mean i prefernot having elastic bands in the top ofthe leggings buti don't mind in this ones because theyare hitting melike perfectly in the fl more flatteringpart onmy waist i have this in size medium alsothey go on squat prooflong enough in the legs i will say thatthis fabric is covering upcellulite also i don't have any problemwith my cellulite peeking throughand the fabric is thick enough fortugging me inand not being see-through or anything ilove this color this color is so uniqueit's like thisaubergine purpley i really dying forthis color i think it'ssuper super nice the fabric is verystretchy as isaid but it's leaving me with somecompressioni will say you can go running and youcan do anything you want in theseleggings because they are staying 100 inplace they will notfall down anything so you will not haveany problem with thatand they are as i said long enough inthe legs alsoso in this leggings honestly i havenothing bad to say about themmaybe i mean it depends on if you likethe middle seam or not i don't have anyproblem with camel toe butonce again i think it's because i havethem in the right side i do like thehigh waist but i mean it depends on ifyou likethe elastic band or not i am going totake the mesherof course in size medium as i saidright across the waist where the elasticband is hitting we have30 centimeters which is 11.8 inchesso i will say that they are very true tosize because the elastic band is hittingfurtherup so it's not uncomfortable in any wayand i

hi everyone abby here today i'm going tobe reviewingthe lululemon double strap face maskbut before i get started make sure tohit that subscribe button so you canstay tuned to all my new videos droppingweeklyand so you can help the channel grow andmake sure to stay tuned to the end ofthe video where i'm talking about mygiveawayso this is the lululemon double strapface mask i'm going to post the color onscreen for you guysand it does have two straps on the backthat are adjustableto go over your head this is what itlooks like on the insidethere is really nice stitching going allthe way around it there's no kind ofloose threadsor anything like that which is good i dowant to say that it does not have likeany adjustable kind of wiring at thefront for the bridge of your noseand it doesn't really have anyadjustable you know spots on the maskother than the strapso how this face mask works is basicallyyou put it on over your head the bottomstrap goes on firstand that's kind of at your lower neckarea and the top strap goes around yourheadafter using this for about two months ido want to say that it is very durablei have washed it so far about four timesand it looks just askind of good as new quality wise i domake sure to you know washmy lululemon stuff in cold wateron low spin and hang it to dry i reallydo like the color of this and i think itlooks nice onand if you're just looking for like aregular mask to wear around every day ithink this is a great option for youbecause it is a single layer face maskis non-medical gradeum just so you guys do know that onething i have to say that is amazingabout this face maskis that because it goes around your headthere's no pressure on your ears at allso this is great for people who havelike ear piercings or people who do havesensitive ears because i know whenyou're wearing the traditional masksif you're wearing them for an extendedperiod of time it really does get taxingon your ears and it starts to hurtso that is one amazing feature aboutthis mask i also do think that it'spretty stylish onand it's comfortable to wear like i saidfor a long period of timei want to let you guys know this is madeof lululemon's ultra lou fabricit's sweat wicking quick drying it hasfour way stretchand these straps are very adjustable soyou can like really adjust them a lothereso i think this fits basically everysize head i mean you can adjust it allthe way down hereand you can adjust it all the way upthat is fantastic about this mask i willsayit does take a couple minutes to adjustit just to get it for the right fit foryour headso to get it uncomfortably so it doesn'tmove around but when it is on your facei will say that it doesfit um very like flushed against yourfacethere's not really any like gapping oranything which is nice i'm happy that itdoes fit well because like i saidthere's like kind of no adjustabilityaround therei'm just talking about kind of puttingthis face mask on i do want to say it'sa littlebit awkward because you do have to kindof pull the two straps over your headbut once you get it on it's verycomfortable to weari'm going to go ahead and show you guyswhat it looks like on mei don't like that this happens sometimesit kind of divotsin there all right guys so here's theproduct information and for anybodyinterested about reading thatso one thing i do want to say is i wishthat they would have been in like apocket fora filter um i think that would have kindof elevated this mask to the next leveland hopefully they do that in the futurebut for right now everyone's stillsocially distancing i think that this isa great match just to wear out and aboutand in terms of working out in iti worked out in this mask about twice sofar it is umdefinitely very moisture wicking i don'tfind my face to be like extremely sweatyor anything as i'm wearing itbut i do want to say that if you arelike running or anything i would notrecommend this for that personally wheni did try running in it it's just kindof hard to breatheum after a certain period of time ifyou're doing like walkingor something kind of more low intensityi think it's better for that if you'relooking to work out in this maskone great thing about this mask is thatit's very low profile onit's not really like flashy or anythingbut it's nice it does go with like a lotof different outfits and differentcolors thereso considering the price the qualitythe ease of use the adjustability thecolor everything like that i would goahead and give this face maskan 8.1 out of 10. i think this is agreatoption for those of you looking for justlike a basic face maskand in terms of their pricing it'shonestly not bad i think it's prettyaffordableit's right on par with like every othercompany that is releasing umkind of you know cloth based basic facemasks but this one does have you knowa different mechanism because of thatdouble strap i definitely think thedouble strap isexcellent it's very comfortable ifyou're looking to wear it for longperiods of time and you just wantsomething that's going to be comfortableand non-irritatingi would definitely go ahead andrecommend this to you i do give it athumbs uppersonally i like to use this when i'mgoing out for my walks in the morningi think it's nice and comfortable and ifi go you know past anyoneum i feel like more protected havingthat there and i like to use it when thegrocery store runs and errands and stufflike thatso if you guys are interested in buyingthis face mask i'll definitely put alink in the descriptionbelow for you to use all right guys sonow i'm

all right what's up you guys so Ithought today I would sneak into mybedroom because it's the only semidecorated semi put together room in thehouse I thought I'd take a corner andshow you guys some of my favorite recentgarage sale finds um and these arethings that I scout out the night beforeI look for garage cells that look likethey might be selling fancy itemsdesigner item there was a yard salewhere they were advertising Lululemon soof course like alarm bells are going offand I put that right on my lap they didsay that they were not charging likecheap prices they were gonna they theywarned customers $20 or more per itemsso I knew I'd have to be selective aboutwhat I picked because things like tanktops for Lululemon it's not worth paying$20 for it unless it's like a reallyrare print so I was looking at primarilylong leggings special patterns forskirts and even like capri leggings andeven then like they still had beyond theLululemon they had really cute like FreePeople and Tory Burch and cute thingslike that so but I'm gonna go over myfavorite finder that day and it's thesethese are the Lululemon Beach scapewonder under leggings I knew when I sawthem that it was an interesting andunique print anytime you see aninteresting unique print remove I'm inlike you should hone in on it like ahoming pigeon so I definitely zeroed inand tractor-beam straight to the weirdprayer to Peru them andand I brought these home looked them upand comps are crazy people have theselisted for 300 plus dollars now I don'tthink the sold listings reflect actuallygetting $300 so I have priced mine at250 and we'll see what I get butsuper-crazy fine and then in addition Ifound some Lululemon skirts and like forthose of you who are brand brand newLululemon is this little symbol herethere you goLululemon so always look for that eventrained my husband I'm like you knowwhat Lululemon looks like write the logohe's like yeah yeahI have quizzed him many times um theseruffle skirts like again unique printsunique patterns camo print anythingthat's like camo print this is like it'skind of like the oil slick camo printfor these speed shorts those will dogreat and I learned also that this ifthe Lululemon symbol has if the symbolhas anything special around the logothat's unique it's a sea wees printwhich are even more rare and unique sosea wees SCA wh e ze and they'll be fromcertain years and it's just easier tolook up that way so if you see that tagthat is a Seabees print um yeah and thenagain I picked up probably I want to say20 pieces of Lululemon at that garagesale and again I had to be pretty selectselective I told them if you haveleftover and you want to lower the priceI will come back so I always kind ofthrow that out there I let people knowwhat I do and they know exactly what Ido and they're really sweet but yeah I'mhonest I just st. if you wanna get ridof itgirl I'll give you a fair price um okayand then a couple more for eBay I'm sureyou've seen these I always think ofParks and Rec when I see these vibramore Vibram Five toe shoes because likeChris introduces them to Andy rightanyway so these always always sellanywhere from thirty five to fiftydollars depending on condition and styleso yeah I always grab these things for adollar and then um I pick a fossilpretty regularly that focuses andanything fossil that's like a largecrossbody right don't know why I justtried that on um anything that's like acrossbody or a messenger style bag fromfossil so it's really fast for me so Ialways kind of pick those up in fact Ihad one that I purchased for two dollarsit was a little bit larger had the flapover was a leather fossil messenger bagand it sold within a day for $55 sosomething to keep in mind not all fossilis great but the messenger bags and thecross bodies do really well and thenanother thing you might not be lookingfor breast pumps this one was literallybrand new um never been open never beenused breast pumps so great for me oneBay I have sold and that guy prefer tosell brand new breast pumps um forobvious reasons so I found this brandnew I will sell it on eBay Amazon itjust always seems to be restricted inthose little trickier eBay is wherethose kinds of items go and this shouldsell for this brand is hygeia high jayait should sell for anywhere from onehundred two hundred and fifty dollarsnow moving on to Amazon framesI found this remote and you may thinkit's a remote who cares this universalremote sells for like over a hundreddollars new so in fact I think it sellsfor $100 use and go back and what goodcops again but I will be sending this toAmazon remotes are great especially ifthey look big fat and fancy and ouruniversal remotes because people losermows all the time and people want oneremote for like their whole movie systemor their TV systems so these universalremotes really sell well because peoplewant to buy them they don't want to haveten remotes out on their console anotherthing I always pick up our game gameconsoles and even if the controller isjust by itself I will always pick it upespecially actually only if it's an OEMcontroller meaning if it's the originalmanufacturer controller like there's alot of knockoffs that like are offbrands I never get those I always pickup it says there that logo yeah thesecontrollers do great and it sellsconsistently first one you to $30depending on Commission and depending onstylethis was another fun find these this isa flight system controller okay and itcomes with this thing and you would lookat it and go I don't know what is thatthing and I would think the same thingexcept I've picked them up several timesand this particular one sells for 130 to150 dollars like I guess I don't knowlike the logic behind it I think there'sa lot of flight simulation games thatrequire fancy controls or I don't knowif it's for flight school practice orwhat but these sell great and the rankis crazy good so I would always like ifyou just start randomly seeing thingsthat look interesting and unique go lookit up I just find the like name thebrand name right and then I just willlook that up on Amazon and there itpulls up it's so easy so um that wasanother fun find and then this booktextbooks I love selling textbooks now Ican remember what this one specificallysold sells for I think between 40 and 60dollars these textbooks sell great Iwill always stop and look at textbookswhen I am at yard sales now when you goto yard sales you're gonna see a millionbooks and it can be overwhelming tothink I have to scan all of them so isto just go through to the text books bigbooks large books hardbacks fat booksEnglish type books like like any kind ofuniversity style book fiction Passovercookbooks Passover I would look athistory books religion books butbiographies Passover there's just a lotof random books set you can guaranteelike yeah maybe there's a biography outthere or a fiction book out there thatsells for a lot but odds are you're notgoing to find it at a garage sale so ifyou're in a hurry like go straight forthe textbooks history books English bigfat college looking but stuff likeum yeah that's it I want to make thisshort and sweet and just show you guyssome cool things you can find at garagesales um it's really not hard I thinkyou should just like I know the seasonskind of winding down but hopefully thoseof you in climates where it's all yearlong will have the motivation just goout and make some deal definitelysomething to look into if you're notalready and plus when you go to garagesales and yard sales you're findingthings before they go to the thriftstore before people pick through themlike you're getting them straight fromthe sourceand it gives you an opportunity to makeconnections like you've got yourbusiness card she exchanged phonenumbers say hey this is what I do youhave more stuff I'll sell it for you andit might not work out all the time buthey you never now went it well that's itfor

next place I went to was UrbanOutfitters and I finally got the pinkbag I've been wanting this bag for solong and it's so stupid because itliterally looks like a potato sack[Music]hey guys it's Zoe and welcome back to mychannel so for today's video I have aspring the haul for you guys well it'sreally just a haulI mean it's spring but like so I've donequite a lot of shoppingwell I always do quite a lot of shoppingbut recently I've been shopping a littletoo much so I figured why not do a haulfor you guys okay so here we go just alittle disclaimer I'm not trying to bragin any way no but I'm really not tryingto brag I just have to say that and sohere's the thing that God let's all lookthem so the first place I went to wasPacSun and I never buy anything fromPath 7 ever but I went to outlets inCamarillo and they were having sales soI had to get stuff they were having likea buy one get two thing from theclearance thing or whatever it's calledso everything oh my god okay so thefirst thing I got from pack set is thiscropped um you see it it's a black shirtand it has a little Crossy thingies hereand it's three-quarter length sleevessuper cute I'm pretty sure it's from thebrandy Melville section although itdoesn't say it just says one size so I'massuming it's from brandy but the nextthing I bought from there was just asuper cute t-shirt and it's not a supercute t-shirt it's a t-shirt but I justreally like the color and I got it in asize too big because they didn't have mysize so I have to get it a size above soit'll look cute if I tie it and it'sreally nice mint green color and it haslike foldy things on the sideand the last thing I got from PacSun atthis bralette it's a really cute colorI've been actually really like to useblue color recently it just it's just abra and it has two strappy things butit's a little big on me so I have tolike tie it somehow I'm not having to dothat but next least I want to wasforever 21 and I got quite a few thingsfrom there because recently Trevor 21has been really good like I don't knowlike sometimes they're like really badand I never find anything there and likerecently like they're doing great solet's see what I got so the first thingI got was this again croppedthree-quarter length shirt it looksreally plain in the front but in theback it's as a cross crisscrossdetailing and it's really cute nice arose color and I'm pretty sure I worethis in the video things girls do whenthey're humble out and so okay nextthing I got was a bodysuit and I didn'town a bodysuit until like recentlybecause I just bought it at home umanyway so it's just this light pinkbodysuit it suits down in the back andit's really cute I have I worn it beforeI think I've worn it once I don't reallyknow how to wear body suits because Iwear leggings most of the times and Ifeel like it might look weird withleggings like Dora jeans but I only haveone pair of jeans wrong storyso let me know if you think I shouldwear this with something else sirso the next thing I got was this croppedtank top from forever 21 because I justI'm showing you the things I got forepisode on okay um and I really like itI don't really have anything like thiswell I have tank tops but none of themaren't cropped and none of them arepurple so this is really cute with thejean jackets I'm Lauren pork and Ireally like it next thing I got wassimilar to that one because I actuallygot it on the same day you know it'sfeeling really crop tank top vibes so Igot this one um this is not something Iwould normally wear at all in fact Idon't really like orange in yellow andred together but I think it's reallycute it's different it's also straightright here so there's no like swoop oranything it just goes straight acrossand I like it and again this would lookreally cute with a denim jacket or jeans[Music]next thing I got with another tank topbut this is a little more fancy I guessI guess I could dress this up just cuzof the material but it's this green pinktop and I think it's cute I have likethat like a sweet sweet like a tanjacket I can wear it with and I think itwould look really nice next place I wentto was Lululemon and I'm very excitedabout this um no I did not get anotherpair of leggings even though I reallywant more Lulu leggingsthey're really nice and I'm reallycomfortable so let me know if you wantto get me sound I'm just kiddingso from Lulu I got a headband they gaveme a huge bag for a headband so okay Iactually went to get this in black and Istill want it in black but I saw thisone and I really liked it it's like aindigo indigo blue color it reallybrings out my eyesoh talking to cameras really fun Ireally got a great response back nextplace I went to was Urban Outfitters andI finally got the pink back I've beenwanting this bag for so long and it's sostupid because it literally looks like apotato sack but the other bags I thinkthey used to be like black or somethingbut I really like pink and it's reallycute and I'm saying so from here I gotto bra less the first one being able tosee white one you know so it's just itlooks like this I have a bra left fromhere that is a halter top and I'm not abig fan of halter top so I got it in adifferent style that is not a halter andI'm taking it I like it moving on tonext throw away next one I got is thisand okay this looks so weird it doesn'teven look like a bralette it looks likea like a tank top that they cut tooshortand like I don't know it it's I got itit was on sale and I liked it and Ithink I'm gonna get use out of itbecause if there's an open back shirtthis covers your bra and makes it looknicer than a bra strap that's me tryingto justify wife watch shopping okay alsofrom Urban Outfitters I got two thingsfrom Mario Badescu finally I've beenwanting these for so long I got the rosewater spray and the drying lotion Ireally like both of these I ought tofeel like I spray this all the time sohow are freshI Spit this too often and also that thisI'm still trying to figure out if itworks 100% I'll let you guys know I'llkeep you up so this is just forhydrating but this is supposed to belike the twisted dry off your sis andKylie Jenner recommended it so obviouslyI had to get it cuz obviously worksright so 11 next weeks I went to wascotton on and from here I just got at-shirt but I have a story behind thist-shirt so I went to cotton on right Iwas looking and I was looking and therewasn't anything that I was like wowthat's cute and so I was like I can findanything basically so I was looking atthe sable relics and I saw this t-shirtand I was like oh this color is so cutebut like it wrinkles so much whatever soI was just trying a bunch of stuff onand then I looked at the price for thist-shirt if you can guess how much it wascalming it right now I'll give you sometime in the meantime look how cute it isit's just a green t-shirt okay no moretime to comment this was three dollarsso I think this would be super cutewithout white bra let I showed you somejeans and tied up thank youI like it so effort okay honestly I hatelong t-shirts because what's the pointlike it just goes over your butt and itfeels like weird so I think I can tie itand it's super soft so three dollart-shirt but by the way when I goshopping I usually walk into the storeand go straight to the sale rack becauseyou do not know what you can find in thesale rack and I've got a three dollart-shirt so you know then I work my wayup to like the price your stuff in frontbutthere's nothing wrong see I rock okayeven the brats from Urban Outfitters Ishowed we're from the sale rocks

everysingle week just to kind of shock mybody and just make sure that I'm doingdifferent kind of movement so my bodydoesn't get really used to it and so Iactually keep on seeing results I know alot of you might not be in the sameposition I'm in so here are some of mytips to a flatter tummy when I firststarted working out I did not haveanything close to ABS I mean I never wasoverweight but I was you know I wasn'taesthetically pleasing you know what I'msaying at least in my opinion I did notlook fit at all I first started going tothe gym you know I mean what I do now Igenerally I couldn't really do it youknow it was like hard so like if youcan't do what you know what you seeevery ball the celebrity Fitness peopledoing or what I'm doing they don't startoff from the very from very beginningyou know do crunches then do sit-upsthen focus on your form then really youknow like start squeezing when you'reflexing like during those exercises youknow to feel it and then you know juststart moving up and you know if myexercises are too easy for you like thenathlete you know like add weight likehold a barbelleither like you know either likeincrease the size of the medicine ballor you know put a bigger weight betweenyour feet which is actually pretty hardconsidering you like my feet are reallytiny and Department the friggindumbbells like weight thicker is thatwhat I had was like hoping for so itkept on like slipping it was like reallyhard to like get a hold up start offwith like little exercises you know workyour way up you know no one starts offyou know with shredded ABSno no one starts off with like musclesyou like no one no one everybody everysingle like fitness person that's at thevery top right now had their very firstday in the gym just try to staymotivated don't get discouraged you knoweverybody had their day one and theywork their way up to where they are nowobviously so you know if you keep ongoing you can get there too I would alsosuggest you guys to focus on your dietbecause that is a major key dj khaledthat is a major key to losing unwantedfatyou know like I personally believe it is80% like diet and then it's 20% fitnessyou know at the gym so you don't startoff you know like you can start off easyyou can start off cutting off sodasjuices alcohol um basically justdrinking water you can then start offwith cutting out you know eating out andeverything like that and if you do needout then but try to eat healthy you knowyou can't not do that um you know justby cutting out like simple sweets likelike simple stuff out of your diet itcan make a huge

oh it's Sarah again this is my secondvideo and before I begin I would justlike to tell you to not mind myappearance right now so here we go thisvideo will be a hall featuring someclothing for a workout attire that I'vepurchased over the past probably maybethree weeks it's not like I just wentout in one time just bought all thisthat would be hard so let's begin withNike so these were in my last video howare these shoes I love them I reallywanted a pair of plain white shoes sothese are the rough seen ones and I'musually a size 17 1/2 in shoes but theysaid to get a size smaller but it turnsout that they didn't have a 7 on line soI actually got an 8 and they actuallyfit fine but I haven't worked out in themix I'm kind of on a break from the gymI'll tell you more about that later solove these and these are my favoriteshoes ever I love them they're theFlyknit roshi ones and they're in thislight blue colorthe material is a higher quality thanthe regular Russian ones I guess that'swhy they were a little bit moreexpensive but I think it's worth itI'll have these for a long time can'twait to work out then I got black whereshe ones and they have the Platinumswoosh about them and these are all thesame size they're all in E they didn'thave any seven and a half or seven anyof these colors they all fit fine so I'mgladand maybe I found these two items onlinethey are from the tide of the momentcollection it's kind of if you don'tknow about it I'll explain a little it'sthis very rare thing that Nike doeswhere they come out with a title at themoment that is a tight and a sports braand they only have it for sale for alimited amount of time once it's soldout it's gone and then a bunch of peopleI guess buy it up and then resell it oneBay for a lot more because that's whereI found these items but I love them andI actually got great deals on them and Iwore a pair of them in my last video thewinter workout attire one and I actuallyjust sold those and I kind of regret itbecause I love them so I'll post apicture but if you want to see them theyhave doves they're very cool so this isa sports bra I actually posted this onmy Instagram Sarah Marie it left theback love this so cool looks it wasinspired by like candy wrappers and funthings like that playing around thefabric and these I've been searching forfor the longest time they came out in2013 and they are calledthe arctic modern I couldn't find thesports bra though baby wanted it andthey're just this really cool like whiteand creams and golds and grays back theyare so flattering on I only wore themonce and I got so many compliments Ididn't work out in them I just walkedaround because I'm honestly afraid towork out and then because I'm afraidthat I'll tear them or something willhappen so I think I'm gonna sell thesetoo because I'm just like two free towork out in them but I love themmy favorite part is the society detailthe Nike swoosh I think that's so frommy local Marshalls which I love I get alot of wearing our clothes are actuallythey have great deals I got this NewBalance white sports bra because Ineeded just plain white a lot of whiterunning tops and athletic tops but Idon't have a white sports bra so I kindof need one it's back it's very goodsupport good quality it'll last you awhile and then I got one in light pinkit's kind of a bubble gum color cottoncandy colors I'm your favorite so I'mexcited about this oneand it has this like cool like materialI'm excited and it actually I didn'trealize this until I got home afterbuying it but it has like a push-up missto the pads so it'll provide some extrasupport which is good for working outexcuse me and then from forever21they're active recollection I got thismesh shorts bro well it's not like meshall around but it's mesh up to your neckwhich is really cool I've never reallyseen that in a sports bra because mostsports bar just kind of end and thenhave that straps but this is really coolit's high-necked I guess and it has thislike lattice material we'll see aboutthat I've never really worked out infront of 21f etic year but I wasperusing their website and they actuallyreally stepped up their game they'rereally cool like tops now and pants andsports burrows so I'm gonna get more ifthis stuff works out and then I got thissports bra from forever 21 it's kind ofa faux leather look but when it came outof just pointed paws it looked more likea trash bag on me then faux leatherbecause I guess that's how the materialsdays and it was kind of baggy on mebecause I guess I got I should have gotextra salon I got a small but it has oneshoulder and I thought that was reallycool haven't worked on this yet butwe'll see how it holds up with like oneshoulder it might not be that supportivebecause if it ends up fitting more likea bando and slides I'll probably use itmore for fashion purposes than workingout and then from forever21 they alsogot this sports bra it's purplecaged back caged fun you shoulddefinitely check out for our twenty onesactivewear and then this final sportsbra I've been looking for one that isthis Lululemon it's called the solo bracan't find it anywherethey don't make it anymore Lululemonit's not nowhere so I found it verysimilar looking one at forever 21 I meanit doesn't go as low and as long as thesolo bra but it's the general gist ofthe look of it that's the back I lovethis it's like a tomato a reddish orangepretty cool and then sorry a lot ofsports bras but from a Victoria's SecretI got this one it's pink by VictoriaSecret just after all that but I figuredI could use those sports bras it's justit's similar to a lot of my support rodsand I love the color it's like aheathered aqua marine I would call it ora teal and then I got this front zip Ithink it's called the knockout bra it umlet me see if I can get it open giveyourselfokay that's issues oh I think it'scaught these are my muscles okay therewe go okay so just to explain it it hasmolded cups and then built in underwirewhich is really nice this is a 32a andI'm actually worried about it being alittle too big whole seat but you closethe clasp and then you zip it up I haveI had one and then I resold it becauseit was too big it was a 32b which isusually my size but it it was too big soI'm hoping the 32a will work and if notthen I just can't wear the molded cupbras and I wear that one in a photoshootso it's on me Instagram something it'sbecause I have them in black in thismaterial you can wear it in a snow therain just walking around it's great anyseason fall spring except for summerwell here it's warm but it's a reallynice jacket and I got it for eightydollars down from 150 so that's a greatdeal the Northeast very high quality Ilove it it's very warm and it'sform-fitting a lot of my jackets arekind of like boxy even if they're mysize they don't have a very feminine cutbut this particular jacket does which Ilove so this is a keeper I love it andthen from Lululemon I got this one Ididn't get from Lululemon I got it forlike $50 from like eBay or somethinglike that but I had to have it because Isaw that it was lavender one of myfavorite colors I'm really into pastelsso this is itbecause it it's kind of an older styleof it it's either the former the definejacket and um yeah that's it it fitsreally nice and snug and it's super cutethat's the back I'm very surprised thatI found that price because whenever Iget them at the store they're the retailfrom like 108 up some of them are like118-120 there's they're really nicejackets I love them and they're veryhigh-quality a lot of people complainabout the pilling on them but I takereally good care of mine I'm sure theydo - look I don't put my through thedryer I only wash it when I absolutelyneed to like if I sweat in the jacketphysically I'll wash it but if I'm justwearing it to the gym I'll wait a coupletimes before washing it I got the wonderunder crop love these pants they're justthe plain waist though but I prefer thehigh waist so I might return them I'mnot sure I get excited get the highwaist custom you can never have too manyblack yoga pants and they're the full-onblue on I love that material there's afunny story of how I got them um thisparticular pair because I had a pair Iwas totally in love with it was a rareprint but unfortunately um they got alittle tear in them it was like this bignot really noticeable but it bothered meso I called Lulu cuz I know that they dothe free hemming so I called and said doyou do free repairs because I know youdo free hemming and they have excellentcustomer service and told me that theywould take them back and give me a freenew pair like a replacement which Ithought was excellent most stores don'tdo things like that so they did that formeand cuz I just want to get in and getout so I just kind of picked one andleft I didn't really have time to liketry on and do a bunch of looking aroundso I got the black because I knew likeyou can't go wrongbut I might go and try to see if I canexchange them for the higher waist oncewhich brings me to these I love thesethey have the high waist and they're theWonder Underpants oh there you go fulllife then I love this kind of farminggreen colormy sister's in the army so I love thatshout out to Lizzie and then I got thissports bra it's just black and it haskind of these like shaped cops there'sno wiring or anything and there's theselong lines so it's pretty coolthat's ruler also and it looks like mybattery's dying so I will finish thishaultomorrow probably hello I'm back excusemy hair um it's very curly so a lot oftimes I end up having to throw it upinto a bun so I apologize for that solet's jump right back into it um anotherthing from the Lululemon I'm so excitedabout this it's a camo form jacket Ilove it so not really a big like am aperson but I've been getting more intoit with um a lot of like then my kitcame a little camera I think it's reallycool but I don't wear it like I think Ionly own Candle workout apparel otherthan that it's really nice material I'mreally excited about it and then onemore thing from Nike is this Nike Prot-shirt um it's just like they'reregular spandex material feels likethey're Nike Pro shorts and it'stight-fitting and it's very fitted soI'm excited about that it's an extrasmall and I really love the color sobecause I own

really super nice yesassociate at Lululemon quitting inballoon lemon I know loom is a veryexpensive brand like no kidding it isprobably one of the most expensiveathletic workum why not for the no lovin first cameout I actually made fun of it a lot iwas like wow like Hello expensive mostexpensive yoga pants in the world likewho the hell would like paper thing likethat um and then I bought something fromthem and then I felt like it wasdifficult for me to make fun of them butI only buy lululemon when it's on salebecause i personally think that theirretail items thus the retail standardcosts were standard prices for theirclothing items is just ridiculous Idon't think it's worth it but on sale Iactually think they become reasonablypriced priced not that they becomeaffordable but they come they becomelike what I think like high qualityathletic sports wear clothing should beor extra cost so yeah I have actuallystarted shopping a lululemon actuallyvery recently I started last year yeslast year I only by their sports brasand they're running shorts I don't doyoga so I don't buy yoga pants and Idon't I also don't think it's worth itto buy yoga pants that expensive I stilldon't think so so I don't um so I wentto the lululemon in fashion island innewport beach and i only purchase likethree things cuz well it starts going mypast the hundreds after you could dothat so here's a pair of running shortsreally flashing orange e i love therunning shorts are very comfortable verylightweight um this is their splitsecond shorts and it was originally $54and i got it for 34 and then i gotanother pair of running shorts it'stheir super squad shorts it wasoriginally 54 and i got it for 39 or ithought i would get it for 39 I willtell you guys that later and then thisis their Liberty short um these arethere they're super tight shorts likeyou can use for yoga I I use them forbiking and then originally 54 and i gotit for 39 orthat's what I thought and then the castthe guy who was working at the registerlululemon he was so nice he was likeI'll just chart all of them for thirtyfour dollars so the two that weresupposed to be 39 he reduced them evenfurther to 34 which means i got threeitems for thirty four dollars and thattook an extra eight dollars off comparedto the sale price which made me reallyhappy you know it's like not a lot butyou know it's still something so he wassuper nice his name is greg by the wayGreg a lululemon in the fashion islandum yeah super nice guy I didn't evenshow you my receipt um can you guys seeit is it focusing hope so but yeah allof them were thirty four dollars eachyay um I do think they're called is verygood I just tend to think of theoverpriced so I when you buy on sale butum yeah that was it for my purchaseuh-huh very fast but I hope you liked ityou know i do recommend to the lemon ifyou are a very active person and youknow you use your gym clothes very oftenand it gets worn pretty quickly fromwashing and using them their stuff isgood quality I just recommend that youbuy it on sale unless like there'ssomething that you have to have but yeahsale prices like or so much better thanlike standard retail prices and yeah andI don't think there's any I bought likedrug store stuff that's not veryexciting yeah that's it so that was mymini loom and haul hope you enjoyed itand I'll talk to you later bye hieveryone zillions I just came back fromthe gym I have to tell you two thingsthe first thing pissed me off and secondthing was probably inappropriate but Ithought it was hilarious so the firstthing was it's around like ATM in themorning i'm driving to the gym and thiscrazy guy in his BMW hatchback just likegoes way above speed limit in a suburbanneighborhood and cuts like two redlights and like zooms off and i was likeWTF like what the heck like what is yourproblem and like I like haunted him waslike dude man like you're dangerous andyou're scary and like this guy was inhis 40s with like dark brown

continue to growexponentially a lot of successfulcompanies started with specializedbusiness models and when they ran intotrouble they pivoted to something newnike started out selling footwear andnow they're the largest supplier ofathletic apparel and equipment lululemonyou started out as a yoga brand and youhave begun to pivot but haven't quitecompleted your turn yet it's like whenyou're at a yoga class and you'reconfident your tree pose is on point youhold it you feel determined you feellike you've got it but then you startshaking no no I really don't got it thenyour instructor comes over

exclusive or must havewhen too much inventory has led todiscount sales that you've advertised onyour own website with slogans like leaveme too much we've done our research andhave made several key insights aboutyour position Lululemon not only are youup against other yoga brands such asgaps atleta you're competing with giantssuch as Nike and under armour thesebrands have an undeniable stronghold inthe market due to their ability to reachtheir target audiences Nikes dominanceis maximized by highly recognizableswoosh logo and it's catchy tag lineslike just do it Nike has shown masteryin connecting with its audience membersboth Nike and under armour have shownexpertise and marketing strategy byusing world-renowned celebrities forbrand endorsements these brands haveallocated millions of dollars to theirmarketing efforts Lululemon if you hopeto remain a strong contender in thiscompetitive market you will have toreevaluate your competitive strategiesso now it's time to draw back to yourCenter and identify your uniqueness howdoes Lulu differ from Nike athleta andunder armour these fitness apparelgiants may have greater financialresources and celebrity endorsements butwhat makes Lululemon special and givesyou a competitive edge is that you are apremium Fitness brand that inspirescustomers to lead a powerful and healthylifestyle through fellowship this iswhat Lululemon values at its core andwhat needs to be communicated to itsconsumers now on to the stuff that makesstakeholders giddy as a may 2015 thecompany's stock has experienced world ofover three hundred and twenty-sevenpercent since its initial publicoffering in 2007 currently Lulu's marketcapitalization is 9.2 billion dollarswhile market giant Nike is at ninetyseven point eight billion dollarsalthough you have been able to achieveexponential growth in a short period oftime with the current neeche marketingyour net income has decreased by sixteenpercent from last year thus far thisyear you've made

and make investors happydon't subscribe to mediocrity step yourgame up and the rough tough retailbusiness consumers are what makes theworld go round so it should go withoutsaying that we performed extensiveconsumer research prior to developingour master plan qualitative interviewssurveys and observations were conductedin order for us to obtain a greaterunderstanding of consumer purchasingbehavior along with their attitude andperceptions of the lululemon brand andits competitors the following are keyinsights from our research we found thatmale shoppers and Lululemon are scarcemale consumers observed in store wereoften accompanying their girlfriend orwife secondly consumers are mostattracted to brands for their comfortstyle and quality for example 1 femaleparticipants said I like the sporty lookof Nike and the luxury of Lulu themajority of our research participantsown Nike or adidas and had not heard ofatleta lastly participants did notconsider themselves to be brand loyal wedecided an evaluation of Lulu's internaland external strengths and weaknesseswas necessary to set our new objectivesthrough our SWOT analysis we discoveredthat Lululemon's current grassrootsmarketing efforts have led to theformation of a community centric fitnessculture and they've successfullyattracted the affluent customer byshowcasing their products quality andstyling however as we've uncovered inour research Lululemon's marketing isnot fully integrated as it is primarilycentered on its social media efforts andbrand ambassador program thereforeyou're only maintaining relationshipswith existing customers through a narrowselection of mediums but there is greatopportunity to attract new customers ifyou brought in your marketing strategyLululemon in an effort to bring yourbrand to the forefront and effectivelyhighlight your brand advantages we'vecreated three communication objectivesfirst we will convey the versatility ofthe lululemon brand the

that the murals are associatedwith their local Lululemon store butthat there's also one in vancouvermunich sydney and beyond interactingwith the mural and the narratives behindit will stimulate a unifying andinspiring brand experience for theconsumer then we thought how else can weuse the mural how about a unique eventthat brings people together for afitness activity introducing the Luluflash run similar to a flash mob or agroup of people who assemble suddenly ina public place and perform an unusualact for a brief time Lululemon willdecide on a specific date and time sothat ambassadors or

hey everybody this is Rebecca and I amactually doing a lululemon hall today Irecently went to louddon MN thanks toanother very dear friend of mine I guessmy friend spoil me to death which isreally nice because I have been having avery hard time in life dealing with nothaving a job and not being able to finda job I was laid off from a pretty largecorporation and it's been kind of roughever since then but I also in the pastyear lost 35 pounds and I am down from asize 16 I am down to a size 10 anywherebetween an eight to ten that's may seembig to some people but Timmy um a sizeeight I used to model and a perfect sizeeight is what a lot of the on thetelevision home shopping like the QVCand everything they all wanted perfectsize eight they don't want anythingsmaller so the perfect size eight was inmy opinion a perfect way to be I havevery large breasts so when I gain weightthey get really big and they're bigalready stuff it is better to be smallerso I just want to go with go quicklywith you the three things that I gotfrom Lululemon and I got a gift cardrecently from you know who I'm not tomention his name and so I am going to goget my yoga pants I do yoga and sowithout further ado I play golf too sonow further ado the first item I like totalk to you about and Lululemon does notmake clothes for larger women size 12 isthat this largest size that they makethis is a size 10 and what this is thisis actually a tennisI do they call this it's a run pace thatour skirt and this technical skirt isdesigned with long strides in mind nobulk Swift ultra fabric is engineered tofeel light and keep you covered sweatwicking fabric is breathable and hasfour way stretch the light look streamwaistband lies flat on under your topbuilt-in light look stream liner hassilicone grip at the hem to keep it inplace continuous draw cord is easy tocinch mind mid-stride three pocketwaistband so this they had this in alldifferent colors I got this in black tohold this up this is the back and thisis the front I'm not a sucker forexpensive clothing I would prefer to buythings in a relatively cheaper mannerbut these little lemon has the highestquality clothing I have ever felt or hadany part of in my entire life this isthe pocket in the back it's a shallowpocket you can probably put your ipod inthere and then you just zip it up andyou've got your your your iPod in thereand on the inside let's see if you cansee the detailing that's the drawstringso that if you ever lose the drawstringyou can easily put it back in which isreally nice that's the back side okay sothere are okay in the in the frontyou've got a pocket here so if youwanted to keep tease if you're a golferum gosh anything a pack of gum you keepanything in those little pockets andthen this skirt is actually shortsif you can see that see and thestitching looks a little gathered andgapped but that is because of theelastic that's in it it has to be ableto give and it just is so sturdy theKoch is just a plain crotches there's nocotton or anything in it so if you'replaying on going au naturale with theseon be prepared to sweat because there'sthere's no caught in there then also inthe pant leg you have this pocket forballs which is where golf balls would goor 10 I'm sorry tennis balls and I askedthe lady can you use this for golfingand she said sure you put the golf ballsup in there so I really like this I meanit just has so many neat little pocketsand just the fabric is just realstretchy and giving and it's just a cutelittle design and I even asked her Isaid can you go swimming in this thatshe said sure so I mean if you're reallyhot and you're right by a polar likewe're a vacation in the summertime youknow you go golfing and the last tea orputting green is right near the pool andI've jumped into the pool many timesafter sweating to death on the golfcourse so it's got the lululemon um logoon it there this is just amazing I can'ttalk enough about it and these this wasfifty eight dollars and these were size10 the other thing I got this is like asports bra tank top and it's I think alittle more fancy this is almost likevery thin material but then you have thebuilt-in bra which as you can see goesall the way around the inside all aroundthe inside it is padded and it does haveremovable pads in it if you want to washtake the pads out and wash it the backlooks like this sorry and it's like thatand then the front as you saw is justlike a v-shaped in the back it's got thelululemon logo right there and let meread to you about what this says this iscalled the city tank this breezy tankhas your back as you move format tomojos luon fabric on top is sweatwicking and four way stretch Swift ultralight fabric on the bottom keeps youcool cool max liner is soft and sweatwicking added lycra fibre moves with youand stays in great shape pockets forremovable bra cups medium support mediumcoverage and hip length this is a size10 and it's probably going to be alittle bit too big on me but it was $64and I got it on sale for twenty-fourdollars so I just thought that that wasreally cute see my arms need to beworked out anyway hopefully thismotivates me and then the final thing Igot um this is a size 12 and I got thisas a size 12 on purpose this looks bigand it is big but this is a sweatshirtand this is their design it is so wellmade you should feel the inside of thisis like microfiber it is just amazingand it is like several layers of fabricthe outside is a different fabric fromthe inside you have pockets on bothsides to be able to put your items inlet's see also inside the pocket isanother pocket so if you want to putyour ipod in there you won't lose itit's got the air holes so that's yourarmpit scan for heat there's anotherpocket on this side and you have a nicethe band for your arm now what this isthis is a snapshot crew this stretchycrew neck is designed to keep you cozyas you cruise around town soft and cozypolartec powerstretch pro fabric addswarmth without the weight underarmeyelets allow you let allow you allowyou let you blow off steam hidden pockethelps keep your phone from slipping outI think it's big enough for an ipod andif you try to put an iphone 6s and thereyou won't be able to fit it designed notto shrink for hassle-free laundry loosefit is what they they kept explaining tome you want it to be loose fit and hiplength this was this was a size 12 I didtry on the 10 and if you wear anythingunderneath it especially like in thewintertime which is when i bought itlike a turtleneck or anything longsleeve it can get kind of tight so i didget this in a size 12 and it was ahundred twenty eight dollars and it wason sale for 69 so I know that'sridiculous for a sweatshirt but what shetold me was I do a lot of walking Icannot run I broke

hey guys today I'm gonna do a fun videoI think it's kind of fun it's nothingtoo exciting but it is a collectiveworkout clothing haul video I was tryingto think of what video to put up todayand I was like I don't know what to filmI don't know what to edit what should Iput up for you guys and then I thoughtabout it I'm like oh my gosh I havecollected so many workout clothes in thepast month like I've been on this likekick of buying workout clothes and letme just say yes I want a shirt right nowmy hair is covering it but um yeah Ijust noticed that my hair falls likeright over it makes me look like I'm notsure anyway I've been like Bing shoppingis that a thing we're like I just Idon't know I've been buying my ownclothes and I'm like oh maybe we shouldhave a Nike today and buy something elseand oh I think another reason is as I'vestarted this workout guide I don't knowif you guys have heard of her but hername is Kayla its CNS or something I'llput like her name or picture right heremy friend Jordi and I have started her12-week guide to like a bikini body so Ihave been very inspired to work outbecause we have been going at it forthis is our third week and so buyingworkout clothes really motivates me towork out oh yeah okay so like I saidthis is collective I went to forever 21with Jordi the other week I think I wentto gap the other week as well and then Igot another shirt from gap for mybirthday and then the other day I wentto Nike okay I'll just start it's randomI'll start with Nike though first I wentwith Gary and we went just to look and Iwas like let's go look at the salesbecause it was like an outlet and I'mlike it has to have good sales rightwell I found these pants and I love themI am NOT a big fan of the Nike Pro likethat is that even like a line ofclothing that they have but like I don'tlike their sports bras they like justthe Nike program or you know collectionbut this one isn't it's a different oneso I tried it on andhas this amazing detailing on the sideand it just fits so amazing and it'scool because at the very bottom of thelegs has a zipper that like comes likeunzips just a little bit so maybe it'seasier to get on and off I'm not sureanyway I love these the price I'll tryto remember the price these were mostlylike $75 and I got them for like 40 sothat's a big deal especially for Nikelike I think 40 bucks for a pair ofpants is a good deal from them okay Iwent to forever 21 and I have neverlooked at their fitness wear or theiractivewear and we went to look and I gotlike a little bit too much stuff but Iwas kind of lacking on workout shirts Ihave my staple Lululemon like wonderunders and leggings and stuff from themthat I wear every time I work out I likejust rewear them because there's such agood quality and I love them so I had topick up some shirts the first thing Igot is this white tank top I don't evenknow what you would call it it's supercute it's just flowy I love things thataren't like constricting in like theneck so don't really like things thatare like very like you know close to theneck or like closer on the arms I justnot a fan I like to feel you know veryfree when I workout so anyway this isamazing and the little back is supercute has this like spiral design I'm notsure I love it it's very adorable Iactually got the same style in thisgorgeous teal turquoise color so samestyle same size just in this beautifulcolorand I love it like I said turquoise mustbe my thing because I had to pick up adifferent shirt in the same color thisis different style but I know I love thecolor it's very cute and I think it'svery flattering so this is just a basicone it's kind of when I look at this Ijust think of like a basic workout topthere's nothing really too special aboutit but it fits well and the only thingit fits well but there's one a negativewhat I'm like running or doing somethingit tends to like ride up on the you knowlike right where my hips are like rightwhere the shirt lace at the bottom tendsto right up which is kind of annoying sothat's the only negative about this oneand these were no more than like $10 theones from forever 21 okay the next onethese were I think about 13 so it's alittle bit more they I wish I had like astyle number or something but it doesn'tit just says forever 21 um this one's socute and it's a little bit more flowylike it cuts lower in the back and lowerdown the arms so it kind of shows alittle bit more not like showy but justyou know like cuts down the arm justmore I don't know shows your sports braso if you were a cute sports bra that'sa plus and that material is a little bitdifferent I don't know how to explainthis it's very like these are just basicshirts like if you just make a basicshirt t-shirt feel like they're justcotton I think it doesn't even sayanyway these are definitely differentyou can kind of see by the texture but Ilove them and they're so comfy like Isaid not expensive at all $13 not badokay this next shirt I feel I worked atthe gym the other day and I feel likeone of those people that are riding abike down the middle of the road or notknow but just down the road and they'rewearing those like caution you knowthings that you like put over that'slike very fluorescent and bright I'mfeeling one of those people this isbright orange and it literally lays onyour body like it's kind of just likelaying there so it could look likebecause I'm talking about um well whenpeople stand in like parking lots andthey have those like reflective shirtsdon't be like don't hate me that's whatI feel like when I wear this butwhatever it's cute I guess I just I'mnot used toorange I don't own any orange so maybethat's why I feel that way already now Iwant a gap I'm actually wearing one ofthe shirts right now I love it so muchand I just like forever 21 I have neverbeen to the gap fits clothing store everor the gap body I've never walked inthere and I seek about the gym wearinggap and I'm like I need to go I've neverowned any gap so we walked in one dayand I tried on this shirt was on salefor $12 $12 and originally they're noteven too bad they're like 19 so thankyou to 12 that wasn't that big the salebut it was just like oh my gosh Ithought this was gonna be like a $30.00you know like a 3000 shirt or somethingmore expensive got this shirt fell inlove and it does not ride up like theones from forever 21 do I can feel thequality a little bit better like it'sobviously not forever 21 perfect for mewants not like the best quality butanyway these don't write up at all whichI like it stays in place and same withat the top a pet peeve of mine is whenI'm working out and in like ten minuteslater I look and it's like that you knowit's like bunched up right here so wellright well he actually went back on mybirthday and they said Oh tuesdays are10% off dates so I went and I got thisone it's the same style like I said ohit's the gap fit breathe so maybe isthat like the style I don't know thebreeds tank or something look it up butmy my size is in a small which I wassurprised because I'm usually a sizemedium but the small works same sizejust different color and I love it somuch I feel like I'd do that with somany things it's like if I love one Ineed to go back and get every singlecolor like they have like five more ofthese same shirts and I want to go backand like get all of them how muchGarrett was here filming this with mebecause he want some cool stuff toowhat he's like where I'm tired I'll justshow you guys anyway I got him thisshirtValentine's Day it's the Nike Pro combatfitted drive fit something anyway it islooking good I love this on him it looksso pottering and it's like this nicematerial it's not like just a regularNike tank top t-shirt type feel it'sdefinitely more like Fitness shirt I'mlacking in the sports bra Departmentpretty bad well not really I only havelike two and I go to the gym like everyday of the week almost every day and Ilike to have a variety so I'm to rewearthem because I don't wash my workoutclothes every single time I wear them Ithink that's not really necessary sinceyou know don't be sparkling clean goingto work out you know my point is I don'tknow I went to Lou Lemon yesterday soI'm like maybe not something sale and Ijust went no luck and I wasn't gonna buyanything full price because it is a veryexpensive brand like I can see whybecause the quality is amazing but it'sdefinitely not like that oh let's goshopping let's just go there so they didhave this one sports bra on sale it's alittle bit of a different fit I worethis last night with like one of thosethe white tank top this pretty low likeit's kind of low and this sports bra isvery low let me tell you it's definitelynot a runner sports for something withsupport and thank goodness I don'treally need a lot of supports I'm notvery like chesty in that area but umthat's right it's kind of summarize itanyways they said this is more like ayoga sports bra but I wear it for I justwear it to go workout I do run and I ranin this yesterday and it wasn't itdidn't bug me at all this is what itlooks like it is a beautiful likegunmetal grey color and I like that itgoes down on my like a ghost fartherdown than regular sports bras regularsports bras kind of stopped right likeunder your boob where they're kind ofsupposedbut this like goes about I don't knowlike another two inches down which isvery comfortable love this the onlydownside is very love so I just need toremember to like not wear it with asuper low-cut shirt as well because thenyou know you're at the gym you

Under Armour operates primarily througha wholesale distribution model which ledour group to the West EndDick's Sporting Goods in 2013 thesesales channels made up sixty seven pointtwo percent of total company sales whilethere are various retailers that sellthe Under Armour brand Dick's SportingGoods and Sports Authority are the twopredominant players making up twenty twopercent of total Under Armour sales theother third of Under Armour sales comesthrough calm and the 123branded factory health stores thisstrategy of minimizing the amount ofcapital tied up in fixed costs such asstore locations has allowed Under Armourto continually invest in superiorathletic equipment this model is alsoallowed Under Armour to quickly react toconsumer demand growing sales over 26percent annually the foundation of UnderArmour success lies in their company'smission to provide apparel and equipmentthat enhances athletes performance thispassion stems from their company founderand current CEO chip Wilson who back in1996 saw the opportunity for morespecialized apparel specificallydesigned for an workout use today UnderArmour goes to great lengths to convinceconsumers that by wearing their gear youwill have a superior workout experienceone of the ways Under Armour haseducated consumers of this is throughprofessional athlete partnerships suchas Steph Curry Cam Newton and mistyCopeland in 2014 Under Armour isexpected to spend over 330 milliondollars on marketing this would equal11% of total expected revenue and a 34%increase to last year as Under Armourcontinues to expand their brand theylook to build upon their existingcollegiate partnerships with theUniversity of Oregon and Notre Damegiven Under Armour strategy of providingapparel and equipment specialized todifferent forms of exercise the companyruns a very skew intensive business incontrast to more lifestyle and fashionbrands that increase SKU count throughnumerous pattern and color options UnderArmour's hi SKU count is directlyrelated to the number of workout needsthey cater to as Under Armour haspursued various growth opportunitiesthrough product extensionsthe company has obsessed over findingmarkets where they can provideinnovation that customers will perceiveas yielding superior performance oneexample of this was their entry into theathletic footwear market footwear hasbeen one of Under Armour's top fivegrill strategies in as yieldedtremendous success in the first half of2014Footwear generated 239 million dollarsin revenue matching their total 2013resultsUnder Armour success in this categoryshould come as no surprise as it fitsperfectly within their existing model ofwinning in SKU intensive categorieswhere customers correlate performancewith the quality of product they use onedrawback Under Armour faces from runninga SKU intensive business is potentialmarkdown and unproductive inventory bothonline and in stores Under Armour isvery overt with their clearance productand market in a way that conveys valueand savings for their customers bypursuing a product differentiationstrategy Under Armour must be cognizantof not eroding their brand perception ofbeing high quality equipment that meritsa higher price point in addition toFootwear another one of Under Armour'stop growth strategies is their woman'sbusiness historically perceived as amale first brand Under Armour has goneto great lengths to change thisperception different than many retailerswho approach women's athletic wearthrough the lens of how a woman looksduring a workoutUnder Armour as adhere to their strategyof improving athletes performance UnderArmour has identified several sportssuch as surfing kickboxing and yoga thatare growing in popularity among femaleathletes this strategy was put ondisplay through high profile marketingcampaigns with misty Copeland and GiseleBundchenafter a quick drive to the West End mallwe're ready to visit Lululemon unlikeUnder Armour Lululemon generates over75% of their sales through company ownedstores in total Lululemon operates ahundred and seventy-one stores in theu.s. 54 in Canada and 25 in Australiawhile this sales distribution modelrequires significant capital investmentwe quickly came to realize theimportance Lululemon places by creatinga shopping experience that is consistentwith their brand image for those notfamiliar Lululemon is a high-endathletic apparel retailer whichdifferentiates itself by providingfashionable athletic wear which can beworn before during and after exerciseunlike Under Armour whose products areclearly designed for specific workoutsLululemon is a lifestyle brand one ofthe ways Lululemon has developed alifestyle brand is through their brandambassador program throughout each storeshoppers will find pictures of localambassadors typically yoga studioinstructors who embody the healthylifestyle Lululemon's products arecatered to these ambassadors willregularly hold workout classes in storeas a way of generating organic marketingfor the lulu brand Lululemon'sassortment strategy shares many moresimilarities with traditional fashionretailers than their competition and theathletic wear market by beingdeclarative in the silhouettes ofclothing they offer Lululemon is able tomaintain low SKU counts and insteadprovide differentiation through thenumber of color and patterns in eachstyle for example Liu has 20% of theapparel SKUs Under Armour does and onaverage offers two times the number ofcolors and patterns of a given SKUbecause of Lululemon's association withyoga and fashion the brand is oftenconnected with female clothing but muchlike Under Armour they are working tomake the brand applicable to bothgenders as John and AJ both found outLululemon recently launched the and gocampaign which features seasonallyrelevant merchandise for both men andwomen by introducing a product line thattransitions morefrequently and it's increasingly fashionoriented Lululemon is generatingincentives for customers to shop withmore regularity than just to purchasenew yoga pants to protect their highprice point strategy Lululemon is verysubtle with their clearance merchandiseas a store associate explains to BostonLululemon keeps any discount product instores to a minimum so right now like wehave summer projects markdown I'm justrad since we're like we are openingboxes to dismiss and it wasn't like newor like replenishing product so thingsthat get marked down I'm locked downvery kind spread apart they get markeddown and if they don't sell we set themto it's not uncommon to see markdownsit's just not like we don't always haveithere's markdown section it givesmarkdown shortly then sent out they justbecause not because it's not sandwichesbecause we get we're constantly visitExcel programexactly what constantly being boxes inevery week so one of the greatest riskLululemon faces is a long-term prioritypeople are placing on living a healthylifestyle while Lululemon has been aleader in the rapidly

Haul,39_IqIHgNPE,1409
hey guys welcome back today I'm going tobe doing a fashion haul for you guysbecause I've done a little bit ofshopping my mom and I might have gone alittle bit crazy so I have some stufffrom Victoria Secret Lululemon andExpress and I know I normally don't buythings that are that expensive I'mnormally like a Marshalls girl so we dida little bit of splurging hair but I didchop the sails I've expressed so let'sjust go ahead and get started I'm justgonna start off at Victoria Secretbecause I only got one thing the onlything that I got was this bikini bottomand this is the ruffle cheeky ones I amgoing to be trying everything on exceptfor this because that would be weird butyeah I'm going on a cruise in a fewweeks so I just wanted to get a couplemore of these bottoms I have it in coraland order the black ones and they'reback ordered because I can fit in amedium but I prefer on large becausegirl got a donk and I want to cover itup so I'm still waiting on the black onebut I decided to get a white one sothat's a story secret on to a little oohlemon this store is my obsession I can'tstop shopping there I only go there oncein a while because the mall that has theLulu's is not the mall that I normallygo to is a little bit farther so I onlywanted to get one outfit and this is oneof the outfits these pants I don't knowthe crop because they have differentstyle this might be like the Wonder cropor something but I'll have the linksbelow and it has this mesh here in thefront it doesn't have it in the back Ireally don't know how to show thesepants but here they are I got them in asize 8 and you're probably seeing acolor favorite right now I really justlove the mesh detailing I think it looksso badass and I could wear this to thegym it's a little like risque for thegym but I wear it anywaysbecause I really like to have cuteoutfits to go to the gym not because Iwant anyone to look at me it's because Ido it for myself and I feel better Iwanted towith this camo rates are back and I lovethe material that this isn't I don'teven know how to describe itand I also tore the tag off so itdoesn't have like the description of thematerial but Lululemon has really greatquality stuff I know that their stuff isexpensive but that's why I only wantedto get one thing so I wanted to pairthese two things together which you haveprobably already seen and yeah I justthink it looks awesome I feel like I'mcoming out of like Tomb Raider or likeholiday tea and I just think it's likethe most badass outfit ever the next topthat I got is pretty much the same stylebut it's in pink camo this one's alittle bit different I didn't want tobuy this and then my mom told me to tryit on and I loved it so I decided to getthis too I just really loved the backand it's just really airy and you don'tI mean you sweat it in but it's kind oflike that super dry material like itkeeps you dry even though you're likesweating I got these pants okay so thematerial is 69 percent nylon 31 percentlycra and spandex or lycra spandex Idon't know if that's the same thing butum so it kind of sucks you in and I lovethese pants and they have a littlezipper for some reason these pairsspecifically reminded me of Blue's Clueslike periwinkle the little dog I thinkthat that's what the name was but yeah Ijust love these colors it's like mittenroyal blue and periwinkle and yeah Ijust love it and these are a little bitlonger and they have some detailing onthe side and they also have really deeppockets which is something that reallycomes in handy because I could just putmy phone in when I'm like jogging ordoing the elliptical or and pretty muchanything even when I'm lifting weightsand then it has this little ruffledetail and then the last pair of pantsthat I got were also on sale and they'rejust these black cropped pants and theyhave kind of like a not a scalloped onthe bottom but a little Boop that's howI described it and it kind of is itlooks like leather I really kind of likeSudi from here i mean it looks prettycool because of the different textures Ithink it looks pretty awesome and thiswould also look good with just like aregular t-shirt the stuff that I wear tothe gym is mostly like tank tops andthese but yeah I bet that's what I gotfrom Lululemonand then the last place that I went wasexpressed and again we went a littlecrazy in here but I also shopped from myboyfriend because I love the menswear inthat store so I'll just start off withthe stuff that I got him I already gotin my shirt that he wore to a partywhich like I'll mention I have an outfitthat I wore with it but it was like acolor-block one there's a picture on myInstagram with him in it but I got himthis collared shirt this is like us abright coral II salmon color and I gotit any fitted or that like you can youcan wear they use super slim fit or thefitted fit but I just got him the fittedone and Express is having a great dealtheir deal is still going on that's whyI wanted to do this haul because somestuff is up to 70% off so if you likeExpress and you can't always splurge onthe full price items like I can't like Ialways wait until they have a sale besure it was originally $60 and it wasmarked down to $29.95 but I wanted toget him this shirt I thought he lookedgreat in it for the cruise so the lastthing that I got him in was this poloshirt again really great quality and Ilove the color and he wears these allthe time along with Phoenix so those arelike the favorite thing my favoritethings that I like to buy for him arethe polos and the dressit's and v-necks from Target areprobably like all he wears okay on to mystuff probably one of my favorite topsthat I got there was this peplum top andit's floral and it looks a little bigbut it fits me so um peplum is probablythe most flattering style on my bodybecause it really emphasizes mywaistline so and I has a little zipperin the back I already wore this too andI took the tag off so I don't reallyknow how much it was I got these twoshirts and they're really really softmaterial and they're just the stripedquarter sleeve or 3/4 sleeve polos andthey go down pretty low so I probablyhave to wear an undershirt with itbecause my bra kind of shows so yeah Ireally love this color it reminds me oflike popsicles like orange and cream andI also gotta end this mutual color whichI like better inside out that'sembarrassingyeah that is what that looks like I justthink that is really sophisticated itdoesn't look like itvery sophisticated like hanging righthere but when you see it on you you'llsee that it looks pretty nice and I knowit's a little longer but it's reallyflattering for my body type and the lastthing that I got was probably them itwas the most expensive thing andexpressed that I purchased because Ihave a bad history with rompers I'vetried just a few on like forever 21 orother places and they've never lookedgood on me because I guess I have apretty long torso and like long legsthat are thicker so I have a big problemwith it like being too small around mybutt and my thighs and it just has neverworked out so um I tried this one on andI actually had like an outfit of thenight on my Instagram but I'll show itto you in like a video clip and it'sjust this romper it's black and it hasthis like little ruffle detail on thefront and it is so flattering on me andI wore this to the party that I do mightget ready with me with a utopia pick meand it just looked amazingI can really style this up or down I canwear during the day or at night I reallywant to pair it with some gladiatorsandals but I don't have any yet so Ijust think it's a really basic versatilepiece that I think everybody shouldinvest in and that was originally $80and I got it for like 54 and normally Iwould never spend that much money forjust something like this but it wassomething that really flattered mereally well really really really reallyI can't say really one more time okay sothat is what I have purchased over thepast few weeks if you guys liked itplease give it a thumbs up and commentdown below telling me what you guys wantto see next and also your favorite itemof clothing that was from this haul so Ithink that's it I'll talk to you guys inmy next video I love you guys thank you,1,UC04J-tJQy48zWspQnIuWRZg,Aestephics,15,4,0,63,"['Fashion (Industry)', ""Victoria's Secret (Business Operation)"", 'Don', 'Makeup',

let's debate it now Jon Najarian is ourbull Mike Murphy is the bear bug 30 onthe clock dr. J strike a pose and makercases all right chip Wilson is gone nowunfortunately he still owns as Kourtjust said 25 27 percent of the shares Ithink somebody should take him out ofthose sharesI think that's bad news and it's behindhim now but like I say I'd like him tobe gone direct sales from this companyare up 25 percent year-over-year and Iknow Mike Murphy loves this one theanti-microbial material that they havein these shorts and tops and so forth atLululemon it's not patented but so farthey've been able to defend it nobodyelse has it Murph and I think that's oneof the reasons somebody will go afterhim whether it's via or whether it'sNike whether it's Under Armour somebodygoes after him I think the stock goesmid 50s on a take out okay so I washoping you would go there John were youI love the products from Lululemon andI've been wrong on the stock I owned itin the past but now they've disappointedfor five straight quarters and the talkfrom a lot of people is if it gets lowersomeone's going to come in and take themout but you touched on it the founderthe champ former chairman owns 27 pluspercent of these shares no one's gonnacome in with him in there and buy thisthing out in my opinion so now you'releft with the company that has to getsales have to increase sales have toincrease profitability they have to getback to growth they're not doing thatthey're actually focusing on theironline business that's the only placethey're seeing growth but you touchedyou talked about the microfiber on thesethings this stock was built on thecompany was built on walking into thestores and feeling the products thedifferentiation in the products gapsAthletica department is gaining on LuluI don't I definitely wouldn't buy Luluhere at some point maybe someone takeshim out down the road if you want to bein it being an international opportunityhere is hugefor these guys and that's what thePotvin the CEO new new CEO just said Ithink he's rightI would run with that and at 37 bucks ashare we're at bottom today maybe that'snot the all-time bottom in the nextcouple years but I think it's prettydamn cool they can't perform in the US Idon't know how they're going to promoteI mean beat on expectations first of allthe word expectations doesn't matterit's what the expectations are so inother words they beat on EPS theguidance going forward is 375 million to380 million base rates you subjects aregonna have to be promotional marginscome into play there's a lot of concernon the street doesn't sandbag thequarter he was in there last quarter andI thought he's sandbag but now theyactually lowered him high end of thedollar seven six down to a low end of adollar 50 they have issues all righttell you people of the debate meet us atCNBC fast money who's either the hashtag ball or the hash tag bear we'regonna give you the results as we alwaysdo at the end of the show,17,UCsr1ok1WWt8Is3bfeCbHgqQ,XSTATICPerformance,0,0,0,1,"['X-STATIC', 'antimicrobial', 'anti-stink', 'Lululemon', 'Noble Biomaterials']",Lululemon Halftime Report CNBC National,gab7qonxEH8,418

a review an overview of Lululemon and Iwanted to talk to you guys about mycollection and some of the items that Ihave jackets I have four jackets I havetwo of the scuba hoodies and these scubahoodies are just they're just so easy towear they're like very very thickmaterial and they're so easy to wear andthe hood is very very roomy so thesethis is a scuba hoodie it is really oldit's actually I don't even know if it isa scuba hoodie if they called it likethat back thenbut it's yellow and it's so much fun soyellow it has a Signia here and I havethumb holes because this is an olderversion but this is probably like six orseven years old it's super old but it'sstill in great condition it's very verythick and it's just something that youknow if I need to pick up someone or goto the post office or run errands justthrow this on and it's super warm sothat's that one I have the same a kindin teal so they are a little bit offaded but they're still great conditionand I think one of the ingenious thingsthat Lululemon does is they have thezipper cage so when you zip up your hoodthe metal part it doesn't like it's notcold to your chin the hood kind ofcovers it up and then it has theLululemon insignia on the hoodie andyeah here is the hoodie and then thenext one is the jacket that I'm wearingthis is the dance studio jacket theyhave this online I think or it might besold out it's a hundred and twentydollars I think this scuba hoodies areabout ninety eight and it might be anexpensive jacket you might think but Ihave worn this jacket like like thismonth already like half of the days ofthis month I've been wearing this jacketso it comes like this it is along so itkind of cuts your butt right here andand I just love how form-fitting this isthis isn't a size six it has theLululemon insignia right here very likeit's a hood some clothes kind of go hereyou know it's totally a hood and thenyou could just zip it here and zip itall the way up so if you want to gorunning you can go riding it's a reallygreat jacket to go running and I don'tgo running and it's also reversible guysin the next jacket I have I think it'sthe I don't know what kind of jacket itis so that really old one I think it'sthe defined jacketmy mom where is this a lot it's justbasically yeah this one doesn't havethumb holes I think this came out beforethe thumb holes but it does have theinsignia in the back and in the frontand it just fits so well this jacket andthese jackets are actually really greatif you live in Southern Californiabecause in the wintertime it never getscold enough to actually wear like aNorth Face but these lightweight jacketsare really great for the tops okay sothe No Limits tank is probably one thatLululemon is most known for this istheir no limits tank it's really great alot of companies try to copy thisbasically Lululemon tanks are reallynice because they for some whateverreason they don't fall down so whenyou're doing yoga and you're in downwarddog or you're trying to do a handstandthey don't like typically fall to yourface they'll just stay at the waistbandit's these little details that reallyhelp they have a sports bra most oftheir items have sports bras and theyhave little pockets where you can putpadding in them and then the back islike kind of like a jersey mesh materialso it's really great for if you'resweating because it won't stick or clingto your back it'll kind of give somebreathability and I think this is justso cute the whole you know seeing yourlittle bra through there so I have it inthis color and in a cornflower blue solight it's a light blue andhas the heathered material here justreally nice and a hat Lululemon isreally known for their power white inkswhich is what I'm wearing right now Ireally like this one is pretty old butit's very very I have a bra underneathbut it just is very flattering liketheir tanks lightweight tank but it'svery flattering it goes all the way kindof down to the butt and the way it's cutis just perfectly you get a really nicehourglass shape so again Lululemon isall about those little details if youjust wear a cheap take from forever 21yeah you're gonna get a great workoutbut you're not gonna get that nice likehourglass cut I don't even know whatit's called it's super old justracerback tank here but I really like itbecause it does have a lot of stretchingand here and then it's looser back Ilike my tanks to be racerback forwhatever weird reason has so muchsupport here you can see that they havethese full cups that you can wear so Ifind that actually having cups reallyhelps with the support I feel like itkind of pushes all your girls inside sowhen you're jumping around it doesn'tlike jump around with you and then ithas sports bra like it has a built inbra hmm all their or all the things thatI have always have a built in bra sothat's nice and then it's like this soit's very slimming too when you wear itbecause the black on the outsides of itand then it has the racerback with theinsignia fun is probably my leastfavorite item from Lululemon it's theirtanks that have this kind of cut in thefront I don't know what it is I don'treally like this cut and it kind ofmakes my boobs look a little bit too bigfor exercising purposes um I mean it sodon't okay tank but I think this isprobably the most unflattering on me itlooks a little bit boyish and then theback it has mesh here so I mean just theway it's designed is really great it hasmesh here which keeps you cool becauseusually sweat right hereas nice Jersey mesh and then the logoright here and then this tank is when Iactually got from traipse and it's likea ballet tank so it's a lot of straps alot of straps action going on it's nicebecause it it's tight around the bustbut then it flares out so if you do havea little bit of a pooch it kind ofcovers that and all the seams and thefabric is really nice and it has theLululemon thing on here I've beensearching for a really great gym bagsand the gym bag requirement that I needis because the locker is at my gym arevery skinny and tall I need a verticalnorth-south bag not like a duffle bagthat goes this way so this is the intakehobo bag it is completely sold out it islike this and I really do like it I'llshow you what it looks like on like thatit is highlighter yellow which colorneon green which I really do likebecause it's obnoxious and that's justwho I amso it has mesh pockets in the frontwhich I love because mesh pockets aregreat to see you know what you have inhere without digging through it andthese zippers are really really thickagain detailing of Lululemon there isthis plaid insert here and then theselike little braid zippers here and thenin the back there's a huge mesh pocketin the back on the sides of the bagthere's like these drawstring so youcan't really create it very tight or notthere's no zipper in the front but thereis a magnetic button closure so all youritems will remain in here and you canwear this bag with the hobo strap or youcan wear it like as a tote so you canjust put it like thisso you can wear either way as a shoulderbag or that bottom flap lining it isplaid lining inside and in here there'sone large pocket it says my favoriteastana is savasana and then in herethere is a nylon pouch so you can putall your dirty clothes in here which isnice because what I usually do from thegym is I throw all my dirty workerclothes in a bag and then I will just atthe end of that week dump that in thewash and then it comes with a nettedpouch like this and even the fan to thezipper hazel and Signia on here just Imean it's just a really great bag againthe detailing of Lululemon is justamazing so if you're really into workingout this is definitely great actuallygym bags are something that you reallyneed a good gym bag with a lot ofpockets because when you're in the gymyou have like a lot of different thingsI know for me when I'm in the gym Ishower and sometimes I will do a fullface makeup and my hair depending whereI'm going like sometimes I'll go to thegym and then I have a event to go towhere I need to look presentable so Ibring my whole thing in makeup and it'snice to have a lot of compartments and Ifeel like this bag could be great asalmost like a work or a computer bag youknow like you could put a laptop in hereand like store the chargers and stuff soyou can really see where everything isI'm not a huge fan of the white handlesto be honest but I wanted to get the onein black they were all sold out and theone in floral print is actually sold outnow but I actually really like the neonprint I just wish that the handles arenot white I'm not a huge fan of that youall so much for watching and I hope youlearned something in this video and letme know what your favorite item fromLululemon is don't forget to like thisvideo so so I'll see you guys later byeyou,26,UCLfpBAyfXl_2VTMigDlGonA,THE ACNE CHANNEL,10,15,0,50,"['daiserz89', 'perfect beauty',

hi I'm Morgan and I'm here with Ben pansloth to talk about Lululemon so I'mMorgan Rabyand the ways I like to workout I loveyoga I call myself a fair-weather runnerI just took a two-hour spin class todayand my butt kind of hurts but that wasfun so I I like to venture out tryanything so how did you get to where youare at today in Lululemon and what yourposition is I started as a seasonaleducator backlast Christmas so last October I startedthere after holiday was done I went onand became part time and then I bumpedthem enough that they let me gofull-time and then after that I am now akey leader which is a step right belowthe assistant managers if you coulddescribe Lululemon's culture what wouldyou say their cultures fun it'sdifferent than anything else I've everexperiencedI love the educator and guestsinteraction I love how unique we canmake our store feel compared toeverywhere else very good what is thebest part about working in theenvironment that I wouldn't be able tosee just walking around in the storeit's definitely the relationships youcan make it's so different how there'snever any drama if you have a problemwith someone you just go right up tothem and tell them what your problem isalso just getting out and sweating inthe community is a way that we like todiffer our selves so that what is thebest part about your jobabout not dreading going in I neverdread going into work and if I dothere's always somebody that I can goand talk to and be like this is why I'mdreading going into workI never feel stressed out about it Ialso like I just said I love that we geta sweat in the community so like againtoday they asked me if I'm go to thisspin class and I just if you tell me gowork out I'll go work out so that'sdefinitely my favorite fine so wementioned three goals are three corevalues of Lululemon and Morgan mentionedentrepreneurship setting goals andsupporting the employees so how do youshowcase these on a daily basis atLululemon well start withentrepreneurship it's definitely you areyour own like business owner so ifyou're back in pants for the day and youdon't like how something is merged orlaid out you have every opportunity inthe world to switch it around you canalso if the guest walks into the storeand they ask if you can if they can seethe manager you are more than you willalmost get in trouble if you don't saythat you're the manager and that you canhelp them so basically you're your ownmanager and you can help guests with anyproblem you can do whatever you see fitfor the store whatever's going to helpthe store in the long run and then goalsour store or just Lululemon in generalis so they love goals basically I wouldalways say we have a high turnover rightbecause people come into the store towork and you're told you're giving likecoaching to do your goals and that'sjust bizarre and people don't even knowlike we're gonna be in five years Idon't know so it almost gets you tothink about it and it's scary but youfigure out what you want to do and howthebut he can support you and no one isever gonna like not how you just becauseyou're like oh I want to move to Texasin a year and then they would definitelyhire you if you're gonna support thecompany no matter what so and then thelast one supporting what you wanted todo oh yeah so like what I just said Imean the company is all for seeing yougrow in your life wherever you want togo whether it be with the company or ifnot it's it can be a stepping stone intosomething different it can be a steppingstone into a different position thecompany is just there to support youmaybe the love so is that what makesLululemon different ordefinitely that's what makes a littleoven different is the goals and theculture but one of my favorite partsthat makes it different is just theexperience that you get walking into thestore and like we want to know what yourname is we want to know what you like todo to work out we want to know what theheck you're doing todayso like you walk into target and Ialmost get sad now when people don'twant to know what I'm doing for the dayor what what am I out shopping for orwhat do I like to do work out so Idefinitely say that in-store experienceis one of the biggest differences alsowe have just this last week last Mondaytwo designers came down from Vancouverto Omaha Nebraska and we had breakfastwith them it was the head design forwomen's yoga and then it was also thehead design for the new on the go or nowhat's it called yeah something like onthe go and so they came from Vancouverto Omaha to hear what we had to say sothey wanted to know what do you guyswant for next spring and we were likePearlie you're asking us this so that'sdefinitely what makes the companydifferent too is you can talk to anybodyabout anything and one of the girls thatwe had breakfast with one of myco-workers she was like I want your joband how didyou get there and what can I do to getyour job so we're very open abouteverything and as it doesn't the twobiggest differences company so if therewas one thing that you could changeabout Lululemon what would that be um Imean the one thing I would change Idon't really like the cold so I wouldmove the SSC or the like headquarterssomewhere warmer so I could work there Imean I don't know it's such a coolcompany that I haven't found anythingthat I would want to change yet in allhonesty it just keeps growing andexpanding and I mean we're opening ourfirst store and London this month so Ifeel like everything is just on theup-and-up and I don't think I'd

I oh I just get stabbed so about fiveyears ago I was teaching in anelementary school and for a variety ofreasons I was really really unhappy andI had already done a yoga teachertraining I was already invested in dailyyoga classes at four-thirty and and Ihad a pivotal moment in my in my housewhen my husband who was my boyfriend atthe time and he said we're not doingthis next year we're not doing this andI quit my job almost immediately andfrom that point was when I think goldstudy became a part of my life and Iwasn't yet apart of lululemon culture orat least maybe I wasn't aware that I wasa part of it and I started this processof creating a thousand things and so thefirst thing that I created was yoga foryoung warriors and it is my heart it isthe place where my elementary schoolteaching merged with my love of yoga andpassion for our future and and I'vestarted that business and I started iton my own and I went into schools andand it was fabulous and then some reallybeautiful people trusted me and they letme teach yoga two adults shortly afterthat it's true she's in here but someonetrusted me and and so then I created athousand other lofty goals in relationto that and I started teaching spin andI was teaching sculpting I was teachingkids yoga and I was um I mean I was likedoing 100 thousand things and I thinkthe really big thing for me and takingadvantage of lululemon as part of mymunity was that I was living my goals ina space of not being enough alwaysthinking that I needed to tell somebodyI was going to do something bigger andbetter than the last thing I had toldthem like when I couldn't just be okayin my own skin and I had to be like ohwhen are you going to do in retreat whenare you going to do a teacher trainingwhen are you gonna and and coming intoLulu actually open my eyes and thisincredible opportunity to consider whatI want ten years from now and when Iclose my eyes I want a simple anddrama-free life maybe it's in a reallybeautiful place and it's when somereally incredible people but no longerdo I permit myself to think that I'm notenough and lululemon really really wasis the backbone of that is realizingthat I have a support system and I don'tneed to go searching and grasping forthe next big thing that's going to makesomebody go holy Kristin how do youdo it all I don't know I'm really tiredand so when these things come to meopportunities whether they'reparticipating in a teacher training orspeaking at something like this orjoining someone for a coffee I think isthis in alignment with who I want to be10 years from now and if it is theanswer is always yes it's always yes andif it's not because I set these goalsand because I know what I want in thefuture and it's simple and drama-free Istuff away because that is also I thinka big part of goal setting is like whatisn't in alignment where am I using myit's not serving me I think a lot ofpeople whose haven't a lot of people youhave a good example might see that's theother thing that I'm so glad you guysare here I'm just going to try not tocry the next thing after I write downwhat it is that I envisioned and when Iset my goals the next thing I do is Itrust I saw a really funny comedy piecerecently where where they were makingfun they were playing fun wantingsomething in your life like setting agoal and it's kind of like the kid inthe car in the back seat who's like arewe there yet are we there yet are wethere yet am i living in steamboat am iliving in steamboat are we in steamboatyet are we in sumo you ask once and thenyou trust forever right and it just sortof unfolds and I don't know that in Ithink maybe what I bring to thelululemon culture that maybe we lemonbecause they're a company camp ring isthis really in a strong sense of God ofGod of something bigger going on thenwhether or not I the next goal happensfor me right whether or not I take fiveyoga classes a week if I don't whathappens only took four I didn't mean tomy mad at all this week this is not theend of the world the world is actuallyworking in my favor in your favor and sothe faith is a huge part of how i dothis whole thing I think Kristin was umlet a leadership thing in ourdevelopment days for all the storemanagerscompany in the southwest and we had somehuge learnings just from her speakingand I think I'd love for you to speak tohow we were in that space of settingthese goals of like I run threemarathons and lalala that's because whatyou that's what yes it's almost likelooking good thing and as opposed to Ijust have dinner my husband it's yeah ohyes it is so one of the things that'spart of the lulav your goal settingstructure is making your voice carrythat they should be bigger than youthink audacious audacious thank you umand what scariest for me is not pickingup my phone first thing in the morningand logging into facebook what'sscariest for me is thinking oh my goshwhat's somebody going to think if Idon't show up on my mat instead I sharea conversation with somebody that I loveand and for me my goals now especiallythe stuff that's 10 years out is thereabout simplicity about doing a littlebit less I think it's so easy in thisculture to think that we need toconstantly do more constantly do moreand instead leaning into the communitythat you have and sharing really tenderand sweet heartfelt moments it's whereit's at for me and I do think it's scaryfor most of us it's scary for us todisconnect from or to connect more fullyinto how am I engaged with the person infront of me rather than do I have threemore friend requests because I spoketoday this thing right there dang reallypresent is scarier for me and I work onevery day awesome what about that quoteI feel like it's a little overrated okso the globe is be more interested thaninteresting try to live your life beingone and interesting does anyone have anyquestions for Kristen Thanks I got thatfrom the Today Show happy Liam hodenwhile they were drinking are youdrinking

ddr detonation whohas a question for Christie what's yourname Jessica Jessica hi just cut aperson but alsofamily about goal setting is kind ofcoming to realizations that you weren'texpecting and I think especially personlike coming from something that's a morei would say lack of better term like atraditional job type and then all of asudden realizing no i'm going to dosomething at the out of the box with theoriginal how did you deal with theemotions with kind of taking that stepand jumping into something so I'mstructured so your question is like whenI made the leap into yoga how I dealtwith the fear of you know like I i Ijust I cannot tell you how much thepeople in my life have made a differencein my ability to be career courageouswhether it was the person who asked meto teach giving me as many opportunitiesas they could to grow and be better orthe people who I came home to and comehome to still who remind me on myhardest days that I live a very blessedlife I live a very blessed life and andwhen I stop and sit in gratitude forwhat I have it's a much much easier tojust sort of soften into your goalsrather than force into them have any youthree had that same idea okay I

hey everyone its Lisa happy Friday toyou and I have seen you a few times thisweek so today I am going to show youwhat I got this week and I got some goodstuff so I let's see I got some makeupand then I have some skincare that Iwanted to show you and some clothes andokay I'll just start off just withwhat's here I just ran out of Myra fisaand I don't know if you guys remember Idid a video when I got it and it wasprobably alright to look and just see ifI can find it in for the date right herebut it was probably two years ago or soif not more that I bought Myra fisa forthe first time and I bought it from Annabody rep and I didn't know that it wasaffiliated with apology but evidently itis if you can see that it's got a bodyon it and so I ran out and I had justsqueezed every little bit out of thattube that I could and because of that Iwas not using as much and I could reallysee a difference in my skin it isamazing what this stuff does so I boughtum a new tube which is much smaller andwhen I said something about I said yeahmy tube was big and she says yeah that'swhen they first came out with it and youwere getting a tube and a half orsomething but I mean my other two wasprobably double this but it is the bestit is the tretinoin cream emollient0.05% and i use this I wash my face atnight first I take off my makeup withBioderma then I wash my face with Dovesoap and then I put the retinol eyecream that I showed you guys a couplevideos back under my eyes and I put thison my skin and it's not the easiest tospread because it's kind of thick andyou'll see you'll understand if you useit but you just have to kind of work itinto your skin and then spread it and itis amazing it does amazing things itkeeps you from getting anyit just evens your skin tone it's justit's the best thing for aging skin andacne but it is prescription so I don'tfeel like I'm gonna get anybody to runout and get it so you do have to speakto someone to get it we just happen tohave a physician's assistant there atthe Med spot that I go to which is whyit's a Med Spa so you can get stuff likethis so love that I've had it now acouple of nights and I feel like I canalready see a difference I've had it Ithink I've used it three or four nightsthis week and I could already tell I wasgetting like just little uneven bumpsright here and right in here and they'rejust like gone so oh and I wanted tomention to you if you're someone who hasnot been able to use a retin-a or youknow tretinoin cream I started off withI believe skin suta khals the 1% that Ihad to go down to the 5% then I triedthe at Rowland and I could just not useit it was so strong it was making myskin just almost have wounds I mean justchunks of my skin we're coming off itwas terrible I hate to be gross but ifyou've been through it you know how itis and this is when I first startedusing the Obagi nu-derm system and itwas to the point I couldn't use it andit's a really a vital part of thatsystem because it helps your skin cellsregenerate and it takes thathydroquinone which is one of the mainreasons you get on the neutering systemis to get rid of dark patches it takesthat deep into the skin and so youreally need to be able to use that andyou mix it with the blender and this isthe best this is the only thing I havefound that does not dry my skin out sobad and doesn't hurt my skin now it doescause it like when I was putting mymakeup on I could feel it was a littlesensitive and flaky and that's anotherthinguse your Clarisonic with it that nextthing I got this week was this Too Facedeyeliner and it's just the black one theperfect guys waterproof eyeliner and Ithink I heard Michelle from the mmm andL show mentioned this and then candyCandy's makeup or you know candy thatdoes makeup onhere she was using it the other day andso I decided to get it and try itbrooke has taken off with a lot of mineand it is very similar to the YSL that'swhat I would say it's the most similarto it's a real soft one and it goes onlike liquid I used it today and I use ityesterday I still have not put themakeup I used yesterday but that's whatI used was this and what you do it's oneof those that you put on pretty thickand then you take your angled brush anddo the little wing and I even if I needsome more I'll take the brush on hereand do it and it lasts all day I mean itreally did last and it was pretty easyto take off so it's really neat and itcomes with a little smudge on the endthat I have not used but it looks like anice one nicer than the usual it'sshaped a little different I don't haveto use that see how it goes maybe if I'mnot doing too much of a wing usuallywhen I'm doing a wing I want something alittle bit more precise but I reallylike that and they had some other colorsso I might give those a try like thebrown so that's one thing that I got itultra and then I told you guys that Ilove the Revlon lip butter and I can'tremember the name right now is thatlight peachy one and while I'm wantingto say guava but it's not guava but I'llput the name down here and then I happento a lot of times you know I'll becauseI don't have as much time to watchvideos plus I am just addicted toPinterest trying to say that rightPinterest and so I ended up clicking onone of Lorraine the current customsvideos other day it was a haul which Ilove Lorraine's hauls that I used towatch her before I even made videos andI loved all the stuff she got and one ofthe things that she got was this and Ihave gone to get this quad how manytimes it is Chanel and it is mystic eyesI believe yes mystic eyes and I thinkevery time I go I end up something elsejust looks a little bit better to me andso yesterday I wason a mission I went and bought it andI've got it on today and I loved it atfirst I thought ooh because I used thiscolor as my all over not my all over butmy lid or my crease color which is whatI start off with and normally I don'tlike it that dark and I thought oh Idon't know form I like this and then Ihave used every one of these colors andI finished off with that darkest colorwith a thin Louise Young brush in thecrease just to deepen it some and Iloved it so I'm glad I got it and I cansee why this is so popular because it'skind of I know it's very neutral it'snot too warm and it's not too cool and Ithink it's gonna be fun to use thatdarkest color all over so I'm gonna havefun with it and I'm glad I got it so Ibought that and when I was at Chanel Igot a sample that I was excited to get Ilove this bag it's a nice one and it isthe new mascara which I've never beencrazy about Chanel mascaras because theyusually run on me but I'm gonna givethis one a try probably on the weekendon a day that I don't wear my lashes Iswear putting on lashes is just so mucheasier it's so much easier and it is somuch easier to take off that I am sospoiled so I have not been wearingmascara on my top lashes just enough alot of times I'll just put the UrbanDecay super curl on the bottom and thenI'll just finish off the top with it toobecause I've got to put a little bit toblend my lashes in with the lashes justbecause mine are lighter but um thislooks really promising it's got the kindof brush that I like and it seems tohave a lot on the wand so I'm gonna giveit a good try this weekend and see howit goes I was excited to get this samplebecause I might I might would havebought it just to try because I've heardso much good stuff about it so with thatand then I was thinking when I wasgetting ready I was like gosh did I notbuy any lip products except for thoselip butters and I did but it was arefill I've got it on today it is thewhen I got my hair done last night Ibought the YSL number 17 glossy lipstain because that's one of my favoritesand they told me they were discontinuingit and mine was just about gone sothat's what I have on over the candyRose lip liner by Dior which is just ifI could just recommend three we see fourlip liners it would be deep they wouldall be Dior because they last thelongest and when you get used to usingthem you don't want to use anything elsebecause you realize how much betterthese last on your lips I would getcandy Rose linen earth or terracotta andsparkling beige I think you could wearthose with anything even if you were towear red if you were to do the sparklingbeige you could get away with thatbut I've never tried their red so Idon't know maybe that's a good one toget but those are just good lip linersso I'm gonna put this up so I can do newclothes it's going to be all over theplace but first of all I've got these ontoday the ones that I bought last weekthe corral kind of like two-tone jeanstoday I've got on the ones that areblack and grey and I told you I hadordered these and I think I got them Idon't know early in the week eitherSaturday or Monday but this is the otherpair of ordered and I'm not upset that Igot two pair of because these are sodifferent but these are the ones thatare black and brown and I love them justso different and I just think they'regonna look so good I would not reallytry to match them you know per say Iwouldn't wear a brown sweater we're ablack sweater but something evensomething grey or a I think what wouldlook the best would be just a graphictee or something like that somethingkind of funky but um and they're skinnyjeans and like I said I've got them ontodayso you can see you know what they looklike on but on I just really like I'm Ithink they're neat so I haven't reallybeen into jeans as much lately justbecause I've been loving my leggings andleggings are just so comfortable butI've been Halley king of leggings I gotmy Lululemon Wonder unders and let's seeI think it was Monday or Tuesday that Idecided to wear them and got them outand looked at him and I thought hmm ImeanI ordered the eight and I wasn't surebecause I'm not I'm so so in between a 4and a 6 and everyone told me to order upand then some people said that I didn'thave to order up that there were priestswrong anyway I had ordered an 8 and whenI took them out I figured you know theymight be a little bit big but I lovethis is right off the bat what I can seeis different it's look how they alreadyhave kind of like a shape to your legand contoured and so you see it rightthereoh the calf is kind of already shapedand when I put them on they're notreally tight they're not really likethey don't they're where these aresupposed to be like compression leggingsand they're not compression but not likethe Spanx were that's for sure so Iordered these six which I feel probablyare going to fit better but once I putthese on I could not bear to take themoff they felt so good and so what Ithought is if I give the six and I thinkit fits they're so much better I mightjust put these on my website but if thenthe six doesn't fit any better I'll justsend the sixes back and keep these butthey're just not tight and they kind ofalmost wrinkle up on my legs and I don'tthink they're supposed to fit that waybut I can see why you guys like themthey're so pretty they have such a goodSheen to them so much better much muchbetter than these Spanx so loving themand there's the little thing I don'treally get you have to tell me what theconcept is why would you okay thesearen't but some of them I think thezoella's are reversible and I don't knowwhy you would care why you would want areversible legging I can't imagine doingthat but anyway and these have thelittle pocket right here in case you arereally working out going to the gym orsomething you need to put something inthere or sometimes like if I walk theloop which I haven't done in a long timeI need to that would be good to put mykeys or whatever so love those andseveral of you had asked me about theare they they're not hanky panky butYummie Tummie leggings that you hadheard good things about those and barenecessities had a 25% off and freeshipping sale so I did order the youngtommy's just to try them and comparethem and I'll let you know and I stillwouldn't mind trying the compressionleggings from Old Navy because a lot ofyou have you know been breaking on thoseand probably what I'll do is all of mylife my I NC leggings and some otherones that I have I might end up puttingthose on my website if any of you guysare interested I need to do that thisweekend and see what I've gotokay and then I went to Target this weekI had to get something there cannotremember now what it was I know I had toget glad I thought this I had to get wetcat food because Bubba's medicine forhis sneezes is a liquid I have to givehim one milliliter and so a lot of youhave suggested those pill pockets whichwouldn't work I wish I kind of wish itwas a pill because they have those pillpopper things that are pretty easy forcats but this is the liquid and when youtry it the first night I've tried tojust open his mouth and put it in therebut he just bugged out and now wheneverI even get close to his mouth he freaksout so I've just been taking it thefirst day I put it in a little bit ofyou know wet cat food and put it onthere and he didn't eat all of it sothat kind of freaked me out so the pasttwo days I've just been taking theliquid out of the wet cat food andputting it in there and he's been eatingit but he's still sneezing so I don'tknow I hope it works he's supposed totake it for five days once a day andthen every other day until it's gone sowe'll see how it goesanyway I had gone to Target and that dayI also bought I wanted to try a newkitty litter because the one I had wasreally dusty and I bought the world'sbest kitty litter which is like a cornmeal type kitty litter and Bridgetstarted eating it I have a zoo aroundhere so all of you out there with catslet me know what kitty litter you usedand what's a good one I ended up justmoving that litter box upstairs inBrookes room and just the one downstairsis just regular kitty litter but I wantto change that so let me know but anywaythey had some good sweaters of courseand I grabbed this one I just I love thedifferent texturesthe gray in the middle and then the kindof Raglan sleeve or whatever and I lovethe gray this color gray with thepleather like the leggings I

blush color and theseare $19.99 and they're just the high-lowshaker knit sweaters and they're not perse off the shoulder but I bet of courseyou'll cut this this is just for thehanger I bet once you wear it and if youget a large I think I've held up thelarge and extra-large and there was ermm right much right much right muchdifference I can't remember I didn't getthe extra large must have been a reasonbecause I usually compare themmaybe the extra-large wasn't any longerbut that's usually what I'm trying to doso I love this I just love the color andlet me see if it gives the case you wantI don't think it was available onlinewhat color it is it's called honey isthe color and so got that and then I gotI want to tell you about this - I boughtBrooke and my youngest niece thesereally pretty

thereyou know right in there with the sweaterso make sure you look at those becausethey're really pretty I think they'reeight dollars so there's a real nice andthen I got some really good stuffyesterday when I went into Belk and Ifeel bad that all of you do not have abelts department store because theythey're the best to me I mean I reallydo wish I had a Macy's or aNordstrom we had amazing one time and itwasn't that great but I wish we had aNordstrom or something like that butBelk is really good because they'vegotten better and better about carryinggood brands and they have the

saveso much moneyyou must be one of my other or maybe inmy purse but anyway it was anotherthirty percent off of that and so Ithink I ended up getting it for oh Ican't remember it was cheap and it isone of these big sweater II Poncho's seehow its rounded at the bottom and thenit has the toggle clasp which really isdips so let me sip it up and show youand I just love all the Michael Korsstuff because I love all this hardwareand then it has this nice little thinghere and then your arms are like that soit is like a poncho sweater and I justthink that would look so good with myleggings that I

this and theywere having an even that was the salealready for clearance and then they werehaving another sale for Thursday andFriday which was an extra 20% off but itwas only on things that weren't

even knew it was theadditional but it's just a big sloppysweater and I love the sleeves I lovehow they're kind of fitted and hereagain I knew this would look good withleggings or black skinny jeans

is okay this is a large and it wasregularly 89 and see it wasn't markeddown so I remember asking her and hadbeen marked down so when she took thesale price that ended up being 50something and then I

Washington Avenue I'll putthe name down here but I love it it'skind of like a deep has a little bit ofa powdery scent to it just somethinggood and different and I think that's itoh my hair so I got my hair done lastnight and I was not feeling goshChanel's up there let me get a realquick before she knocks something I'mgoing to tell you a funny story aboutChanel last night I was sitting at mycomputer and all of a sudden out of myback bedroom I was sewing room cameflying out a paper bag and it was an airparcel bag and Chanel had been goingthrough my stuff in that room and whenshe was in the bag but when she came outher head got caught in that little hadone of those like twine handles and soshe just came flying out into thekitchen so I felt so sorry for I ranover and reached down to get her out andwhen I did I didn't realize that I bentright under it still so sore bent underthe edge of my countertop and said whenI came up I just hit that corner of thecountertop and it just like you knowthat pain like when you just feel it inyour gut and you just feel like thatoh god that's gonna leave a mark yousure enough I had a mark but then I showyou the picture I took a picture then assoon as that happened here comes Bubbajumping right in that berry bag and hestarts ripping it up piece by piece andmy nerves were just shot by that point Ireached over and tried to pour him outand I mean he literally just felt rolledout he wouldn't evenout of it so these cats I swear never adull moment and thanks for all youradvice on the Christmas tree the bestadvice I think so far well I'm not goingto use nutmeg some I said not to do thatso I won't but I liked the cinnamon pinecone idea and also I like the idea ofputting it up and letting it sit therefor a little bit and just seeing howthey react to it and then someone saidyou get an alarm to it which and I knowspray bottle won't work so they laughedat that they just lick that right upthey say thanks for the bath spray spraybottle anyway so I think that's it and Ihope you guys have a wonderful weekendoh my hair sorry I ramble too much um soa whinnying I told her I had not beenjust I really wasn't happy with how darkit was to how light I mean I realizedwhat we were doing was what I wanted todo and everything and so what she did isinstead of doing just a base break at myroots she actually used a permanentcolor which was great because it made itlike a warmer tone and it covered myGray's I was getting you know right manyGray's coming in and so it covered thosewhich the base break didn't all the basebreak did was basically lift my owncolour but it did not deposit the sameamount of color but this did so you cansee it's just a warmer I think nicerlook and it goes better with my eyebrowsand stuff like that at first I told herI was thinking about going all dark Isaid I mean like Megan Fox dark andeverybody said they wouldn't do it shesaid girl we'll have to talk you off thebridge so do you think it would bedrastic but one day I

alright that was the advanced version ofthis week's sandbag workout now if yousaw last week's video with Kern we bothare using the same sandbag I just tookout 20 pounds so now my sandbag that I'musing because I'm on a a muscle womanI'm not using 40 pounds yeah I'm goingusing 20 so it's great for those of youwho are you know at various stages inyour workout program the nice thingabout a sandbag is that it's removableliterally all right so if you open itlike like so you'll see that inside iswhere have waiting part this is theprices in here loose and or you can useright I believe Mike's weights work soright les okay so right waist left thisright here with the sandbag is 20 poundsif you want to up it you can always addanother Sande which we have stored awayand the roughest 40 pounds which whather knees okay so anybody I demonstrateit for you the advanced version thefirst exercise that we did in this setwas a mountain climber flip with thearms okay so I guess for theintermediate version what you would dois you would just probably use somedumbbell dumbbells anywhere from 5 to 15pound weights you would just come downinto that mountain climber position mostof you will do your mouth with my mercywith your by each leg okaythen you would hop it in grab yourdumbbells and you can just curl theminto your chest so you could do an armcurl maybe a hammer curl leaning withyour thumbs back down drop the weightshop out back- okay now if you're extremely new tothe - exercising and so you would be youknow a newbie with us no problem whatyou would do is grab the mooing amountof migrants you could just do a pullingso all chaining me tuck okay and that'sa little too hard grief still you canjust rest one meat and just pull in onone side okay four five then rest theother need extend on the other side andpull in four five on this side and thenwhat you want to come back up again Imean either hop in and stand okay or ifyou don't feel comfortable at the hopyou can just block yourself back inmaking sure you bet your knees so youdon't hurt your back and stand and thereyou want and then you can do your curlsat the top or if you don't usually it'sno problem you can just do a shorterrace with no weights okay that's thefirst move okay the second move so theycan remember for honor back we did thesandbag overhead into the stands and hopokay so what you would do again is justif you don't have a sandbag you wouldjust grab your dumbbells come all theway flat bring you there one or twodumbbells overhead pull it back up sixokay and then if ten pull your knees inand how about like I said which isprobably a little advanced for you ifyou're just starting out or you're notto advance in your program so if that'stoo hard for you you can just pull upokay sit updrop the weights to the side push offwith your hands and huh or you can justskip the hop and just and come back downtouch your hands to the mat lower yourbutt come all the way backgrab your dumbbells overhead extendagain and then sit okay or no wait it'stoo hardfor you not the weights if you have themagain push off the next to the lastsequence and our last exercise in thestat today we did open and closed whatwould you call that current yep yeahokay so I use the dump of this handbagand you had the sandbag I'm gonna sendit over hand and I race up and I loweredokay now you can obviously do this withweights same thing it's just a distanceif it's too hard for you to lower yourlegs without touching the ground if youstart to feel a strain your lower backthat's fine you can actually lower soyou touch the ground before you comeback up okay or if that's still too hardfor you can still feel pain in your backjust take your palms press them onthrough the base of your back okay rightabove your bum so that when you loweryou have added support there okay sothen you would just do your leg raisesyou would forget the arms comingoverhead alright so again you can alwaysuse your dumbbells or if you don't andyou're you know you're completely new toexercise it feel free to drop theweights altogether and just use your ownbody weight it's all about that gettingthe body moving and your own body weightis resistance to so it's just one stepat a timeokay so that's the set for today nowI'll be wearing I have on my new fairfit shoes these are really comfortableI mean I had a blog post about this Ithink it was like a week and a

hi everyone and welcome back to mychannel so today I'm gonna do a video onwhat's in my makeup bag so I have mymakeup bag here it's a bag that I takewith me everywhere I go could you touchups it is pretty big you know it's apretty big one so it's not one thatreally fits in my purse it's one that Ikind of just roll my on my passenger carseat and take with me so this is alululemon makeup bag I did get it forchristmas i believe it is 58 sixtydollars but i won't link it down belowso that you guys can see what it is fullso it is a big big guy it's good fortravel because i love that it opened upso wide I find with so many makeup bagsthat it only opens up like a smidge andthen I can't like get in there and dowhat I have in there so with this I findthat I use a lot of my products becauseI open it so big and so wide so Ihaven't been through this in a littlewhile and i don't i'm not positive ofwhat what all is in here but it's allnecessity so all things that I use allthe time so if you want to see what's inmy makeup bag then go ahead and keep onwatching the very first thing I see hereis this clear pouch it's just full oflipstick so I find with these know whenyou get 100 point perks at sephora oryou get your birthday gift or somethingi always throw these in here so there'slike the little NARS one this is my likea clearing what is it cold Clarenceinstant light I love these so all ofthese are very neutral colors becausewhen I'm on the go I don't want like ared or something I want to go with likea neutral this is a buxom menace so it'sa little mini guy and I have two ofthese so I do love thee if but i did buytwo of them as the sephora perk it isthe makeup forever in 3c it's a nicelook like i don't know why i have two ofthem in here but that i do so it's justlike a neutral lip that's going to gowith everything so two of them next theyhave an arse this is the lip pencil aswell and red eyes can see if it I havelike a lip gloss kind of go with it thisis the hourglass is a little mini one Idid get a lipset from Sephora of a bunch of mini lipproducts that's where a lot of thesehave came from as well it's goodnormally I don't grab for my minis whenI'm at home but when I'm on the go it'ssomething that i can grab easy so NYXbutter gloss this is in Madeline I havelots of these as well so very neutralcolor Mark Teague APSA switzer lastyear's birthday little lipstick and kisskiss bang bang so this one's a reallyneutral color I love that one sephoraliquid lip stain in red I love this aswell so this is a benefit a posy bomb itsmells so good kind of sounds like Idon't know watermelon or peaches somekind of fruit and it is just really softand hydrating so I love these I have themonth like one of those everywhere whichis a little sephora mere a bare mineralslike compact powder finding all types ofnew things in here what is this one MakeUp For Ever this is a little minilipstick as well not positive where Igot this in n 9 so very neutral shade aswell a tart this is like a chubby stickI don't love this one so it's a verylast bottoms watch there it's like aberry color but it is more of like ahydrating lip anivia this is like a lipbalm baby lips I love this one as welloh it expires too good to know um sothis one is I don't know what color it'slike the nude color so it's againsomething that's very hydrating that youcan just throw on it's the last one inthe swatches all you can barely see itjust because it is very neutral lot oflip products and then I have a Make UpFor Ever little lip gloss this one is in100 p just a very neutral color lookanother Posey bomb and the last two lipproducts here so I have a bite lipstickthis isn't a very bright pink sodefinitely good to have something likethis on the go if I want to change apilot from a neutral color to more oflike a bright color and then I haveanother pink one this one is the lipfusion so it's a plumper I don't thinkis this one before and it is in babydollso these are all little mini guy some ofthem all back in here so the next thingI see here it's just a little deodorantso it's happy time the vo deodorantdefinitely one that I really like workswell for me and I have it in my makeupbag just in case I forget so next issome hand lotion so this one first oneis that I believe it's the body shop andI love this hand lotion because it driesso quickly so you know when you put on ahand lotion and it's super tacky thisone does not so a good hand cream againthis one's from costco so this one isthe twenty percent shea butter and it isby L'Occitane instead of loccitane so alittle bit of like a knockoff but I lovethese little lotions here some expel gumanother lotion is the French lavenderand honey from Bath and Body Works thisis a nice like small travel side oh itsmells good too this one's more so likejust like a summary fresh scent a littlemac fix+ I could always use this alittle mini one phone the go a few pensand pencils and then this is theseven-year pen so this one's really coolI have one of these in my purse and oneof them might make a baked as well sodependences last seven years so we'llsee um a few eyelash curler is notpositive why I have to this one sallyhansen and this one's quote was so iknow the quote one works really wellstory if you are birthing hadn'tanything to pick up quo that quote oneworks really nicely um they're realmascara after i have gotten my falseflashes or my logic sentence off Ihaven't been loving this mascara I knowbefore I got lost your senses I reallyloved it but right now it kind of clingson to the broken areas of my lashes so Iwouldn't recommend this if you havefresh off flashes from lash extensionsor your damaged eyelashes but other thanthat for healthy lashes it really makesa difference in the length and volume ofthe lashesso I have a few little roller balls I'vebeen really into rule or both lightlyjust because I never find myself easingup a whole bottle of perfume I thinklike Nicki Minaj is the only bottleperfume I've actually used up the entirething so definitely something toconsider if you want to try a fewdifferent signs the kate spade it's livecolorfully is definitely one of myfavorites oh it smells so good it's solike professional but but fruity at thesame time and it lasts so long the scenton your body as well as like this twobits I think it's our two Christmasesago and I'm only not even halfway doneso this is last a long time and the nextis Bobby Brown beach so this is always asuccessful one as well it's kind ofstuff it just smells like sunscreen andlike if you're on vacation so sunscreenand sand and unlike having a picnic onvacation that's what this reminds me ofso I love that one um it's more of asummer scent though so I haven't boughtthe full bottle just cuz I wouldn't useit year-round one more lip product thisis the Clarence there's like the limitededition lip balm it does look like it'skind of peachy clear but when you put iton it goes really pink on me anyways Ithink it's different on everyone but onme this one goes really pink so it iscalled jelly bomb another pen so thissounds like it's just a shape of alipstick I did get a few of these for agift one year um some nail clipperslittle mini guys here some flaws so Ishould really start using that I went tothe dentist stain and I should really beusing more flaws so it definitely soundsgood to keep out I'm to consider usingit a little this is just like an eyelashbrush so when I had logic Center I usedto like brushed on my wash extensionsnow I kind of just brush of mascarasthere's any clumps in the mascara withthose wands so next is a makeup foreverthis one is their compact powder um thepro finish in 117 so I think it's likethe lightest and I've hit count on thisbut it's good just to clean up my nosearea because my nose is always the firstthing to come off when I do travel or Iam on thego my nose is always the first thing tocome off so that's it that's all that'sin my makeup bag I love that it's so biglike I said and it's just so nice itsays sweat today strong tomorrow andthen there's a place for bobby pins andhair ties it says um yeah so it doeshave like a little pocket on the backhere with the zipper and then it lookslike a pocket on the front but it'sactually not a pocket there and you cankind of see all the pockets inside but Ilove this because look at look how easyit does up don't have to worry but likesnagging and catching on anything zipperso heavy duty and thick so I do lovethis guy like i said i will link it downbelow for you guys just in case you wantto check it out

stuff you like better weather likelookbooks or outfit of the days or whatbut I will definitely put some videoscoming soon so you can see how some ofthis stuff I would style it okay so nowthat i've officially talked for four anda half minutes about nothing Ithis is like our checking guys thisisn't me just saying hey because it'sbeen a little bit since I've been oncamera to say hey so yeah I'm just twoguys like honestly I find so much funputting up videos and like getting toput more of my personality in them and Ijust think they'll be really fun to lookback on like years from now and see likehow far I've come and just the greatpeople that I'm meeting so far like youguys are awesome like it's been such afun fun ride for me and I'm so glad thatI've gotten back into it so yeah okayyes enough of that let's get Intel okayso the first thing I'm going to show youis some I guess I shouldn't show youstuff like from different stores becauseI hate when I see people like oh this isfrom here this is from you notice itgets me confused so I'm just going to dostore by store um which there's only twostores okay so basically I have littlelemon forever 21 and to make up stuff sobasically um I went to lululemon for thefirst time I bought some stuff overChristmas and I showed you guys thetights that I bought and I have to sayI'm probably going to do another videoon that but let's just say I needed toget another one because i think i boughtthe wrong once so luckily these onesactually were gifted to me well I taughtsome yoga classes for Lululemon and theylet me so graciously go into their storeand pick out sothing that I wanted and I picked upthese I wanted to get them in the likepurple eat plum color that they had butthey didn't have my size they only hadlarger sizes so i got the black whichI'm still really happy about they arecalled the align pant so I mean they'retight like let's be real they're typesbut what makes them different is theyare high rise tight so you can seethey're pretty high there and they alsohave this like well it's not mesh butlike it's just like an indent band andso this is the high band and then theband on the back goes until I can be soit actually makes your booty you lookpretty plump and for a girl who has apretty big booty on her own like justmakes mine look a little more you knowraised up I guess and I guess the girlwas telling me for people who like arelacking in the booty area it helps tomake things look a little more full soand then these don't go all the way downbut they I guess they're like threequarter length they're like past theknee mid calf or whatever and the mostimportant part about these pants is likethey're so so soft they're called likethe naked pants I think because they'resupposed to feel like you're naked and Ido a lot of hot yoga and teach hot yogaso these are amazing when I tried themon I was like oh my god i bought thewrong pants because he's her exactlywhat i wanted and i didn't buy theseoriginally for myself so i love them andif you're looking for new lulu pantsplease do yourself a favor these aregreat for I would just wear these forgoing around doing errands like they'rethat soft and comfortable yes I got thatthen also I picked up while I was therethis sports bra and I have to say I amin love with the sports bra on you guysare probably like holy black everythingthere's a lot of block of this home I'mgoing to be real um it's just a blacksports bra and you can see some lovelystaining there that was that wasn'tum I swear to god you try and lululemonblacks worth once they all have likedeodorant stains and stuff on them it'sso annoying because everyone alwaystries them on when they're gross anywaysbut it looks like this in that friendand then the back it has like thecrisscrossing and the little thing thething I really love about it is whenit's on it's like a really deep neck andit's really flattering and um it hugs inthe body but it's not super like um likeThor is for it oh my god but you justdon't feel like you're being crushed byyour sports bra and I hate thatespecially for someone who's not verywell endowed I don't need all of thatsupport so I'm always looking for likesoft breathable flexible materials andsports bras so that one I am obsessedwith ok and then since we're in thissport I just realized I had I had two ofthe exact same thing this is likeChristy of a problem first of all withblack and second of all problem with nowblack sports gear because it's so funnybecause I was in class the other game islike feeling like a baller in my newLulu on Lulu and I go to class and likeliterally five girls in the same clusterburning the exact same thing that waslike damn you or notno longer said I was still feelingfalling okay because they just fitreally good like I had to say if you getthe right ones for your body type theydo fit like really good okay and thenthe other thing i got these are fromforever 21 by the way this is likecollective things i've picked up alongthe way then go like one day and by allthis not that it's like a huge extremehole but yeah it's collected okay andthese are black tight yet three-quarterlength but what is unique about theseones is that it has that crisscrossingthe leg it's so cute I really reallyliked it and I tried them on in thestore they have like a similar littleflower detail they don't make the bootylook as nice let's be real and theyaren't as breathable and they aren't asoft and you know but these were I think1999 and if you go to Lulu I think thepants I got were like 105 originallyplus text so yeah I mean you get whatyou pay for i guess um and then theother thing i got which i was going togo damn I should've waited until I firstopened this but I opened like I jumpedopen the bag because I wouldn't have aborn I name is forever 21 stuff and Idumped it open and then this camefalling out was like what hi hi white hihe didn't take the tag off so I need togo back now and get this taken off theylook like I stole it which I did it bythe way have my receipt but this is whatI want and this is a sports bra whichnow I was like kind of like is this asports bar it is this Impala like whatis this but we'll see i'm not reallysure how I'm gonna rock this just yetbut it just fit like so nice like soflattering it's super open in the frontlike I feel like I'm not doing thisjustice at all and then you can see likethe mesh on the front and it's super lowbut again it like it has like huffinghere so it like hugs you in so nothingnothing's going nowhere especially ifyou are like a tiny be / a cup you arefine anyways and so then the back is acrisscross and the front and the backalso had like this is the worst tryingto show this holy um it has thesepieces that fall down around the frameof like the front and then all right ohmy god the back so you can see these hesays yeah like I'm definitely gonna haveto do a video i show you how some ofstuff looks because it's like impossibleto show you but super cute looks supercute on it's a little scandalous so I'mnot sure I originally got it for liketeaching and wearing to hot yoga becauseyou're dying of heat when you're inthere but now I'm like I figured thatworst case i can always wear i was likea bralette or even like a swimsuitbecause it has that like wickingmaterial like i know we gonna make useof this it's super cute okay last threeclothing items number one this shirtthat I got which is like a brandylook-alike crop top shirt like it's notfully cropped but it um it's almost alsocropped up and it green I didn't haveanything this color and has like thetrim and so it's like green and yellowkind of super cute so I'm just happywith that and then this guy I not I kindof bought this because they had a saleup forever 21 or you could like buy onething and get the other thing half offfrom the sale section and I couldn'tfind anything you know when you go thereand you're

guys it's been a while since I've done ahalt I think it's been about a month andI've just been super busy so I figured Iwould combine the past two weeks thatI've done I'm of shopping and show youguys exactly what I've gotten my guessfor the full / winter season so I guesswe'll start with this forever 21necklace that I love it's like thisgreenish teal color and I love bigstatement necklaces and I love the onesthat they have at j.crew I just don'treally want to spend ninety dollars on anecklace so I found an alternative whichwas something like this and this wastwelve dollars and eighty cents and I'veworn it quite a few times i left thefact that it comes down like this kindof like chandelier um style i guess andi love the color of it and then I gotthis one then this one was think sevendollars you know when I first saw it Iwas like oh it's a little tacky but Ithink of you wear it with the rightthing it'll be really cute so these arethe two things that I got from forever21 I also went to macy's and i love themacy's at the beverly center if you goduring their one-day sales you cantotally totally find a bunch of reallycute stuff for very cheap one of myfavorite brands is free people and halfmy closet is free people in every time Igo to their one-day sale at Macy's inBeverly Center I seriously find the bestthings I got this really cute tunicstyle top I'm sure it could be addressedin the summer it's free people and i gotit for i think it was around $14 and theoriginal price was 58 so i thought thatwas the steel and when it gets cold Icamera it with leggings and some bootsand a cute little jacket and then I gotthis one some of these don't have tagsbecause I've already warned them and Igot this free people top i love the factthat it kinda has a little ruffle in theback and I like the mesh detailing ofthis makes it see-through so it showsjust a little bit of skin and I got thisfor sixteen dollars and I think itoriginally was like saidd or something like that nein I got thisreally cute dress I love all theirdresses so this is the dress it looks alittle short but it's not that bad iguess this is the back and this dress igot for $28 from 120 or something and ilove it i love the ombre the fact thatit changes colors and i'll definitelyworried about actually already worn itworked with boots and it looked reallycute and i needed jeans really bad iwear jeans all the time so I found thesereally cute citizens of humanity jeansyour straight leg and I got these for$65 from 200 bucks which I guess wouldsay is a really good deal I love theseuses the only thing is that for somereason all of the citizens of humanityjeans that i purchased seem to get baggyafter a while and that's the onlyproblem i would say i have with thisJean I've also had a different one bycitizens of humanity and it just getssaggy and loose under the legs in thebutt area and after a while I don't feelvery cute way them but once you washthem and take him out of the dryer andstaff they seem to kind of shrink upback to the original I guess sighs thenI got these cute purple shorts by joejoe's jeans um they were on sale for 25bucks from 128 and i thought that eventhough it might start to get cold ithink they'll be really cute in thesummer and i live in santa barbara soit's usually always decent enough towear shorts except when it rains so ithought that was a really good deal andi got these really cute white white Joegenes and their crop a very simplepocket and ya got these for 35 bucks andobviously they're on sale becausethey're white because white is I guess asummer thing butwear them anyways regardless of theirwhite or black and I got this other freepeople top let me figure it out okay sothis is the front and it's as the backit kind of has this really cute not thisI got for 13 bucks or something likethat and I just think it's so cute withlike a little lace bandeau because it'skind of low on the side it will show thelease and I think it's cute that it'skind of loose so I'll wear it with askinny jean or a short or something alittle bit more fitted I think that'sall for Macy's so yeah I got all thatstuff and it was I got under 150 bucksso I was very excited for that Marshallsis the second so I went to I went to theone here in Santa Barbara like I saidit's from the past two weeks combined soI like Marshalls because they have a lotof cute stuff I got these AG jeansthey're skinny yeah the like they'reskinny skinny jean and this is my firstpair of AG jeans I usually wear sevenjeans or Frankie be you know Frankie behigh school jeans I love those but i gotthese AG jeans for thirty nine ninetynine forty bucks and they're actuallyprobably my top three favorite Jean justbecause the way they fit they don'tloosen up there really flattering in thebutt area and the legs and I love themwith boots because I think skinny jeansare perfect with boobs & anything likethat and they'll be really cute with abig oversized sweater mean I said freepeople I got this really cute likemilitary jacket from free people atmarshalls it was $25 and it's so cuteit's warm thick it has this black liningin the inside but it's actually prettywarm and I think it'll be cute for dressas I wore it with jeans and bootsbecause it was cold recently one day itwas probably cold because it's alwayswarm here so yeah so that's when I gotfrom marshalls and Macy's um I think Iwould say my favorite favorite thingthat I purchased in the past two weekshas to be these products on glasses iusually don't spend that much money onsunglasses just because i usually breaktheor we use them or somebody steps on themwhen i leave them in my car so I gotthese amazing Protestant glasses thestyle is called baroque and they'rereally cute an aside has this reallypretty swirl and they're my favoritefavorite favorite favorite sunglasses Igot kind of like this pinky I guess toneI guess that's what it that was adescription like this paint chalon thelens is kind of pink and um they come ina black they come in like I guess like acheetah print I don't know I guess I wasa cheetah print but um they also come ina blue and a few other colors I thinkthese are the four colors actually theycome in and i already have blacksunglasses and i already have with thischeetah print I think it's called HavanaI don't know I might be making up butand those are the two that I alreadyhave color wise so I was like oh I needto get something different so I gotthese and you can find these atNordstrom's unify them on sax online andthey were 290 and like I said that's thelaw I don't usually spend that much onone thing cuz that's like almost my oneof my monthly car payment so I was justlike you know what I need to get thembecause I've wanted them for a long timeand if you google prada broke spelledbeet AR o qu e you'll get a ton ofdifferent links if you're interested ingetting something like that and i thinkthey have a few other really cool styleswith the swirls and you'll definitelylove them I've had him for a few daysand I just like we want to wear themeven when I go inside places so yeah sothat was my favorite purchase within thepast two weeks I still have a few otherthings I have to show you guys let megrab them this actually isn't the pasttwo weeks this is probably like a montha half ago but these tory burch flatssorry it keeps getting dark these toryburch flats i would say are the bestflats i have ever ever ever purchasedand tried on and worn and i love themthey come in this color in a nude and igot the black first because i don't haveblock but i love the fact that it hasthe stretchy thing right hereand it makes it that much morecomfortable and these were 225 225 atnordstroms in it's a really goodinvestment I mean 225 really go i canbuy a ton of other stuff with that but ithink this is one of the bestinvestments that I have made shoe wisejust because you can just fold themstick them in your purse you know throwthem on in I think they're sosophisticated and easy that you canthrow them on with what I'm learningright now or you can wear them with adress or skinny jeans or tights I don'tknow I love them and I would definitelyrecommend them for anyone that's lookingfor the perfect flat okay so you know Iused to shop at Abercrombie all the timewhen I was in high school or elementaryschool and literally my closet wasAbercrombie because it was like thecoolest place to go to and I haven'tbeen there in a long long time justbecause it's not really my style I guessanymore but I found a few things onlinethat I thought I could potentially wheremake look cute for example this littlefrilly skirt it's a little young but Iam young um I thought it would be cutewith a white tank top and a cute jeanjacket and flats or sandals and it wasonly eleven dollars or something reallyan expensive like that so I figured Icouldn't go wrong and it fits it's onyour hips are you like a higher wastedit would be adorable so I got that Ihaven't worn it yet and then I got thisreally cute quartz a corset top and youcan tie this make it into a bow and Ithink it would be really cute with thegene oh my bows a little crappy but youget the idea and this was like twelveninety something so those are the twothings that i got from abercrombie theone thing that i haven't stopped gettingfrom a burr homie are their tank tops Idon't buy them full price because 25bucks or however much they cost for atank top to me is ridiculous so I got Ithink too they're lost somewhereprobably in my laundry I gotand then I got a white a white for sureand they were like seven bucks orsomething and I just like the way thatthey fit not the racerback ones just thenormal ones because I can wear my brawith it without having to worry aboutshowing my bra so yeah those are theother two things that i got fromabercrombie and then we're gonna move onto some awesome shoes by jeffreycampbell i always loved their boxes tojeffrey campbell design on their boxexhaustion I believe these actually Idon't need anything but I love to shopand I'm a girl so you know how it is soI got these really cute wedges byjeffrey campbell they are adorable ihave yet to wear them they're one of mymost recent purchases and they have aplatform so that really helps to walk inthem so they're not really that high toput like three inches high if you wereto talk without the platform and i gotthese on sale for 87 or somethingdollars online and i love them and theyhave them in a different color but ithink they're sold out now because theywere just so inexpensive well I mean 80bucks is kind of a long but for JeffreyCampbell you can't go wrong and I thinkthese will be adorable adorable with anoversized sweater like this and a scarfand just a cute little crossbody bag sothat is my recent jeffrey campbellpurchase i've heard a lot of good thingsabout his wedges they're not toohorrible to walk in because i buy a lotof heels and wedges and stuff and Ihonestly wear them for like two hoursand I'm done like the ChristianLouboutins that i purchased a few monthsago like half a year ago or whatever ilove them but i can only wear them forlike hour and a half men my feet aredone and you're going to spend fivehundred dollars on a pair of shoes youwant to make sure you're actually youknow where them so i try to wear them asoften as i can but it's kind ofdifficult to think about spending thatmuch money on a shoe that you're reallynot going to worry about much so that'swhy the tory burch flats I think that'sdefinitely a great investment so whereis it hereís so I've heard a lot of goodthings about lululemon i actually haveneverpurchase anything from there untilrecently one of my best friends has likeLululemon workout pants like that's allshe wears I think I gotta give these agoI know the price is a little steep it'slike $72 for these they're just likesome cubot crops and I actually have tosay that they are the best material whenit comes to yoga / workout pants andshorts and tops and whatnot I didn'twant to spend the 72 dollars on thembecause that's a lot of money for a pairof workout pants but I did it and I'veworn them two or three times so far andi have to say they are amazing and i'mgonna go back and get the full lengtheventually so yeah these are the croppants and they're really cute they havethis pocket that um i guess is for yourcredit card and your keys and it's deepin there so it doesn't get lost but ihaven't put anything in there yet so sothat is my lululemon purchased and lastbut not least i got these page thesepaige jeans that have um so you can'treally I don't know you can see theshininess but it kind of has this waxymaterial and I've wanted leather pantsfor a really long time but I can't findany without having them be 500 bucksyeah you can see the shininess so it'slike a it's like a wax coated denim andI love them I haven't worn them yet andhang out these that makes his own aswell these were on sale you're like 160something and I have never owned a pairof paige jeans so the AG jeans and thesepaige jeans are my first time owningthis brand when it comes to jeans sowe'll see how it goes and excited towear these and then i said last but notleast but there's one more thing ididn't purchase it one of my bestfriend's got them for me because she'sjust awesome i have worn through all myclothes there I've worn um converse youknow Chuck's Chuck Taylors for a longtime but I've never had high tops and Iwanted to tell me I didn't want to getthem so my best friend let me see if youcan see themshe got these for me just the white yeahthere we go just the white and I lovethem so far it's like a got like I was alittle kid playing on the jungle jumpdoing that but yeah I've worn them withmy Lululemon's when I went to theuniversal studios horror night southerneight and i love them i usually don'twear tennis shoes and I think these weperfect to throw them on with skirts anddresses even though I know a lot ofpeople don't like tennis shoes withdresses and skirts and cute jeans etcbut I think they'll be Q and I like themso I can't wait to wear them why I'mwearing them right now but you know whatI mean

looking goodthank you well compliments to each otherso listenduke i i reached out to you on you knowon linkedin you know that thatphenomenal moment of seeinguh a clip of yours which we'll get intoin a little bityou graciously replied i immediately didsome homework on youum through you know the medium of uhyou know typing you into search enginesand so i've got a real strong sense ofwho you arebut for those that don't know who dukestump isum and first first of all we we can'tnegate the fact that you have one of thegreatest names that's everbeen given you know and with a name likejuke stump you had to do something goodrightso well i will say thatthe name growing up is hard because youget there's a lot of ribbing going imean especially with the last namestump and so if you could just fightthrough thethe judgment and the bullying early onthen it's okay on the other end but thatin my youth it wasn't so great and whatwas the thinkingprocess behind that mom well actuallythe the my real name is first name isscottright but i was in grade schoolum and there was five scots in the classand the teacher said pick a nickname andi went home that dayand i'm not sure everyone's gonna knowthis program but it was calledgilligan's island it was just thetv series and it was a surfer guy thatwashed the shore on this deserted islandand his name was duke and i told my mommy name is duke and she's like okay mymom devlinsure i wanted to change my last name toobut they were like we're not having thatyou gottayou get one that's it that's the way itis sonso anyway yeah i've had it since theearly 70s so it's beenfeeling when i hear scott i know i'm introubleit's either like you know no oneaddresses me as scot unless it'ssomething formalso if i know if i send you an email withscott in it you know you'll payattention to that yeahthis is something that i need to beattending to solisten i'd just like to get a sense ofumfor people that don't know you uh andwhen i say who is dukeum what are you known for what is whatis the stuff thatwhen people do have a line of sight onyou they'll be alert to that history soa little bit of justum that that what you're known in theworld for it'd be great to hear ityeah i mean i i i think in onehand i'm actually known for being uhunreasonable and irrationallike my career choices i think a lot ofpeople are like scratch their heads likewho does thatand um you know professionally i'veworkedat really amazing places and emotionallychargedbeautiful cultures like nike now thatwas actually where i reallylearned i learned so much there actuallyand i was i spent 15 plus yearsa third of it in product i was in salesat one point inhawaii which you know obviously has beena bad bad gig butum i think it was just an amazing timeand andit's very few people leave nike butafter 15 plus years i felt i wasreally comfortable and wasn't growing soi left but it wasclear to me what i was curious about andi think curiosity is a common threadthroughout my lifei wanted to be a part of something supermeaningful and pioneering and so i wentto this place called seventh generationwhichum was a leader in corporateresponsibilities50 people 50 million dollars makingeco-conscious product andyou know there i did learn the role ofsoul in business and so whatappeared to be incredibly irrational tomy friendsi mean it was in fact an executive atnike had said i just committed careersuicide when i said i was leavingand i was like i'm really reallyconfident in this decisionit wasn't just like heat of the momentshift like i really thought it throughum but i in that nike it's interestingthere was a period there wheremy first job was called an econ it's oneof the most revered roles and it's nikespelled backwardsand the whole concept is you have toknow brand forwards and backwards andyou put into a marketplaceand you're the eyes and the ears and thevoice of the brand and i was in southerncalifornia so it was amazing you knowthat's my first job i'm youngbut one of the key things in that wasaboutsensing and signals like what are yousensing what are the signals that wouldsuggest what's emergingand so when you do a monthly report itwasn't like hey this is what's sellingit was likewhat are you sensing and i feel likethat's a practice that i've carried outthroughout my life andso going from nike to seventh generationwas easy because i was sensing man therewas this thing around corporateresponsibility andpioneering a new way of doing businessas a force of good that was interestingand when i went i then you know yearslater i went to lululemonto head up brand and primarily i'd beenin the world the roles of cmoor lululemon it was evp of brandoncommunitybut for me that was also an interestingadventure because one in the fall of2014 when i got there it was listed as abrand thatby wall street that wouldn't exist in2015. so it wasn't like a better rosesit had gone through some kind ofmercurial times but i was fascinatedwith therole of this thing called mindfulnessand what it means in our world and thatwas my curiosity at the timeand uh that was fun you know i spentthree and a halfyears there trying to in partnershipwith some amazing people within thatcompany tocreate the renaissance of this oncerevered brand and to bring it back andthat wasuh incredible and then most recently upuntil this past march i was at limewhich is a micro mobility and it wasn'tbecause i was fascinated with scootersin factwhen i first saw it in santa monica iwas like this is an absolute show like who what kind of businessis this because they were justeverywherebut when i got into the role thattransportationplays in human lives i was fascinatedaround transit deserts and transitequityand i was like wow like transportationi've never thought of itas this vehicle for enhancing human lifebut it'sincredibly powerful when it can be usedcorrectly so that's a long answer sayi've been in some really fascinatingplacesum i've learned a lotfrom things and a lot of things thathaven't gone well iactually don't i give all thosetough moments a big hug because i thinkthat's where a lot of my key learning isum and i'm have two grown amazing youngwomen as childrenwho are in uh one's out of universityone's in universityand my wife you know we've been together25 plus years she'si don't know if there's enoughsuperlatives i can share about who sheis and what she is other thanshe's a yogi and buddhist which is anamazing to have as a partner because shegrounds me when i you knowstart to lose it a little bitthat's um a great introduction so thankyou very much for thatum and when i i think one of theinterests i've got thethe podcast is called leadership rightssoit's elements of when leaders arere reflecting umwhat are the what can be or people thatwould like to be in a leadership rolewhat do they maybe need tothink about so for me my experience ofyouvicariously from a distance and theobservation of that isthat you know if you're heading up arole let's just take let's just takelike nike for examplethere's the span of control you've gotthere's the resources you've got and theexpectationsthat come with the role and then there'sthei guess what it is that you stand forandthe the following you as a personand i'm just wondering in your growthhas that been what maybe that thatthat understanding of maybe at first wasit fulfilling the roletrying to get the task done but actuallyi've learned or what i'm hearing thereis thatthe experience of me and what that meanswhat i'm offering to peopleand have you ever had to balance that orif you had moments where that's becomemoreimportant to you or realizing thatyeah so a couple things one isi don't think financials are a predictorof success i think i do reallyfundamentally they're a function ofdoing these other things well andso a lot of those other things iscreating an environment and culturewhere there'sempathy um where there's curiosityum where there's courage um wherethere's trustand so for me i've been fortunate i'vehad great mentors like i had one mentorwho saidyou any role you get in leadership youshould make yourselfdisplaceable you know and at first i waslike why would i do that i want toyou know i'm trying to get you knowmaybe to this position and she'sshe was like no just act asact as if you your job is to be makeyourself displaced but because then thebehavior becomeshow do i actually nurture and cultivatethose aroundaround the team in this in my role andmy functionto grow and whether you're displaceableor not is kind ofis not really the point the point isthat there's a behavior shift so it'sless aboutterritorial and you know my friend hasthis amazingbelief that as you grow up in the in anycompany and up the ladder that youbecome more and more of a sociopathand you forget what it's like to behuman in the world of businessand for me ii it's no different than parenting alittle bit i want to be able to mentorbut i also want to be mentored so i lovecreating environments wherei'm constantly growing from those aroundme on on my team and i've been fortunatemore often than notthat's the case and so and i've neverreally sought a job i've never said whattitle do i want i've really morei generally am like hey this seems likea really interesting place to beyou know and then i'm generally land ina brand role or whatever butand i think the last thing for me is umi i like environments where people canbe their effortless selveswhere they can just show up and not be acog in the wheel but be recognized i'man introvert by nature and being anintrovert especially in a c-suiteit's hard as hell because you sit thereand you justtake it all in and you know krishnamurtiis a famous philosopher here in ojai andhe would always say beware the man whoknowsand i would write that in my notebook inmeetings all the time because i was likea reminder likestay curious stay curious they'recurious and umand so i'd like to think that i have anand create an environment where peoplefeel there'spsychological safety that they'retrusted and they're empoweredand they're pushed in a good healthy wayumyeah but it's i just think at the end ofthe day i'm really obsessed with what itmeans to be human in business and i feellike that's just somehowlike exited uh the world right nowso one of the things that i know you'reworking on i think you just launchedis bonfire with seoul yeahdot com um which i know one of myuh colleagues has already signed up forand i'll make all sure all the links areinthe podcast notes um i'd love to hearabout that becausethat's what triggered me to call you isaw on mylinkedin feed that video which againi'llmake sure there's a link to uh and itgrabbed me i mean the production qualitywas exceptional which i'd expectnow that i know what you're about but itthe nature of itcaught me it wasn't the productionquality but it was the nature of itit reached into me and made me go oh mygoodness so i'dit's obviously a passion and i'd love tojusthear what it is to you and if iif i was going to pay attention to itwhy why wouldn'twhat i get out of it yeahwhat's important is a little bit of theback story sogrowing up early in my youth in themidwest my parents were high schoolteachers um in the late 60s and early70s andum so i think there was this teachingwaslike within my my dna if you willand then during the financial crisis ihad created my own company but itaught at a couple graduate schoolsand hands down those were the mostrewarding experience you knowteaching for me was like it was a loveaffair i was mentoring and i was beingmentored but i wasalso infusing into the that not aplaybook but a philosophy around what ibelieved around businessand it was an outlier approach for sureit wrinkled some feathersyou know i i would say i thinkcompetition is an archaic thoughtyou know and yet in business schoolyears first thing you're taught is heylet's go into thecompetition slide and so in januaryuh my wife and i always do this exerciseof imagine a day and it's like your twofeet hit the ground and you're excitedabout today so what does the day looklike andi it was visceral for me i was like iwant to teach againi just and a lot of it stemmed from thefact thati'm as i'm in the bowels of businessi'm just watching what's happening andthen i read thisstudy that she said 85 percent of peopleare not engaged at work81 of people would find a new job if onecame upand less than a third of people feltthere was a great culture andi was like man my foeis business schools that teach thisarchaic way of thinking and my fault isthe acceptancethat of the status quo like we spent somuch time of our lives in the workingworld and so i thinkthe mere thought that someone would notfeel engaged at workwas unsettling for me and soi left lyme in march and then i was likeyou know what like i have thisthis itch to share this philosophy tothe world likewhat better time to do than than now andi initially thought i wouldwant to teach at a graduate school butthe more i looked at the curriculumand the the framework in which i had tooperate i was likei want to break the rules that bind idon't want to be a part of thisand so i've served up this course calledbonfires with seouland it's uh 12 principlesthat um but they're built around storyand real lifeexperiences and soi want to be able to share with theworld the news i don't think the worldneeds another business school businessschool course i needed i think it needsa new school of thoughtand my vision and hope is that thisphilosophy isn't the end-all be-all butthat itit sparks a revolution for people thatare questioningbusiness like once againi want introverts to thrive in businessand being an introvert in business ispretty damn hard you know it's likewhoever can talk the loudest or make themost statements and i wantinquiry to thrive and you know uh whatdoes you choose to saywasn't the answers we had right it wasthe questions we had wrong i want peopletolive in a sense of inquiry all the timeand be in observance andin this course what's interesting is mymentors are not businessmy mentors are nature i'm i've been apart of something called biomimicrywhich is like ask naturewhich is an amazing thing founded byjanine beniusin the 90s i've been i was on the boardfor actually eight yearsmy mentors are horsemanship think horsewhispermy mentors are buckminster fuller yogakrishna morty here in ojai and so i liketo bring inpoetry um i like to bring in a differentinflux of thinkingbecause and it's not my nature to be anantagonist so i want to be an inspiredprotagonistaround just challenging convention inthe status quo in a way that can open upa different conversation and hopefullydifferent behaviorso um is this aimedat well let me rephrase that question sowho would you liketo pay attention to thisyeah it's great ques it's a greatquestion i don't it's interesting iit's not a demographic in fact eveneverywhere i've gone i'mi think demographics are an interestingpiece but they're a subseti think the main thing more for meeverywhere gone is what's the mindsetthat uh we want to connect with andi feel like we've termed it theoptimistic rebel and it's the nextgeneration of business leaders who arelike man i know there's a better wayi can sense it or see it or whatever buti refuse to acceptthe status quo i'm just not sure and sothat mindset it's really for bonfiresoul is an introduction into this otherpathso anybody thatin my space the leadership space thatwould be potential talent of peoplewanting to move into managementleadership roles all the way through toa c-suite group of people very muchcould be the audience for thisuh absolutely i mean um i i will sayi haven't i think deep down i'm not sureit'll be a lot of c-suite people becausewhat i've seen in c-suite isthere's not really a beginner's mindaround much and it's like you get tothis place and thenall curiosity inquiry kind of evaporatesand so it'sit's probably for the next generation ofbusiness leaderum and you know i've seen registrationalready some c-suite people so i'm notknocking that i love what i just wishthere was more curiosity around itumyeah so anyways it's um and it's alsothe other thing the key thing isi've been a i've used this philosophy inpublic companiesprivate companies small companies bigcompaniesi'm on the board of several non-profitsandit's the same philosophy and sowhat i share is that it has no bias likeit doesn't you don't have to be a bigcompany a small company or public or aprivate or a proprofit or non-profit it is i believeand i've borne witness to it over thelast 30 plus years that it'sit's applicable and accessible really toanybody that wants theis open to a new way of thinking andwhat i expect to findi need to start asking better questionsnot close questions buti suppose the question is you know whatdo i find within the course what do iwhat is the learning that i can expectto receive that might reinforce the goodmight calibrate where i'm close butcould be better or what what mightfundamentally bring me challengebut the the heartbeat of bonfire withsoul is really aboutuh culture brand and leadership andmy hope and my intentionis to invite a different way or adifferent lens of how we look at a lotof differentthings so for example you know ithe first principle is product is amirror into your soul andmy what i share is that if you don'thave a great productthe rest of the 11 principles aresomewhat mutedum that said i think it's less aboutalways a physical productyou know or a digital product and aproduct is every touch pointso bonfire was sold and we've beenmaniacal aboutevery touch point so for example wecreated a manifesto bookand then we're like all right wellwhat's the packaging oh it's going to goin the post and we're like well that'snotreally is that really what we want to doand then the teamat the do lectures who i've partneredwith you know they're like hey we'regoing to put it in this box withkindling and it's going to be a stickerlike here's your fire starter kit and somy point is that like on product forexample like you it's not about creatinga product team it's about creating aproduct culture and it's recognizingthatevery single touch point mattersand you're defined by everything you dowell and everything you do not so welland unfortunately the latterhas sometimes more impact on people thanthe formerum you know and then i look at ichallenge thewhole idea of competition you know atnike we didn't we didn't talk aboutcompetition becausewe recognized that we weren't in thebusiness of making sneakers and teas wewere in the business of bottlinginspirationand that that was a completely differentjet stream thanhow everyone else was playing and so wejust we were like you know what theworld needs now that we're most uniquelyqualified to deliver is inspirationand innovation so let's do thatad nauseam but just evolve it and so asan exampleif you think about nike umyou know obviously it's createdinspiration on thethe pitcher and the sports arenas in thefields but then it's done it withthe girl effect which was an incrediblyeffectivebody of work from nike and it's become aun resolution about the role ofeducationfor for women it did a lot of work onif you let me play back in the late 90sabout letting young girls the role assports plays in the lives of youngwomen as they grow up it was about colinkaepernickyou know taking a stance and that waslevel of inspiration but that simpleidea ohyou know i think i just to me whenyou're obsessed with competition itcreates a culture of fearbecause you're looking at what othersare doing constantly and there becomesangst andanxiety where when you play with anunbridled passion aroundthis like open territory mosaic for youthen it's then it's fun i meanwhen i got to lululemon it was a toughtime and i remember people like oh lookat what these other brands are doing i'mliketime out time out just put that to thesideand we said what do what'swhat business uh do we need to be in andthrough the help of some amazing peoplewe got to this place of hey the worlddoesn'tneed to do yoga it needs to be yogaso how can we show that yoga shows up inyou knowyoga is more than just on the map that'sasana is just oneof the eight limbs of yoga there's sevenother amazing limbs that actuallyreinforce what it means to be human inthis in this world andshows up every day compassion empathywhateverso let's let's begin to adventure downthat path and then thatwas just like a rocket ship it was likewe just took offand so in terms of the learning i'msharing what i believe are thefundamentalthings that are not about financialfinancials but thethe thinking and the attitude and thebehavior that will deliver those butalsomore importantly deliver a real vibrantculturein the community both inside and outsideof your your brand or your companyso i'm i'm really feeling a sense ofhumanity in play here anda real kind of umyou know one of the things i often seein businesses is this phrase corporatesocial responsibilityand i've often said can we just lose theword corporateyou know and just call it socialresponsibilityand there's there's something here whichis you there's something here which ismaybe bigger than youin the sense of where potentiallysomething like this could go buti imagine that there'sum this is about people'ssense of relationship with themselvesthis is about the permissions they givethemselves andwhere they want to put their energy andtheir focus anddealing with their fear i guess of do ihave the right as a human being well idobut am i given a space to be humanand and it's a it's i can sense thatthere's athere's a lot of challenge in this so isthis program veryin terms of the experience of it is itmodular-led is itfrom um other conversations i imaginelistening to a video or watching amodulewould trigger so much potentialneed for greater conversation how doesthatwhere does that go and and how does theprogram or if it does deal with thatbecause there's a trigger point and thenthere's my need to talk about ityeah i mean humanness is at the heart ofhow i holdof so many things i mean i've alwaysquestioned and it's aquestion i'll never be able to fullyanswer but it's like what does it meanto be humanand when we were developing bonfire withsoul initially it was like hey we'regoing to do these zoom calls butgoing back to product is a mirror toyour soul i was worried about a couplethings i was worried about technicalglitchesbut i also wanted to romance thestorytelling throughmusic and b-roll footage and i wantedpeople to feellike what these things haven't come tolifethe other piece was i wanted tocomplement each principlewith another real life example frompeople i've knownthat can share their story and you cansee it and it'swe've added these podcasts once againwith uh musicand b-roll and so for example in thisthe principal wrong live empathyuh khalila is this amazing evp of hrtrue colors which who's pioneering a newway of looking at hrall built around empathy and so there's12 hours ofcontent recorded buti also want to have that interaction andsoum the course runs over three weeks itopensup with a live uh global zoom callwhere i just kind of say hey here's whatto expect and quick introi might have my wife do some breathingexercise at the start just to get usgroundedum and then in one week you drop arecordingof the principal you get the podcast butthen we also have aweekly q a zoom and i'vewe offer it up three times or two timesso that it's time zone appropriate[Music]and then there's a slack channel andit's been funny like the slack channelright nowis already on fire because it's acommunity of people i think that aresuper likei ca i give anybody credit right nowwho's registered for this course becausethey probably don't know me they're notreally sure exactly what imean they have a sense of what i'm goingto offer but they're not exactly sure sothey're insanely curiousum you know we've also made it likemoney back guarantee if you don't likeit like i don't want anyone to feel likethis waswasting my time so and ii don't believe that's going to be truebut if it is like that's that's finethati really just want people to walk awaylike damn that exceeded my expectationsum and so i'm actually going to bepretty active on slackum you know i imagine there's going tobe a lot of questions as well and thenwe close witha reflections global zoom where we justyou know i love to close withreflections in meetings and it's justlike okaywhere are we at what do we see what isthis where what what does this mean andkind of how to what what's next if youwillum and i will say the other thing iswe're ahead of our projections andregistrations which is super encouragingit um it ends tomorrowi think at midnight um but i think whati'm mostimpressed with is it's global i meanthere's it'sit's asia it's the pacific region it'sthe ukit's the you know germany franceswitzerlandus canada theit's i love the globalnature of it all and even thethere's no um set profile of people thathave registered it's people from allwalks of life doing all sorts ofdifferent thingsand do you expect to roll this as a as acontinual program if the need is therewe do we do i think this you knowit's been a pretty good investment oftimebut also finance you know like iinvested in recordings i invested in thepodcastum and so i think for us it was likehey we've we have all these things nowpackaged together why wouldn't we justcontinue tointroduce this so that you know as manypeople as possiblecan experience it we've also by the wayin this first onewe've done two price points we've donethe suggested price pointand then we've also recognized that it'sa really tough time in the world rightnowand um so we offered another price pointand we let people decidewhich one a lower price point they candecide which one they want toselect okay um but yeah i wouldone of the principles is the beauty ofnot knowing we created this this becausewe felt it was right for this momentand where it goes in the future i reallydon't know and i'm not sure we're tryingtodynamically steer it anyway we'll know alot after this first coursewell um i'm going to shout out to a ladycalled deandra who iknow will listen to this because thenshe'll go gold blind i can't believe youjust said my namebut i have because i showed her the clipand she wentwow and she's she said i've literallyi'm signingup before the video finishedso that's indicative of the impact thati think it could uh haveso i'm gonna sort of shift us away fromthat just for a moment um but i was socaught by it that i wanted to give itgood air time umand i guess i can imagine peoplethat intellectually emotionally buy intowhat it is that a you represent but alsowhat it is that you're offering within aprogram such as thisand i wonder if you ever have peoplethat intellectually buy into thisthinkingbut have a fear they fear what theymight see as the lackof permission orlicense or space to be themselvesin organizations that arebewitched by their agenda of thefinancialsand you know that's the kind of that'sthe kind of talk that doesn't really flyhereand i wonder um how thatyou know i don't know if it's advice orthe conversation that you might havewith people that goduke i get it and i'd love to do so buthave you seen where i work or have youmet my bossand i just wonder how that sits andmaybethe conversation that you have aroundthat sometimes because i imagine it mustcome upwell i can i have deep sense of empathybecause that's been mylife truthfully so i've had thisphilosophy or thesethoughts around things i think moreoften than notthe most challenging part of where i'vebeen in the different adventures isinternally not externallyit's getting people to see feel andtrust like that there's this way andi mean you know like when i got toseventh generation you know i thinkpeople first were likewho is this dude like what the hell ishe talking about or even at lou lemon iremember when we were doingthis campaign called this is yoga whichwas to reallyshare with the world why this brainmattered in a different waymy own peers and maybe rightfully sowe're like i don't get it like whatwhat's the return what's the revenuegonna be and i wouldtell them like i don't know what therevenue is gonna beyou know and so i ishare that because it takes courage likei don't want to settleyou know because i'm i feel like you cando an amazing mostrevolution start from the bottom up andi feel like if enough people startvoicingtheir needs in a different way or theirwants and desiresbeyond just the acceptance of thingsum i think that's the only way we'll goabout creating change truthfullyand it's not easy and i'm just you knowthere's been days where i'vehave been at companies where i feel likei'm salmon you know i swam upstreami fought i spawned and then i just diedyou know and then it's like okaylike on to another adventure but[Music]i go back to i don't i don't thinkanyone wants to just existin work i think they want to feel aliveand i would feel like that's worthfighting foreven if it meant truthfully having toughconversations withbosses or whatever becausethe the pain of accepting the status quoto me is fargreater than any pain that could comefrom that conversationso what is the revolution what's thewhat's the end game i thinki shouldn't say i think my belief isthat the my belief is the revolution isthat we recognizein business the role of what it means tobe humanwhen we create a culture of empowermentand trust when we live in a culture ofempathy you know and yoga namastevladimir is the light of you when wetake the time to understand people i bowto the divine in youyeah like so for example when i doone-on-one meetingslike at lululemon they weren't aboutbusiness primarily they were like what'sgoing onwith you and what's important like whereare you and we would have just reallyrobust conversations and so therevolution isrecognizing financials are not thepredictor of success but if you can dotheseother things while create a culture ofempathy create a culture of couragecreative culture ofof trust challenge howwe look at the business currentmechanical road business modelslike then you have this amazing capacityto do incredible thingsit's no different think of if you're ina theater group or on a sports teami mean i love the i'm just a typicalamerican i'm terrible at uhpremier league football so my apologiesbut when ilisten to is it klopp the i know knowmore about football than you doi'm aware there's a ramble involved andthat's where i top outyeah i just leadersi think vulnerability like how often dowe bring vulnerabilityinto uh the workplace like in theworkplace you all suddenly have to showup with a sense ofarmor in this map and then oh works overand then i can like take it all off andi'm likescrew that i want people to show up astheir effortless selvesevery day i want people i want to invitea diversity of thought and race andgender and ethnicity so that there'sthis like amazingsoil rich soil of microbes that can justchallengeyou know uh things and and yetbusinesses become monoculture monocrop thinking um we have this belief youknowlike that there's this hierarchy ofyou know as you get older or up theladder you're the wise one and thereality is some of the best thinking issprinkled throughoutany company culture in the most amazingplaces and soi just wanted i would love for companyto be human againand that goes back to me like trust andempathy and couragei love it i think it i think it's verypowerful i thinksome things come along for the righttime at the at the right timeand this this definitely is one of thosethings that without having experiencedit which i'mi'm gonna try and do um it reallyresonatesum is there anything else that you'reinvolved in that issomething that you want to talk about oractually if i sort of sayi know this is sort of very real rightnow butum where are you headed wheredo you have a sense of you knowi may not have every stepping stonestarted but i think over the next xamount of years where i'm trying to getto isyeah perhaps i'm anoutlier in this thinking but i don'twork from likethis big purpose of set of goalsi work on what i'm curious aboutand then i just invite and start ituh stay tuned to opportunity from thereand sofor me right now i'm i'm really enjoyingthis bonfire with soulendeavor i have no idea where it will goor won't gotruthfully so that's um you know that'smy own invitation into the unknown umbut i love the unknown whichyou know in human culture we weloathe uncertainty and i'mi'm actually the opposite i'm i'm likeman this is like there's you know chrischristian morty the philosopher says uhto know is to be in prisonto not know us to be free and so i'mjust curious and what i'm curious rightnow is the role ofhumanists in business i'm also supercurious about educationum in how like i'm on the board of thisamazing k-12 school here in ojaiwhich is incredibly uniquemy daughters went there and i feel likethey get it in terms of howthe role of education is to nurture andcultivate the whole child and the wholestudent not justknowledge based there's this other levelof learning that needs to happenum and so we'll see you knowi haven't i haven't been eager to jumpback in the business worldbecause i feel likewhere i need to be right now is thisinspired protagonist trying toyou know spark a different level ofthought andi don't i don't know where it will gobut i embrace thati think if you do a book i think that'syou that's your titlethe inspired protagonistyeah yeah it's funny myi don't think anything gets solvedthrough anger or hate orloathing i think it just exasperates adivideand so my whole thing is if i it's ilearned a lot of this even at nike youknow it wasn't uhwhen nicki was born fitness was likeronnie was like geez and crow who wantsto run but if you can inspireyou know you don't say hey get your assout there and start runningyou inspire people to run that'sdifferentlike we used to have this thing at nikeis if you saw anyone running on the sideof the road regardless ofhow slow fast whatever body shape youalways just give them a thumbs upyou just like yeah okay yeah i get whatyou're trying to doyeah and so for me i don'ti have a foe which once again isbusiness schoolsand the acceptance of the status quo buti want the body of work to be inspiringand so as an inspired protagonist not anantagonist that's important to me welllisteni'm hugely alert to your timeuh and i'm i'm you knowunder the right circumstances i couldkeep going on to the point where you goguy i really do need to go nowso i'm going to be really alert to thatum and i'm just going to thank you foryour time um you know it's given a bitof an insight into youit'll introduce you to some people thatyou know may not bealert to your work and i'm definitelygoing to you knowmake sure it gets as far as i can kindof put put it out thereum and and you know with your permissioni'll reach out andmaybe there's a phase two on this withwhere where you're going andwhat's happened and um you know thatthat could be really interestingfor people as as well so um so on thatnote i'm going to say thank you so muchand just ask you just to hang on for aminute when i press stop on the recordbutton just to make sure nothing goeswrong butduke thank you so much for your

what's up guys my name is Brock you'rewatching the modest man today we'retalking about the five best underwearbrands for men okay so we wear underwearmore than any other article clothing andit also covers a very important part ofour bodies so I think it's crucial thatyou have underwear that you really loveand it's super comfortable I think thata lot of guys don't realize howcomfortable underwear can be you know Iused to be in that group I used to buywhatever baggy cotton boxers I couldfind on sale on a multi pack at a Parkinstore but once I discovered it the worldof super comfortable underwear you knowthere's no going back but first of allwhat makes a great pair of underwear Ithink it comes down to two main thingsnumber one it has to be really reallycomfortable it has to be soft no chafingit doesn't ride up and number two it'sgot to be durable you know especially ifI'm paying good money for a pair ofunderwear I don't want it to fall apartor stretch out or start to deteriorateafter a few wash cycles now I've triedmany many different underwear brands alot of the most popular brands somelesser-known manufacturers and I'venarrowed it down to my top five picksthese are five specific pairs ofunderwear from five different brandswith one honorable mention quick notethis is not a sponsored video but I willlink to all this underwear down in thedescription and if I have any promocodes I'll include those down there aswell ok number one the Lululemon noboxer boxers now I know what you'rethinking isn't a Lululemon that playsfor my girlfriend goes to get overpricedyoga pants yes it is but I think theyrealized somewhere along the way thatthere are a bunch of guys waiting fortheir girlfriends to finish up shoppingand maybe they would like to buysomething too so Lululemon actuallycreated one of the most comfortable anddurable pairs of underwear that I'veever worn and actually I have to give mydad credit for finding these I thought Ihad the underwear game figured out andone year he he got me a pair of thesefor Christmas and he said you know youhave to try these the most comfortableunderwear I've ever worn so I thought okI'll give him a shot and I got to say hewas right these are one of my favoritepairs they're made from lycra so it's avery dry very soft fabric but it's notlike micro Modell where it has a ton ofstretch has a little bit of four-waystretch but not a whole lot really goodat wicking moistur you could definitelyworeout we go for a hike in these my onlycomplaint about these is that you knowthey're not the best looking underwearin the world they're not ugly they'rejust compared to some of the other picson my list they're just not remarkableyou know but I don't know it's it's awell rounded pair of underwear so ifyou're looking for something that's justyou know durable good for pretty muchany occasion definitely recommendLululemon no box or boxers okay numbertwo we have the tinny silk cut boxerbriefsso if Lululemon is the laid-back girlnext door at Annie is that lady at workthat kind of looks like a supermodelthat you're pretty sure is out of yourleague but might have been flirting withyou the other day these are justluxurious okay they're they're knit inEurope they're made from micro Modellwhich is a softer and thinner than silkthey also have 6% elast stain woven inso plenty of four-way stretch andthey're just super super comfy well whatreally sets tani apart is how they lookthe only word I can really think of todescribe these is sexy and especiallythese printed ones they also have solidcolors but I think these prints arereally nice they also make a trunkversion of this which is a slightlyshorter but I prefer the box for briefbecause I think it doesn't ride up asmuch what surprised me about these isthey're so soft and they're so thin thatI kind of thought they wouldn't hold upwell but I've been wearing these for acouple of years pretty regularly andthey retain their shape but they haven'tstretched out they've even retain theircolor so you know they're surprisinglydurable for how luxurious they feel soif looks are a priority I highlyrecommend the tannestill cut boxer briefs okay next upnumber three we have me undies boxerbriefsso speaking of good looks beyond theseare also very good looking like thetanne boxer briefs they're made from ablend of micro Modell and elastane sovery stretchy I'd say even more stretchythan than Tanny very comfortable verygood-looking I have noticed that theyrun a little bit small compared to otherbrands so keep that in mind if you'rebetween sizes you might want to size upnow listen these aren't as lugsas the Tani's but they're also abouthalf the price so definitely a lot ofbang for your buck with me on these theother thing that I like about these isthey're available in a bunch ofdifferent colors from classic solidcolors to more saturated bold colorslike this to crazy patterns like youknow tiger stripes and just forreference my actual waist measurement isabout 29 inches usually we're at 28pants to accommodate for vanity sizingand these are size small they fit but Iwould not want them any tighter so therethey are noticeably a little smallerthan the other brands but they haveplenty of stretch so like I said ifyou're in between sizes maybe size upokaynumber four we have ex-officio andspecifically the give-and-go boxerbriefs now as you can see these havesome wear and tear I've had these foryears actually first got these when Iwas going on a pretty intense hikingtrip in Zion and Bryce national park Igot these from REI after hearing aboutthem from Tim Ferriss he swore by theex-officio brand so I gave these a shotand he was right these are my go-tounderwear for travel by far so I usuallywhenever I travel I bring two pairs ofthese and they served me really wellbecause they're very dry they wickmoisture they don't hold odor andthey're very easy to clean they dry sofast you can hand wash them in the sinkand they're dry in like less than anhour's you can put them back on theseare nylon spandex blend so kind of likethe Lululemon underwear they have alittle bit of four-way stretch but notas much as like Tanny or me undies andalso like the Lululemon underwear theseare not sexy you know they're not thebest looking underwear in the world butthey're workhorses so I think if you'rea traveler if you'd like to pack lightI'd highly recommend ex-officio given gobox or briefs you know if you're goingon a big date maybe leave these at homeand choose something else like me onthese are tanning okay and number fivewe have kind of a newcomer actuallyribbedteeg2 cool nylon boxer briefs now I've beenwearing ribbed tee under searched foryears now Ino the founder Mike Schwartz I waspretty excited when they announced thatthey were launching it underwear line Iactually helped Mike dial in themeasurements for the small size so theysent some samples over and I gotta saythe final product is amazing and theseare different I mean you can probablytell like they even look different thansome of the other offerings on the listthey don't have that big elasticwaistband they have this kind of hiddenblind hem waistband it's very minimaland it's super comfortable there's nopinching it doesn't have like a sharpedge so it doesn't dig into your skin atall there are no tags so nothing to youknow cause any itching on your lowerback one thing I've noticed there are alittle bit lower rise than some of theother brands on my list so you know justkeep that in mind in terms of looks Iwould say that these are better thanLululemon or ex-officio but they're notas handsome as me undies or Tanny but Ithink they're super super comfortableand just really well-made so definitelycheck them out okay and then thehonorable mention is this pair from Saksand I wanted to include these becausethere's this whole category of men'sunderwear that has basically extrasupport built in to the inside so asSaks which is kind of this minimallining that sort of creates a pouch foryour boys now some underwear makers havebuilt their entire brand around thisextra support for example there's abrand called sheath that has some prettycrazy pouch work going on they have thisone main pouch for your boys pluralanother smaller pouch for your boysingular and then even a little fly inthe front so you can get in and outeasily now personally I'm okay with thetraditional pouch list underwear youknow I don't really need that extrasupport but some guys swear by it so youknow if it's something you might likedefinitely try it out I do keep this onepair of sacks in my rotation justbecause I think they're prettygood-looking and they are prettycomfortableI like the minimal pouch but becausethey're so thin I've noticed thatthey're not quite as durable as otherunderwear and they're very soft so theytend to ride up a little moreand there's definitely a risk of wedgiegoing on with these so these wouldn't bemy first choice if I was gonna do likeyard work all day I might reach forthese if I was going on a date the otherthing I do like is they they have extrasmall sizes so if you are a very smallguy you might want to check out sacksokay so those are my top five pairs ofunderwear I hope that helps you decidewhich pair of underwear to buy and ifyou have any opinions if you've triedsome underwear that wasn't on this listthat you really love definitely let meknow down in the comments so I can trythem out and until next time staystylish[Music][Music]you,26,UCZ3mO3Au6JbLoUEsKisnbKA,emily si,0,1,0,23,"['try',

somereally cute items fromtarget amazon and a few other storesthat i'll go through sojust know that in this haul there's amix of more high-endworkout clothes and some great dupes andlower costfine and so it is a few things tomention so for sizing i am a size sixi'm pretty mucha true to size size six or like a mediumwherever i goif i get a six or a medium i'm prettymuch going to be goodthere are definitely times that i fitinto a size four or a size eight likedepending on the storeum and you know ladies we just havecertain days that we're justdifferent sizes and that's cool so justan fyi i willtalk about you know the fabric thesizing of these different brands so thatif you are a different size than mehopefully this is still helpful to youand so i'm gonna be showing you all ofthese outfits on me i will link belowall of the items that i can a lot ofthem umshould be able to link so you can goshoppingafter the video so i'm going to startwith free people because i'm actuallyalready wearing a free people crop andif you didn't knowfree people has an entire athletic wearum workout clothing line called freepeople movement i'm obsessed witheverything i've ever purchasedfrom this line because it's such goodquality but mostly becausethe colors in their line and just thestyle is very earthy in bohemian i thinkoften with workout clothing it's a lotof like spandex materialblack colors gray colors greens navieslikefree people has so many variations ofcolors like mutedearth tone so this is actually theirhappiness runs crop i have it in a fewcolorsi love it it's this ribbed material andagain i'm going to show you these itemson me like standing in front of mymirror so you can seei love a lot of their ribbed materialsin their line um because it's justreally flattering and stretchyand so i am wearing the medium large inthis crop topfor a lot of their clothing they run umin two sizes either extra small small ormedium large for their free peoplemovement linei will say it's it has a lot of give soif you're somewhere in the middle likeyou can definitely do the extra smallsmallbut i personally love that it stillsucks me in at this sizebut gives a little bit of like breathingroom i just prefer that in my workoutclothes sotake that with a grain of salt and theni have this one you're gonna be likeokay that's the exact same thingbut i have this top that is technicallythis is like their oat milk color and itis a little bit lighter it's justso comfortable i wear this with jeans iwear it with working out i'll show youin a minute so again the same stylecrop the happiness runs um and thiscolor is desert dunei also want to note that with thisparticular crop the happiness runsthey have it cropped then they have it ithink it's called longer cropand if you have like a longer torso ifyou're taller i'm only five threeum you can definitely get the longercrop version and it'll still be prettyit'll still fall on you nicely um justtake a look on their website and seewhat's best for youbut love the material and style of theseso another crop that i have from themis the same material but it's adifferent style and it is called thefree throw crop topit's basically the same materialas you can see but it's a lower v-cutsuper flatteringreally great length to it i cannot waitto purchase more of these i justbought this one fairly recently in thislike lilac color all of these in thesame sizethat medium large option and it's so socomfortablelast up from free people is this set itis the good karmaset and you can buy these two itemsseparately but i absolutely love themtogetheris in the sand color again we'll linkbelow but you can see even the waiston the pants is this stretchy ribbedmaterial that isjust so flattering and the crop topis really cute as well as you can see itjust matches perfectlylooks so different from any other stylethat i've seenwhich i absolutely love it is in mediumlarge bothoptions i originally actually purchasedthese in the extra small small and itlooked really goodbut it did feel like thinner on my bodybecause i think it was a little snugso i thought it looked good but itdidn't feel great sojust an honest review there that if youprefer things beinga little bit looser on you when you'reworking out then definitely sizeup but if you like things really snugthen size down the material is is justreally forgiving so i think you'll begood either way so i love free peopleif you couldn't tell and i can't wait topurchase more from themum and i've just felt that the qualityof their clothing has been superconsistent and really greatso next up gonna talk about target andshow you some fun items that i havefrom them they have a really greatselection of workout clothesthat i think are you know definitelydupes for some higher end workout gearand so i have this purpleset from target you can see the color isjust so beautifulum it's a matching set that has a sportsbraleggings and then this purple crop topthat i did a little frontknot to add a little something to theset and i think it'sso cute really flattering and stuck inplace which i think is really importantwith workout clothesit's one thing to look nice but it'sanother thing to actually work for youwhile you're working out the size ofthis set is medium again i'm a prettystandard medium soum i think for target sizing it's prettyon par with my body um i will sayrandom that target bathing suits howeveri think are not true to size but that'sjust another thingand then just two crop tops that arefrom target and honestly idon't wear these working out i've wornthese doing yoga butagain like athleisure fun workoutclothes to wear not working out i'm afan of they are just theselittle tie-dye crop topsand i think they are so fun even justwith leggingsthey're that ribbed material if you canseei just really love a good ribbedmaterial because i think it's soforgiving and so flattering anythingthat's ribbed is for meyeah i just really think these are socute on the weekendsrunning errands um and that being said iwanted to just show you these big cozyzip ups because i love the look of a bigoversized zip up when you're wearinglike workout clothes whether you'regoing to the gym again frolicking aroundwhatever it ish m has really good quality zip ups umand soboth of these are from h m in extralarge size so that they're super baggyjustreally flattering again they look goodthey look trendy i think and i justthink it's a really fun way toum style workout clothes in athleisurehave it in this gray color and blackcolorfound them from h m and they were reallyaffordable like i don't remember thecost exactly because it was a few monthsago that i purchased these i find myselfwearing them very often soi will link those below so you can checkthem out if you like them next up isamazon and i'm really excited to talkthrough some of the good finds that ihaverecently discovered on amazon and amdefinitely going to be purchasingmore of in different colors the firstset is this blue if you can see it downhere this blueworkout matching set that is a shortsleeve cropand these like short little booty shortsituationthat is so cute and so flattering i'm soexcited about it to me they're like agym shark dupeif you couldn't tell it's a very similarmaterial in this set i am a size mediumit's very true to size i would not havesized up or sized downi just think they're so cozy i just gotthese in recently so i have not workedout in this set yetbut i did look at the reviews and itsaid that for working out you know it'svery good quality stays in placeso really excited about this set i thinkthe color is sounique it's like in person a very skyblueand i don't have any workout clothes inthis color i'm usually muchmore into pinks and purples but love agood blue apparently becausei'm very into that set so i'm gonna bebuying it in other colors it has a bunchofpink tones green tones grays blacks sodefinitely check that out on amazon andthe next set is the set that isall over tik tok but figured i wouldinclude it because i do actually reallylike it and i think it's a very goodquality for the pricebut it is this sand colored set thatagainyou've probably seen but maybe youhaven't seen it on someone's body thatlooks like minegot this set in a medium as well and ijust think it's really flattering andjustholds everything in place it has thisgrip material underneaththe bra and at the top of the leggingsthat is justmeant to shape your body and stick inplaceso i've worn this set doing yoga and ireally liked itso definitely check it out if you'relooking for a neutral set i'm not surewhat this would be a dupe of i thinkit's kind of its own thingum but i just think it's really reallycomfortable really cute i've also wornit underneath like a big oversizedsweater on the weekends cozying up withmy husbandso recommend this set as well so thelast two items from amazonare lululemon dupes for sure and they'refrom that brand on amazon that's likecrzyoga i'm pretty sure again linked belowi cannot remember all these things butthey are definitely the best lululemondupes that i have foundso both pieces these leggings and thiscrop top are definitelylululemon dupes for the align stylethey're just like buttery softand can definitely support you for aworkout or just be cozy however you wantto wear thembut i just think the material is socomparable to the align materialwhich everyone loves so finding a gooddupe for that that is not going torun down your bank account is alwaysnice in my opinionso i want to get more colors i kind ofstuck to some more neutral colors incase i didn't like itbecause i don't know that just feltsafer to me but iactually do really like these materialsand i have worn them i can definitelysay that theyare great quality and i will be buyingmore of them from amazon and also thoseleggings i did purchase when i wastraining for the marathonand i did training in them and i feltlike they were really good qualityand definitely did the trick while i wasrunning in crazy temperatures and allthat good stuff soalso that's another thing if you arereally into rigorous workout trainingsand things like thati would honestly say that these aregreat quality and a good option for youif you need a lot of them because you'reworking out a lot umso yeah i am going to be doing an amazonhaul video i think two videos from nowand i'm going to be including some of myfavorite amazon clothing piecesthat i'm not talking about today sodefinitely check that out tooplugging my own video yep next up is abrand calledbooty by bra bands and i knowthat she the founder um isfrom my area in the greater boston areabut i havebeen seeing a lot of people all over thecountry wearing her line which is socool to see she's actually from the townnext to meand i think that's awesome she's doinggreat things so if you haven't heard ofthis brand is what i'm getting atdefinitely check them out we'll link theproducts below butthey are incredible and the cool thingabout this lineis that the material is so differentfrom anything else and i will say that ihave been seeinga lot of other brands trying totake her style and like make it theirown um which is what everybody doesrighttotally fine but i will say that justfrom looking at other people with thestyles on them i don't think that it'sas good as her linein my opinion so i only have one top atthis point frombooty by bra bands and it is this whitetop it is in the croco skinstyle that is really cute and i have apaired with these cropped leggings thatare the original fabric and the only bigdifference between the two materials isjust that thistop material the croc skin is thickerthan this original fabric leggings soleggings are again cropped if you are myheightand um you know around 5'3 get thecropped if you like where this ishitting meon my leg so i have this in the tie-dyecolor and also in thismauve color same material it's theoriginal fabric just a little bitthinner thanthe croc skin material and socomfortableflattering again it fits all sizes youknow you don't have to worry aboutpicking your size because you'll knowthat it willlook great on you um and then i alsohave these leggings that areum just plain black but they are in thecroco skin so a little bit thicker andif you're just looking for somethingthat's maybe a little bit warmer in thewinteror something that is just going toreally suck you in go for the croc skinit's just a bit thicker but looks prettymuch the sameand so i have this in the cropped andthe regular length i will say that thefull length i usuallyroll up underneath my ankle because it'sa little bit too long for mebut it does get the job done and it'sgreat for the winter timeso yeah those are my favorite piecesfrom booty by bra bands and my onlypieces that i have right now and i planto purchase more as time goes onbut for now i just really love thatbrandall right and then last up is of courselululemon we cannot do a haul withoutlululemon the goatum and if you don't like lululemonthat's that's just fine toobut i can't knock them right they aredefinitely a more expensive brandbut the quality is just really good imean i've had lululemon leggings foryears that are definitely at this pointa little bit worn out that i'm not goingto show in this videobut i think they're just really goodquality and meantto last you a long time yeah i'm justgonna show basically my favorite piecesfrom lululemonum so that you can go out and get themor just i don't know hear an honestreviewfirst is the align crop top that i thinkeveryone knows and has heard about it'sjustthis dusty pink color um crop top that iwearpretty often i really think the qualityis justthe best out of a lot of crop topstyles that are similar to this so i dohave other tops from lululemon that arejust a little bit olderand i don't love as much anymore so i'mjust going to show you this top for thishaulbut paired with this top now are theseleggings from luluso these leggings are the swift speedhigh-riselegging from lulu in a size six and ijust really like the design of these ithink it's pretty uniqueand abstract which i just really likeand i think is veryflattering when you have differentthings going onon your bottom so definitely a funlonger pantthese are the align crops in like a sagegreen color i'm not sure the exactname of the color but i'll link it belowand again we all know a line is thatbuttery soft material that isreally cozy pretty flattering i will saythat a line is not meant tosuck you in it's really meant to just becomfortable soif you are looking for something that'sreally going to hold you ina line is probably not the best fit foryou but um i really just think they'regreat for lounging aroundand then last are these align bikershortsand the this length i'll link below it'slike their midlength biker short you can get them evenshorter than this and even longer but ireally love that perfect you knowmiddle of the road biker short lengthbecause it's flattering if you're takinglike a spin class it's not going to rideup too muchand all that good stuff so yes those aremy favorite lululemon pieces right nowand i will link them below um and so asmentionedthat was the last piece of the haul andum the last portion here so thanks somuch forwatching this video i hope that it wasexciting and helpful and all of thatgood stuffto just see me in these pieces and hearsome honest reviewsfrom companies that i really like i willagain mention i

of the walther that's pretty esteemedArizona Richard Branson Jerry SchwartzHoward Schultz is he asked for how doyou feel about keeping such company wellI mean I first look and I go why wouldthey ask me to be in that group and thenyou know and then I I have a hard timeseeing myself from the outside so whatnever occurs to me that I would be inthat group that I'm seeing that thatmaybe I do have something to add tosociety something to say something togive back I think as a person ages likeI am that more and more of it is passingon what I know at other people how muchof Lululemon success do to West Beach soyou made a mistakes with your surfcompany so they hopefully you wouldn'tmake them well I don't think that wasever planned that way I think that itwas a weird situation because it justfelt like every year at West Beach I wasgonna make money in the next year I wasgonna make mine the next year and so Ithink what it allowed me is when I had18 years of doing it that way it allowedme to make a lot of mistakesand I knew everything I didn't want todo and and all those experiences addedup to allowing me to start Lululemon andbe so much further ahead to get rid ofall the baggage and all the crap andjust stick with what really workswhere do you think the growth is I meanthink about it in the introduction we'redownstairs Michael talked about howthere's always some Lululemon clothingin his in the laundry basket his housesame in my house mm-hmmso you know you've got women who arebuying us off like crazy at some pointthere would be a saturation point withwomen and I know there's the you've gotthe the store geared towards youngergirls now mm-hmmwhere do you gowell I think part of Aviva is the otherone yeah Aviva's the small girls part ofwhat happened is that we we got into theathletic and of the world through yogaand so if you look at the whole athleticbusiness as a pie we were given a slicethen we own that slice which in Ibelieve in the consumers mind we've donea good enough job in that now we'rethere it's they're giving us the abilityand the approval to venture out soyou've probably seen on our stores wereyou know doing cycling we're doing somecompetitive swimso we're I mean really that isrelatively endless and huge can we fitit all into one store no are we tryingto figure it out yes is there's thisthing called e-commerce yes is itsolving issues yes but I think that Ithink where we're really focusing in onis is men I think men is the big futureand and men and fashion styling andathletics is coming together in a waythat hasn't happened beforeyou,26,UCxkZWLby4fBqbonmQgYcGYw,Sammieswishes,1,1,0,2,"['lululemon', 'scuba', 'hoodie', ""victoria's"", 'secret', 'pink', 't-shirt', 'american', 'eagle', 'top', 'charlotte', 'russe', 'flutter', 'sleeve', 'autumn', 'fall', 'haul', 'shopping', 'yoga', 'shorts', 'sammieswishes']","Fall 2011 Haul from Lululemon, Victoria&#39;s Secret, and more!",xIVmqq9k5pI,1476

choking stabwounds and was pronounced dead on thescene that makes it personal right whenthere's that like that 300 like what wasleft after 331 aren't you like likearen't you physically fatigued yeah likedoing that in general just swing yourarm 331 times absolutely it's probablymorecouple of misses in there I'm sure yeahI mean that is something that goes somuch deeper into wanting to killsomebody it's like insidious so let mejust tell a little bit about both ofthese people too that were found at thesceneso Brittany Norwood was anafrican-american woman she'd had pastcrimes before she had worked there for alittle while and then there was JanaMarie who was blond white she was agraduate student at Johns HopkinsUniversity like totally differentexperiences life experiences especiallyin this in Bethesda Maryland which wasvery very wealthy I kind of think aboutit like I grew up in kind of a wealthysuburb too just so sheltered and so Iremember like if there was anafrican-american person in our suburbthe cops would be like on it it wasreally I would imagine very difficult tobe a person that wasn't white in thiscontext so that's what we're workingwith right these two very differentemployees being found in two verydifferent situations at the Lululemon inBethesda Maryland so all of this moneywas missing from the source safe theattacks were what Britney said when shecame to consciousness was that these twoguys came in tried to rape them tried toassault them took all the money and leftand she said that they were just likeracist that they were rapists that theywere murderers robbers it was kind oflike this hyperbolic count it was likethey're everything yeah they're all thethings that they're that bad people yeahexactly it's like they were I don't knowlike their names were Hitler both ofthem you know okay well no but she gavethis account so everyone was going crazyand Bethesda everyone's like everyonewas being profiled everyone was lookingI can't imagine how nuts it must havebeen because also this place had neverhad anything like this such an intimateand violent murder maybe a possibleshoplifter mabel's yeah or like awhite-collar like tax like skimmingmoney you know off of some businessthing I know business all right exactlythe fact that the men would leaveNorwood alive with only a few injuriesafter inflicting so much on Murraydidn't make a lot of sense in additionthe men only use tools found in thestore during the attack which was a bigtip tip off of a for the copsthey hadn't brought any weapons of theirown norwood told police that she andmarie had returned to the store Fridaynight after he closed to retrievesomething norwood had forgotten this wasa lie we'll talk about it later whenthey did she said two men had followedthem into the store assaulted them bothand killed Murray again manhunt ensuedpolice looked into local data on skimask sales - because she said that shementioned that they had ski masks on soshe couldn't say what they look likethey offered a hundred and fiftythousand dollar reward for anyone whoknew anything about these men aroundtown who are going and breaking intoLululemon's they even tailed a man whofit the description of one of thekillers but then all this stuff kind oflike degraded right seven days later onFriday March 18th police arrestednorwood because her story just didn'tadd up the only bloody footprints policefound were Norwood's and those made bythe shoes that were found at the crimescene and those were a size 14 like yogashoe I didn't realize you did yoga inshoes but when I was in a Lululemon Iwas like oh this is 14 female yes okay14 Mills gigantic right I don't knowwhat is the average male shoe sizemine's 11 okay which is on the largerside okay so like a 10 or 9 yeah it'sprobably on the larger side exactly yeahso I was in the Lululemon I was like ohyeah they sell shoes it's more than justyoga in there not to say this is an adfor Lululemon it's most certainly is notyeah I left I was like whoa I wouldprobably don't physically jar by theprice don't need our publicity nothey're doing just fine despite thismurder do you want to mention theirpatreon - while you're at patreon.comslash Lulu's LeMans murdering bethesdapeople watchthat's very long yeah but I got it doyou got it yeah okay good mmmso Norwood was arrested her story didn'tadd up these bloody footprints werefound her own bruises after examinationcuz they took her to the doctor appearedself-inflicted and she'd been tied up insuch a way police said that she couldhave done it herself neither woman itturned out was sexually assaulted aswell so again her story is breaking downso then she was convicted of murderafterthis opening arguments in thefirst-degree murder trial of BrittanyNorwood charged in the killing of herco-worker jana marie she the otherpretty gruesome details were brought tolight holding the bloody rope foundaround the slain woman's neck and amerchandise display rod Wu used to bashher skullState Attorney John McCarthy said bloodtrails show that how the 30 year oldvictim tried unsuccessfully to escapeher attacker through a back doorso essentially she had this rope and shehad a merchandise display rod that shewas beating her and torturing her withas she tried to escape also this isLululemon from what I know from my onetime in the lemon in Malibulike it is it's a place for fit womenit's a culture of fitness and wellnessand kind of like bullshitty New Agestuff would you give it would you say itthere's any semblance of like acult-like atmosphere of being like youknow if you were you lemons you know youyou know you wear other things and thenyou're not yes and this is somethingthat also was brought to light kind ofduring the trial and all of that reallyall the things like this is why I likethe case so much like you know classrace culture all of that kind of wasbrought to a head in this specificmurder case so they talked very veryspecifically about how jayna was tryingto get through the back door of thelittle lemon she was bleeding Brittanywas attacking herthey were also 107 defense wounds causewhen Murray tried to fend off her attackwhen the medical examiner examined herand she said it's the most that she hadever seen in one woman so this was likea fight like a straight-up like thiswoman was fighting for her lifeMurray was trying like she was trying tosurvive and then Norwood did not wantthat to happen and it's like what causedit was so violent again in a culturethat felt the least violent you knowthink about how long this took Gina isalive through almost all of this mr.McCarthy who was a state attorney saiddescribing how 8 separate items found inthe upscale yoga inspired apparel storewas used as well as weapons sorrythe last wounds are from knives this wasnot slow this was notpainless this woman struggle to survivelet's take a little break there and thenwe'll get back to the results you knowwhat I'm thinking is like the fact thatusing the items from Lululemon they'reprobably somewhat specific to Lululemonin a sense yeah their own thing makesthe whole thing more I don't I don'tknow what it makes it it just makes itlike it's just personal and yeah so Ithink when you're like we all thinkabout murderers we think about weaponswith murder we think about a gun a knifea rope you know we think about peoplebreaking in we think about just we takemurder and a lot of the things aroundmurder and put it in its own littlecategory but I think when you're usingthings that people use Kamui differentlyto murder people or in a totallydifferent culture you're like that isvery disturbing you're using your ownspecific culture kind of a guess isbeing used against you I guess but thething you use to dress a mannequin Idon't know but yeah it was used againstyou which is it has to make it even moreit just makes the whole thing moresinister and I makes him moreinteresting absolutely and also for ourpodcast specifically exploring thesethings through place thinking about alittle lemon and experiencing it for thefirst time and being like oh this islike [ __ ] upscale retail store thisis not the site of a murder no it's notlike a you know for like oh thishappened at a 7-elevenyou know in Camden New Jersey you'd belike oh yeah get it totally gay I meanunless somebody was like they you knowthe Snickers bar yeah I mean it's in the7-eleven with the Snickers bar so thatmakes it yeah like you said that makesthe place very atypical and superviolent yeah really is it really isreally contrary yeah and I think aboutthe malls that I grew up with and likeif this had happened again in theupscale mall like talk about Chicago oneof our fans is from there there's asmall called Old Orchard which is thisferry we would go there to get our aboutMitzvah and Bar Mitzvah [ __ ] because itwas much nicer than the Wisconsin mallsbut just having this place where you'relike oh this is safe this is safebecause we think it's all a perceptionto only oh now people that are alreadywell off or they don't know they don'thave want for anything so they'reexactly they're not gonna risk anythingexactly so the perception of what thistown and this mall was is also reallyfascinating okay so while attorneys fromMiss Norwood hinted in the months beforethe trial that they might pursue aninsanity defense attorney Douglas woodacknowledged his in his openingstatement that his client had attackedMurray but that she had not planned tokill her so that's where they were goingwith they were like not premeditatedjayna was killed by Brittany but notwith premeditation mr. wood said duringthat fight Brittany Norwood lost itthere is no doubt about that she lostcontrol yeah no [ __ ]331 wounds the defense argued for aconviction of second-degree murderclaiming the attack was not premeditatedthe case received intense media coverageand was commonly referred to as theLululemon murder in January 2012 Norwoodwas sentenced to life imprisonment withno possibility of parole in a publishedopinion on April 29 2015 the court ofSpecial Appeals of Maryland rebuffedNorwood's request for a new trialeffectively ending her direct appealoptions so after this it all happenedright and everyone's like holy [ __ ] andalso there was this weird sense ofrelief in the town to where it wasn'tjust some strange man it's got so manythings it was relief but it was alsolike oh one of us did this but was sheone of us really because again it's likepredominantly white very upper classesis not the background that BrittanyNorwood came from but again they werelike we isolated who this is they'rebeing sentenced they will not be at sothen Brittany Norwood kind of like cameclean on all this stuff so basicallywhat she said she spoke publicly for thefirst time since the killing addressedMarie's family before learning herpunishment before I go to prison shesaid I needed to hear how deeply sorry Iam so in the after-hours confrontationapparently sparked by Norwoods attemptto steal a pair of yoga pantsauthorities said she bludgeoned shechoked and stabbed Murray using at leastfive weapons to inflict again more thanall of these 300 some separate wounds totry and conceal her crime Norwoodtracked size-14 sneakers throughMurray's blood to make it appear as if alarge person had been there she thentied herself up gave herself a few minorwounds bound her own handsankles in a restroom in itial ii fooldetectives with an elaborate tale abouta pair of mass murderers so until thecover-up unraveled police considered novictim and she was treated as a Becca noshe was treated as kind of like a heroalmost which again must have been such ait was such a turn until it's like herode a murderer and people were veryafraid but she came clean abouteverything that happenedso she was alive laying in the bathroomwhile her co-worker bled out andeventually died in another room which isso crazy so you can imagine and it'salso some theorizing about theirrelationship to as coworkers and againthis is where the cultural thing comesin this is where difference in race andbackground come in the idea of like okaythey're there that night after the shiftNorwood had stolen yoga pants Murrayconfronted her a white woman ofprivilege can vote confronting a blackwoman who did not have the sameprivilege especially in the context ofLululemon where it's like you know hiread somewhere that they had such astrict culture it's like no so if youdrank soda yeah that's gonna bring uplike what is what what hoops needed tobe jumped through I think like I think Irecall that you don't just work thereyeah you live it you you have to be a ofa certain disease I think people makefun of or Senna parodies of us is likeyou know like The Devil Wears Prada yeahthing like that oh absolutely I feellike this is you can't just be oh soyou're you know a thin attractive youknow about yoga pants not a no yeah yeahyou don't have a criminal record no noyou know you have to you know be youhave to kind of live the lifestyleaccording to Lululemon exactly and andthat means a lot of different things alot of well yes exactly but both thesewomen were like again very attractivevery intelligent women so it's like Iget how they were both hired but againit just goes to show the facade and alsojust the facade of like being in thereand all those mantras like they have abunch of like mantras and they havethose bags which they talk about a lotand they have like all of this like it'slike if you when I was in there I waslike oh what if I wanted to just buy onething and it wasn't like a set of thingthere they are kind of like shoving thisdown your throatlifestyle because yeah buying one pantsit like isn't enough there it's like ohyou want the set of like the pants andthe headband and like there's so manylike things like American of power waslike a little bit like every night yeahmaybe there was a certain like kind ofat least marketing culture around it inthe people that were I mean I've been tomm-hmm a lot of American Apparel ISMyeah sure we like their t-shirts yeahnow so Wow well is this an ad forAmerican Apparel I don't think theyaround an image i n't abandonedwarehouse in LA but so yeah so I thinkMaria Norwood they work together rightMarie realized the nerd had stolen somepants you know would got defensive likewho knows exactly what happened butsomething ensued were it escalated to apoint of death really and then she hadto cover it up and then she was kind ofvictimized in a way that made her bealmost hero like and then that allunraveled I think you get you get to apoint where you're you know you're likeI'm just gonna steal some yoga pantsyeah after hours so like it's not yachances of getting caught which would beI'm close with somebody that works inthat field we're dealing with internaltheft shoplifting on a big scale yeahI've also you know once upon a time whenI was a child I used to shoplift a lotoh I did do yes I got you know I mean Igot a little in out of trouble for thatgave up my evil ways but I look at younow what what yeah I should I should goback to it yeah the what people will dowhen they're caught yes is they wouldyou know I don't think it's like fiveblu-rays or a bunch of diapers orwhatever what people will do to toescape prosecution is a lot yeahdefinitely it's especially wanting tokeep this job in this job it has a highlevel of acceptance I actually was doingsome research on how much they get paidat lemon ah I don't know specificallywhich I also in my mind it was like theyget paid like [ __ ] and like this is butI don't know I'm not sure so we're notsure how much you needed the job I alsodid some research on Norwood and there'sa lot of theorizing around her being asex worker her doing a lot of things tomake ends meet so you think about thelevel of desperation when getting caughtand needing a job and what you would doto make sure that went away I'm gonnayou know if the thing was like I justwant tosome passes like it keeps like now I'vegone so far I got yeah the bands are atleast by the way it's $78 at leastthat's the low end of their yoga pantsand I want a pair that's like very badlyain't yeahthat's like they're on sale like youcan't get the right size yeah exactly sothey are very expensive I think they goup to 250 dollars for a pair of yogapants that's we're talking big bucks Imean it's the yoga should do itselfexactly it'd just be an automated yogapant you can get out of it and theyfinish the yoga for you yeah and thenyou just sleep and yeah and just begoing Moscow mules I don't know why thatcame up my mind I don't know you'rethirsty thirsty anyway so this is areally fascinating thing she's still injail there's a foundation for Murray andher family and they've spoken out a lotof about this but it's really it's it'sreally sad and very fascinating and alsogoes to show that like you think someplace is safe or a nice quote unquote ormoneyed or whateverit ain't no it ain't hard lesson learnedwhat made you go in there there Rose inMalibu it's just living my life I knowit was in a shopping mall there and Iwent to like get some like coffee orsomething and it was right it was like aSephora lemon it was one of those likereally expensive Greek yogurt places andI was like I should pop in yeah seemaybe I'll buy something how was thehouse the like the the employees how wasthe culture aggressive yeah like youwould think I mean I guess notaggressive to me now like knowingespecially like you know when you signup for something or like when you'regetting aggressively emailed or textedabout things it was just it was veryretail II it's very like can we help youfive minutes later can we help you doany help what do you do like and they'reeverywhere there's actually what Ireally was surprised at as how manyemployees are there there there werelike six employees there and it's not avery big store it's kind of small butthey were all watching they were all ontop of it well I guess for now you haveto stick with Old Navy right yeah Igotta get those old navy pants nobody'skilling for

hey guys today I'm going to do aLululemon haul I absolutely love buyingFitness clothes and Lululemon is thecompany that I prefer the most out ofNike and all the other high-end brands Ijust think we lemon to me is where Iwould prefer to spend my money I justlove their material I love all thethings I purchased in the past and theydo have a sales section so actually allthe things I'm going to show you today Idid find in their discount section whichis really great I checked in a few timesthis is like three separate purchasesput together alright so the first thingI'm going to start off with is theirwhat the sport short so these are shortsthat are meant for working out so I gotthese in size 6 and these usuallyretailed for $58 but they were 39 in thediscount section so these are reallynice I love the material I really likethe color so there are a little bitlonger you do have a bit of an inseam afew inches so it's not as short as theirbooty shorts you have pockets as well onthis one so you have a really nice widewaistband that says lululemon athleticathen you've got the little pockets ontop which shows the size you can putkeys or a dollar or two in there youhave bigger pockets on the side as wellso you could put a phone comfortably inthe side pocket so these are good I'dsay for cycling or running just good forthe summer and I really love the color Ihave a lot of black and dark workoutclothes it's really nice to have somebrighter bottomsnext is a sport bra so this one is theall you need bra so I got this insidesex it was supposed to be fifty twodollars and I got it for thirty-nine sothis is a really nice comfortable sportsbra there's a little bit of nettingdetail at the top they're pretty skinnybrought like the straps are pretty thinand they come together at the backreally nicely so this one I wouldsay is good for small chests so ifyou're a size a or B I think you reallylike this one what's interesting withthis bra is it doesn't come with anyplace to put in the removable cups Ithink it might just be a little bit toothin in the front part for them to fityou do have enough coverage though soyou'll be okay without them but ifyou're looking for something for supportthis isn't the bra for youalthough Lululemon has a huge variety ofbras some are for really big girls verysupportive sports bras this one's justfor light support so I really like thata nice hot pink color you can't go wrongwith that okay so I did get another pairof shorts so these ones already run fourdays short so these are in size six aswell these are supposed to be $68 and Igot them for 49 so these are really niceand comfortable I have similar shorts tothis in black so I really like thesethese are really comfortable so they area short sort there's the front and theback so these come with a really nicezip up pocket here so you can put inyour keys if you have a small iPod oranything you don't fit in there and inthe front you do have those smallpockets as well so that's really greatthese come with a built-in underwear orlike bathing suit kind of things so youdon't have to worry if you're running orworking out in these doing squats oranything that they're gonna be toorevealing you're already fully coveredinside so really great they're nice andairy they have like a cut that comes upa little bit higher on the side so theseare really great for summer for workingout for running great materials are justawesome for summer I'm definitely goingto wear them a lot the black pair I haveI wear those all the time and they'rejust really really comfortablenext is this tank top so this is their acool racerback this is supposed to be 42and I got it for 24 which is reallyreally great so half price and Iactually really like the color so it's abasic whyshape I'm sporting the sports bra tanktop you can trace her back so I reallylike it I like how thin the back is someare a lot wider and I just really likeit's very comfortable it doesn't have abuilt-in sports bra or anything so it'sjust really nice and light I've worn itto work out it's so comfortable it'sreally nice and long which I appreciatebeing six feet tall I like my tops tonot kind of lift up in my stomach when Iwear them so I really really like thisand also considering it's such a lightcolor it's not see-through at all soI've worn like a black bra under thisand it wasn't see-through whereas a lotof like wife beaters they're reallysheer so I really like that and it's avery like artistic kind of print soreally excited I've won that quite a fewtimes next is this tank top so and thisis their a dancing warrior tank so thisone was supposed to be 58 and it wasdown to 29 so another one half price soit's a really nice pink tank top withthin straps and there's a bit ofdetailing on the back I'm not sure ifit's gonna show while holding it upprobably not but like a crisscross anddarker like ribbon so goes down the backof it and yeah really nice so as I saidwith the sports bra most of them haveplaces for the cups so you can seethere's a little opening there and alltheir tank tops also have this reallynice like vent in the chest which Ireally enjoy when you're working out ithelps it feel a little bit cooler it'snot too like hot and yeah this is areally nice tank top really nice andlong so I'm going to wear this a lot itwould be great for yogait's a light support once again so ifyou're bigger you could wear a bra withit but with the cups you'd be okay withthat just alone okay and the last thingis the inner essence crop so these aresupposed to be- they're going to 59 so I really likethe wide waistband really similar tothose blue shorts that I got so theseare crops that go just to the kneewhereas a lot of their other crops go abit longer I tried on size 6 with theseand it was too tight it's a really tightfitting pant they didn't have size 8 soI actually went for size 10 which iscrazy but they actually fit me reallywell so I don't mind so you've got thiscool detailing on the side and I justnoticed that there's a little pocket uphere so in the waistband you can go inand it's a really big pocket it goesdown to there so you could definitelyput like an iPhone or anything thematerial feels like kind of like theirregular pants mixed with like a sweatpant so it feels really really cozy andcomfortable and I like the detailing onthe bottom I think that seam makes itlook really flattering so those are allthe things I purchased recently I hopeyou enjoyed this haul thanks forwatching and I'll see you in my nextvideo,2,UC-aK6A7vntWJZVbRDgcNnmA,BA

and I was going to wearthis new sweater so and you can't tellbecause of course it's cloudy and rainyand dark and so I'm having put all theselights on but I do have like a brightpink lip and brown all brown I shot atbrowns and a little bit of white and itried i tell you i tried to do my hairso many different ways i tried to dolike a black headband like a I've got asoft one to do kind of like a BrigitteBardot I tried a big bun I just couldnot get any of it to work so by thattime I had to just pull it back um andit's just I washed it last night so it'skind of frizzy say I'm going to do aquick outfit of the day and then I'mgoing to answer a few questions that Igot multiple times I'll be like Dorothylululemon leggings which feels so goodthey really do and these are the sizesix and they fit I mean I'm not going toget the force but I really think I couldwear for they're not they aren't supersuper tight like the Spanx or anythingand I've got on just like a longlayering tank and then this long sweaterthat's Vince Camuto i got it at billsand then the shoes I have on or just mycomfortable gianni bini boots and sothen i'll have my black balenciaga bagand then for accessories I have on mySheila fish all hoops and I had someonewrite me this morning that on it costthem a lot in extra shipping and allthat kind of stuff to get it sent out ofthe u.s. so i might see if i can inquireand see if i can sell them by a chance Idon't know if I'm you know sometimes youjust have to be big enough but i wasthinkin if the girl can sell them onebay maybe I still could and I still Iordered some stuff from Jenny bird Iordered I love the things that she sentme so much that I ordered some to put onmy website and they sent them outyesterday from Canada ups so I'm hopingI'll get them by fridayand i want to show you those because ilove them i also got in the Lee Elenabracelets with the turquoise and Pythonso i'll be putting these on my websiteand okay so questions I've been asked alot one is the sweater that i wore inFriday's video that gray one came fromthe gap and I'm sorry I didn't say thatit was the first time I'd worn it and Ilove it it's kind of its kind ofdesigned to kind like a sweatshirt butit's a sweater and that was a small sothe next time i think i would probablyget a medium I don't know it was kind ofnice that it was fitted but it was fromthe gap and they have lots of goodcolors including that really brightpaint which would probably the next onethat I got and then several of you ifyou'll notice our Christmas tree isstill in process um John usuallydecorates the very tip-top because evenwith me with my little grabber that weuse and my stool I couldn't geteverything up there and last night weevery night we've been shipping say lastnight we shipped until late and I wecouldn't get to it but he does have thatthing that you guys were talking aboutthat you get at home depot that is likethe lightkeeper I think he bought thatlast year and we cannot find it so thatreally led to the Clark Griswold thinggoing on because he was so frustratedthat he couldn't find it and then hewent to lowes and home depot and theywere sold out so by that time he was sodetermined I mean he just had that crazylook in his eye and he just replaced allkinds of fuses and bulbs and thenyesterday when I was going through Ifound the little pack of fuses and bulbsthat came with it he had gone and boughtmore he had even bought lights and wastaken off the lights he was just youknow going nuts but I told him what yousaid last night he said that's what Ihad that's what I can't find so anywaybut we're going to deal with it I thinkthere was just a few out and so it stillit looks good we have a few I haven'tput the actual bulbs on there yet but welove it it lights up the whole room andlet's see Rachel k I still have some andI've ordered some more today I've hadseveral of you ask me does it work foroily skin and the answer is yes it workswonderful matter of fact I would gear itmore you know for oily normal to oilyskin than I would for dry if you did dryit would be good with maybe a liquid ora moisturizing foundation over it butit's wonderful for all the skin that'swhat i have is ole et zone then I had abunch of questions about the brighteningpowder from Bobbi Brown I use that as afinishing powder it doesn't have anyshimmer or any Sparkle I really don'tknow even I guess it's just all thecolors combined what brightens is justit evens out your skin tone it iswonderful and it does not even I've hadpeople ask me you know was it like theslaw right spotlight or anything it'snot like that at all it does not takethe place of a highlighter it takes theplace of your finishing powder and thensomeone asked me what was the differencein that and the laura mercier with thelaura mercier is more of like afoundation powder it's to give coverageand it leaves more of a luminous finishthe brightening powder would be go overthat especially like me after I spraywith the pics + then I go over with thelet me back up and maybe you can see mymakeup better yeah then you can on yougo over it with that Bobby Brown and itjust helps you know finish it and let'ssee I just want to get questions thesame questions over and over I try tojust maybe answer them in a video so ican get everybody's hmm what are some ofthe other ones that i had a lot of youcommented about you know we're in somuch makeup and that tutorial just itwas just a made-up look like today ismore of probably my everyday i just haveon Bobby Brown taupe and Lancome drapeand our lashes are just they're justsimply easier I mean I would ratherspend the time putting these eyelasheson than my scary any day and then when igo to take my makeup off at night it'sjust take this off take thatand it's I mean everything comes offwith my bioderma so it's just very muchsimpler and I guess that's it so I hopeyou guys have a good wednesday i willprobably be back here i know i'll be byfriday but i doubt i'll be abouttomorrow i'm going to really try to geta lot of stuff done and then it's acouple of days I just wanted to sayhello and tell you that i liked thelululemon leggings for

[Music]hi everyone abby heretoday i'm going to be reviewing thelululemon theyoga mat bag but before i get startedmake sure to hit that subscribe buttonso you can stay tuned to all my newvideos dropping weeklyand so you can help the channel growthis is purchased in the colorheritage camo jacquard max blacknow this can be used to hold virtuallyany yoga mat not just lululemon onesum basically i'd recommend this for anymat that is a five millimeter thickor less it does have a pretty snug fitwhen you do put it in here so i wouldn'trecommend going with anything over thatso this mat right here is fivemillimeters it is a little lemon matand when you do unzip it this doesn'tzip all the way down it onlygoes to here so one great thing aboutthis yoga mat bag is that it is verycomfortable onit has a nice carrying strap that is anice thickness and you can definitelyadjust itif you want it shorter or longer on youso it's definitely great for when you'reon the go or if you need to just throwin your carthis is comfortable to carry it and itdoes have an excellent water bottleholder right hereshowing you that it can fit a standard500 milliliterand it goes right in um there's nothingleft over so it completely covers yourwater bottleand you can tighten it and loosen it asyou see fit to make sure that it issecure in hereadditionally there is a pocket righthere this pocket can definitely holdlike a full-size cell phone if you wantto put your cell phone in hereit could also hold like cards snackseven like a little towel if you're goingto the gym and you want to use thatthereall right guys so i just want to giveyou guys an alternative in case youaren't ready to purchasethe lululemon yoga mat because i do knowit is expensive i also have a cheaperalternative here for youso this is the buoyance yoga mat bagthat i did purchase off of amazonand i want to show you guys kind of alittle bit of a comparison to see thedifferences between them sothe one major difference i could showyou guys is that this one completelyzipsall the way downso it makes it super easy to put in youryoga matwhile the lululemon yoga mat bag onlyzips half of the way down to herethat's one thing i really don't likeabout it i don't know why they just putthe zipper here i think they should haveput itall the way down to the bottom justbecause it makes putting your yoga matineven easier so i'm to do a little bit ofa demo and show you guys howeasy it is to put this in hereand i do want to mention that this bagfrom amazon the buoyancy yoga mat bagit does have a higher capacity so thisone is able to hold like basicallyalmost any yoga mat size even if it'slike7 10 millimeters thick it can definitelyhold in hereand to zip it upand just showing you guys in herethere's plenty of spaceso even when this is like fully zippedthere's lots of space hereand there we go this one also has apocket right here um this is like a nicebig pocket it goes from hereto here my whole hand fits in here soyou can definitely fit your phone inhereum any snacks cards anything like thatandon the bottom here it does have a pocketso for this pocket right here um here isa standard 500 milliliter water bottleand it fits right in so it's not bigenough for me to like close itwith the water bottle inside but it doesfit in no problemone last thing i want to mention or talkabout is the strap the strap right hereis nice and long and it is adjustablefor sure but i will sayum it's not as comfortable like to usewhen you're carrying it on your shoulderthere's just not much padding here andthethe strap is kind of thin so that's justsomething to noticedefinitely not the exact same quality asthe yoga mat bagfrom lululemon but i would say it'spretty good especially for the pricethat you're getting hereand i have had this one for about twoyears now and it's still going strong soso i'd say the quality is great guys andit comes in a bunch of different colorsguysnow i'm going to go ahead and put myyoga mat in the lululemon yoga mat bagso you guys can see kind of how it worksso the one thing about the lululemonyoga mat bag is because it is very slimfittedso you have to make sure that your matis tightly round but this one is not soit's not going to fit in thereso i'm going to go ahead and justtighten it up a little bit when i doroll itso i've gone ahead and rounded a littlebit tighter but on thelike advantage side for the amazon yogamat you can definitely fit it in whenyour mat is rolled really loose becauseit's designed to fit you know biggermats so here we go[Music]guys so i have had this yoga mat bag forfive months now and it's definitely verydurable and is holding up greati'm using it to store my yoga mat i liketo put my yoga mats in bags rather thanthe straps becauseit keeps them kind of dust free whileyou are storing themand i want to say that this materialhere is great it's definitely easy towashyou can hand wash it or you can throw itin the washing machine on low and thenjust hang it to dry whatever you preferit's a great material all right here'sthe tag for anybody who would like thatinformationit is also water repellent which isgreat if you're ever caught in the rainwhile you're carrying yoga mat bagso i've shown you all the differentpockets and kind of zippers on this bagso i do want to say that it's excellentfor holding all your yoga matsit's comfortable to hold and it fitsthem snugly and securelyalright guys so considering the pricequality the color the functionality thedurability and the ease of usei would go ahead and give this littlelemon the yoga mat bag a 9.3 out of 10and i definitely do give it a thumbs upif you're looking to buy the amazonbuoyancy yoga mat bag i've gone aheadand put the link in the description foryou to use so in america this starts at10.99and in canada that starts at 15.98 andif you guys are looking to you know upthat quality there and you're looking tobuy the lululemon yoga mat bagi've gone ahead and put the links in thedescription for you to use as welland if you want to see me reviewanything else from lululemon just dropthat in the commentsthanks for watching guys and make sureto like comment and subscribe

lululemon athletica is next now this isan interesting one because it's adesigner and retailer of technicalathletic apparel especially yoga clothesfor women so we're talking about premiumbranded high-end stuff here veryexpensive but much beloved by itscustomers and its customers access thebrand through online sales as well asabout 250 stores the company started outits life in Vancouver British Columbiain Canada but it's expanded across theUnited States and it's got a handful ofstores internationally in places likeAustralia New Zealand and Dubai marketcap is only nine point zero sevenbillion dollars so quite small stall byinternational standards price earningsratio 34 also not paying dividend soanother high-growth type companyestablished only a couple of decades agoby a guy called chip Wilson rattedalready done well in the surfing gearbut started this company because he sawyo ger coming right from the beginningit was high end stuff and as a result ofthat they have had some issues in recentyears because when you set a very highmark with regard to your clothing and avery high price point you do have to beconcerned about occasional quality slipsthey had a bit of a disaster about 18months ago with a bunch of pants made ofluan which is the stretchy fabric thatyoga pants are made from which weren'tquite up to scratch but as I said beforethis is a company that is extremelyhighly regarded by its customers so allof that stuff hardly even matters nowthey're not only in women's gear this isa lululemon man's athletic gear which Iwould say is my favorite top it'smanufactured from a fabric which isextremely easy to wear can I saybeautiful seem work amazing fabricstechnical gear light as a feather andjust fabulous for running in in the warmweather which we have most of the yearhere now the company looks expensivelet's have a look at the five-year chartyou can see that it's been up down andleft right and sideways it's the kind ofthing where when a company like thisdoes well it's very high expectationsbut I think it offers an interestingentry point inof a way which is similar to the waythat adidas does part of the drama inthe middle there was not only related toproducts they also found the chip Wilsonthe founder that I mentioned earlier wascausing a lot of trouble in thebackground he was anxious about thecompany's current CEO Christine day hehad her fired replaced with someone elsethen he was making noise about whetheror not the stores were selling the rightkind of stuff basically he agreed tostep down and sell his shares to aprivate equity group and to place abunch of his other shares in the marketso that kind of death is created by someloose shareholding also resulted in alittle bit of a slump with regard to theshares but that chip Wilson factor isnow out of the way he is basically nolonger on the board and a soul down issheer so I think this one additionallyadds exciting opportunity and for mesomething you ought to consider althoughI recognize if you've going into theinternational markets for the first timethen clearly Nike is a much better andmuch safer play but Lululemon issomething for you to consider as wellgood that's it hot on Lululemon,25,UCsba91UGiQLFOb5DN3Z_AdQ,CNBCAfrica,0,0,0,0,"['4357290270001', 'hotstocks', 'Hot Stoxx', 'yoga clothes', 'Paul Theron', 'lululemon athletica', 'Byron Lotter', 'Vestact', 'Sports Apparel sector']",Lululemon Athletica - Hot or Not,0ONaVTmdIZw,23

that you can stay up todate on all the videos as I post them solately I have been getting back into theexercise swing of things this is myexercise move and I have started yogaagain namasteit is so much fun and I am so addictedto it already we have been doing it forabout a month now I do it in my housewith the best yoga teacher ever her nameis Rebecca and she owns a company calledgypsy life wellness and if you aresearching for yoga in my area you haveto have to have to reach out to her shealso does like massages and likeprenatal stuff and things like thatshe's just amazing so I will include herinfo down below and definitely check herout so since I've gotten on this wholelike yoga I'm all like Zen now I ran outof like exercises because if you know meI am NOT an exerciser I snowboard in thewinter and I love it and when I stoppedI was like what's happening all of asudden I'm not as good anymore and Idon't really like exercising and stufflike that but I kind of like forcemyself to just get into this yoga thingtry it out again I used to do it a whileago and I have fallen in love with itagain I'm doing like my shadow rangasand afterwards I do like shavasana andit's like oh this is amazing and I feelso good and so ready to take on the dayand I suffer from a lot of anxiety andyoga is a huge huge stress reducer forme and it really like just makes me calmand focus and when I go onto my mat I'mlike okay I gotta be here I can't be inthe million other places that I want tobe in like thinking all the crazy thingsthat I think about throughout the dayand so it's just been really amazing formy mind my body and my spirit since I'vebeen working out more I have kind ofstarted running out of clothes to wearI feel like that's the natural thingwhen you're yeah you're always likewashing clothes and stuff and I wantedto pick up a few new things that I couldkind of take from theJim or from the yoga studio out intoreal life because um I'm generallyrunning around and after that I have tolike go do shoots or do some work or dosomething like thatrun errands and so I wanted to have likecute little things that could go fromboth things and be more of like my lifestyle looks flow into my favoritecompany Lululemon and I ordered a fewthings from there that I thought wouldbe perfect for what I needed and for mystyle and yoga because I love the insideof ish and doing yogaso the first bottom that I got they'reso cool they're my favorite I'm reallyinto the whole like paneling thing andwhat is it like the mesh details that itlooks like like you see your skin butthen it's like black and then mesh andthen black does that make any sense likethose leggings that are just kind ofreally cool and I found these fromLululemon and they're kind of along thatline but a little more unique and theybasically have like these cross bitsdown and they have a little bit of meshright here and then these like line Idon't even know what they are but theystretch out and then go across my legand they look so cute I love them somuch and if I'm kind of more petite thanby five so I'm just like average um theykind of they're like the 3/4 cut the 3/4cut on my legs and so they don't go allthe way down but they're not likecropped either and I love that look andlove wearing them with like um tennisshoes or just flip-flops and they arereally really cute so I'm in love withthis it's also like had this charcoalgray color so it's not all the way blackit's not a lighter color so I feel likeit would kind of go with any shirt thatI have any top that I have and I justthink they're so cute it also has thishigh waistband so it goes up over mybelly and I like you know keepingeverything in so this is really few andthen the back is just regular this wholecharcoal gray it's really stretchy andit's pretty thick but because of thispaneling it's not going to be like waytoo hot because that funnel nuts and airand it's really really nice and the topthat I got to go with it was this topit's just like a gray basic top I feellike everyone has this if you likeLululemon you probably have this top itfits really nicely it's kind of looserdown at the bottom so it's not totallyhugging you and then the back has thisreally cute crisscross and this is likemesh again which I wasn't expecting itto be like this but I really likeit and it crisscross right there andyeah it's just kind of like your basicgray top and I feel like it's so cutewith those bottoms and I just love itand then the second outfit that I gotare these bottoms I saw these these arethe first things that I saw and I waslike oh my gosh I have to limit orderthese are too cutethey're called the hugged fit andthey're also 3/4 length so they fit itlike the perfect length on my like legsand I just feel like they're reallyreally cute and they also have like ahigher waistline so they covereverything really nicely and I thoughtthis design was so cute like just thislittle blue striped and it'd be reallynice for like summer and you could wearit obviously with purple like what I'mwearing right nowor with blue and I really really likethemoh also on sizing so in these I got fourand then the other ones I got a six itwas just because they only had six inthe grey pair and then in this they onlyhad four and I did the same with thetops and they both fit me the six kindof fits me a little better it's just alittle less snug and um it has it has alittle gift to it which is nice becausethat would be a small in Lululemon thana four is an extra small and yet smallfits good too and I really like it thiswas the only thing they had and I lovedthem so much so I just went ahead andordered it but normally I would be mostcomfortable in a six and the top that Igot again it goes along with the wholelike a mesh style that I'm in love withright now it is this this was actuallyfun clearance so definitely snag it ifyou like it because there's probably nota lot not a lot left and it's thisreally pretty royal blue color I don'tever wear a royal blue but I feel likecuz I'm a brunette it goes really nicewith my hair and I but I would try itand then had this really prettyv-neck cut down the center and has abuilt-in sports bra go through the topstoo so that's really nice and in theback is like this crisscross um strappysituation it has a tons of mesh on theback so it's kind of more open but stillcovering everything up because I likebeing modest but I also like trying newthings and kind of forinching out in my looks and I feel likethis is the perfect combo to do thatwithout me feeling like Oh too exposedso I really really like this and it kindof did the same thing with a fit it goesout a little bit instead of saying snugagainst your hips if there weren't it alittle bonus here for you but I alsofound these pants on anthropology let mebacktrack really quick I have beenobsessed with the marbled look lately Ilove everything marbled I want like amarble foam case if I could have like amarble laptop case a marble everything Iwould do it I just really really like itI think it's so cute and so in right nowwhich is fun I have like marblenecklaces oh just everything marbleplease get me all the marble so goingalong with the whole marble thing I wassearching searching searching forleggings that had marble and I foundthem in anthropology here they are Ilove them so much I wanted it to be morelike white and then just have a littlebit of marble detailing through it and Ifeel like this is perfect it has just alittle gray light gray it's not too likecontrast earring like that and they fitso nice they're really thin they'rethinner than I thoughtso either don't wear underwear with themI don't know if other people wearunderwear I do but if you do like don'twear underwear with these or wear like anew colored underwear because yourunderwear will definitely show and thesego all the way down so they're long andthey fit they like kind of kind of cinchto the bottom which is really nice andthen they have this nice thick waistbandtoo that covers everything up and I gotthis in the size small and the brand iscalled define your inspiration so Ibought with your anthropology

tight pants right now but all thetimes when I'm editing I like to becomfortable you know what I mean or justlike relaxing a lot of doing in thewinter time and they're so soft thething about these is safe - it's reallyto be careful with watching them becausethey can shrink easily so make sure youlay on this playing teacher becauseyou've been lots of following inInstagram if you don't follow my
