26,"So I purchased a pair of aligns off of Poshmark. I knew it was a risky purchase. I shop on Poshmark frequently, and I‚Äôd found one of my ISOs in my preferred length at a decent price. Not a steal, not outrageous $$, just a good enough price for a pair of aligns in great condition, as described. The seller‚Äôs pictures were vague, but they didn‚Äôt have many listings and I thought it might just be a new seller who‚Äôs not great at selling yet. I‚Äôve gotten some gems through that kind of listing in the past, so I rolled the dice. 

The package came today and... yeah. Not great condition. They‚Äôve clearly been through several rounds in the dryer. Significant pilling, several patches of snags in the fabric. The size and length are accurate, but the condition is more truthfully described as fair than great. As in, they‚Äôll work, but aesthetically they‚Äôre not what a reasonable person would expect great condition pants to look like. 

I decided to keep the pants because I‚Äôm tired of searching for the pattern, and I have the knowledge and skill to fix them. They won‚Äôt look like new, but I can repair them to the point where they‚Äôre not embarrassing to wear. 

And then I left a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è review and a detailed description of what was wrong with the pants. And now I‚Äôm feeling guilty. I don‚Äôt want to trash a seller, but I feel like leaving a falsely positive review, or no review at all, doesn‚Äôt help anyone. The seller never knows that their listing was not acceptable, and future buyers don‚Äôt know that they really need to ask for clarifying photos with this seller. 

What do you all think? Should I have just tried to return the pants rather than leave a negative review? And what does ‚Äúgreat condition‚Äù mean to you?

Considering this is typically an annual in-store/video chat promo, with COVID, you can imagine Lulu probably doesn‚Äôt want to be attracting large crowds into store and unnecessarily putting their employees at risk.

They had a lot of outerwear, some dresses, some pants, and the usual racks of leggings and bras/tanks. They did not have any special pricing on anything, except for accessories. For things like single pack underwear and scrunchies, there was a 3 for $15 deal, I think.

413,"I was taking a look into fb sell groups and found this post of this girl selling a pair of hotty hot shorts with a visible stain at the liner from the previous owner, the worst it was she was selling them at $50 (almost retail price). I don't know if this was a""rare"" color or she just lost her mind but it was really gross trying to sell something like that. Let's not allow the resellers feel okay trying to sell this kind of items, I understand the hype but no brand is worth to buy a pair of shorts which been clearly very used and the previous owner left her personal mark on them.

529,"Just wanted to talk to you guys :) 
I had my last shift at lulu on Sunday 

I‚Äôd been with the company for 5.5 years! 
Met so many of my best friends and it was such a positive influence on my life 

The reason why I left was because for the past 2.5 years I‚Äôd been working fulltime in my career and only worked at the store on weekends
It‚Äôs time for me to enjoy the fruits of my labor and spend time with my husband and cat on my days off! 

Most of my fellow educators were either pursuing higher education or working towards a specific goal of theirs so I never felt like I was surrounded by ‚Äúidiots who worked retail‚Äù which is some feedback guests have had for us in the past LOL 

The majority of us either are currently pursuing a bachelors, a masters, studying for law school, studying for medical school, or any other ambitious goal. We absolutely love being at work surrounded by like-minded people who strive every single day to be better than our yesterday. 

Frankly my disposable income in the past two years has increased so much that I have more clothes with tags in my closet than I do clothes I can wear especially since the majority of my clothes I can only wear while I‚Äôm at Lulu or at home haha 

My career goals are to return to Lulu at the corporate level so I will not be gone for long but for my wallet sake and my FedEx driver sake it is time for me to go.. 

I have enjoyed my time on the sub Reddit seeing all of you people slay in your fit pics, answering questions, and Losing sleep over restocks and drops

Thank you for making my time here enjoyable I will now have to dip because I cannot purchase anything at full price even though I have sweat collective due to me being a personal trainer on weekday nights LOL

582,"This is my first post on this group. As a powerlifter, having high performance leggings/tights are a must to withstand long, grueling workouts. I have used multiple brands over the past few years with one issue being that the waistband would slide down on the men tights from these brands. On a recent trip to a Lululemon store in Milwaukee, the employee Kristen and I had a excellent conversation about powerlifting and leg day workouts. After explaining the issue I was having, she recommended that I try on the women's Swift Speed High Rise Tight. I laughed a little to myself, but Kristen said you be surprised, let me know what you think. After trying them, I was blown away. They fit amazing, do not slide, fair amount of compression, and powerlifting proof. Over a 2 hour powerlifting workout, I subjected them to heavy squats, leg presses, hamstring curls, and they performed extremely well. The material can handle thick neoprene knee sleeves for, thus showing their durability. Overall, even though I own 2 pairs of Men's surge light tights, the Swift Speed High Rise however are in a league all their own. You will not be disappointed. These tights are a 5-star.",2021-03-04 12:10:40,4,Swift Speed High Rise Tight Review,0.97,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/lxpmzw/swift_speed_high_rise_tight_review/

I have the FTBW high neck and i love how it looks but it's hard to put on because of that extra fabric. So im worried that if theres also a long line its gonna be even harder to put on. Also not to mention that I cant wear it under certain shirts that have a lower neckline cuz then it just looks weird.

With the FTBW long line, I never tried it before but is there a thick band at the bottom where the long line is? or is it just a piece of fabric? cuz im worried it would be uncomfortable if theres a thick band around my ribcage.

And personally I think high necks look more flattering on me since im pretty flat chested, whereas with the regular neck lines theres kind of a gapping space between the bra and my chest. But i hate having to struggle to put on the high neck versions, so its hard to decided lol.

I think the most important is your measurement. Like chest ( bra size) waist and hip.  Because even with the same height and weight people carry weight in a different area. Height is great to see how clothes fit.

729,"The pandemic took a big hit on my mental health. After two postponed weddings, job uncertainties, and lots of emotional eating I found myself at my heaviest weight, hating my body and finding comfort in ‚Äúloose & comfy‚Äù clothing. 

I have know about lululemon for years, but never though I was the right ‚Äúsize‚Äù for it. After joining Reddit and finding this community, I realized that‚Äôs I‚Äôve been missing out. I did my research, bough my first pair of leggings and for the first time in many many months, I felt beautiful. I started then experimenting with tops, sport bras, and becoming more of an active reader on this community and wow, y‚Äôall motivate me so much!!! 

As for now, everything I have fits, (a tad tight here and there, and some rolls I want to get rid of) but I‚Äôm motivated to see progress in clothes that already make me feel pretty. I am starting to work out consistently (I love weight training and I‚Äôm finding ways to weight train at home because gyms by me aren‚Äôt open) and I am also doing what I can to practice yoga and meditation to connect with myself and ‚Äúforgive‚Äù myself for how I‚Äôve been treating my body in the past year. 

For anyone on a similar weight loss/self love journey, I‚Äôd love to hear how you keep yourself motivated and accountable every day. Do you follow any particular practices/routine or people on IG/YT who motivate you? What are you favorite at-home strength training workouts to follow? 

I am also trying to look my best for my (fingers crossed) November 21‚Äô wedding so I need to keep pushing myself.

873,"Just picked this up yesterday in store in a size 10. Without going into too much personal detail, I am not a C or a D but I am a little chonky so I wanted full coverage. This bra is pretty heavenly. For the record I don‚Äôt wear wire bras so I am used to the uni boob not pointing at the ceiling look. That said this bra does not separate as the tag claims. Pretty solid uni boob but because the bra is light and not compressive it doesn‚Äôt smoosh you down either. It‚Äôs soooo soft. It‚Äôs like aligns on your boobs. Like aligns, it is not really compressive but still hugs you. I have no issues with shoulder straps slipping or band riding up. The band is very comfortable while not being flimsy. This bra really feels like your wearing nothing yet it holds everything in nicely. 

My only complaint is that they should make the cups like the Like a Cloud bra with the foam layer built in. The crappy inserts are a pain and I have to adjust them every time I put the bra on. If it weren‚Äôt for that I would‚Äôve bought another one already.

Hey y'all,

I got a discount code for Lululemon through Strava, ""To celebrate your hard work, lululemon is rewarding you with 25% off your next purchase through May 21. Grab your discount and keep on moving.""

Link is universal and I've tested it on NEW accounts I've created. You'll see the discount be applied in your cart.. I don't know if it only works for new accounts but just make sure to use the link through a guest / incognito browser, which is how I was able to get the link to work for multiple account. Let me know if it works for you and/ or if  your orders ship.
  
**A few notes collected from comments below:**

* Should work with account you currently have. Just copy paste the link into browser and login to your account. If that doesn't work, try opening a guest/ incognito browser and then logging in again. Last resort, if that doesn't work create a new account but add ‚Äú+lululemon‚Äù at the end of your normal email so my order confirmation goes to mailbox. For example: isappleworthit +lululemon @ email .com

* Seems to only work in the the USA and Canada. There might be a UK / Europe link floating around. 

* There are no confirmed reports of orders being canceled but individuals are skeptical that it may happen.

* You can use it MULTIPLE times but the second/ third/ fourth time around you'll have to make a new account!",2020-05-14 22:50:13,1026,25% Off Lululemon Link,0.98,933,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/gk10a9/25_off_lululemon_link/

1031,"If you were looking for a reason NOT to buy more - this is it. Yes, I‚Äôm talking to those of you who stay up until 3AM for WMTM restocks. Those of you who constantly stalk the website and subreddit looking for an excuse to buy more. Just because someone else has the finances to afford it, doesn‚Äôt mean you do. 

I fell into this state of depression where buying lululemon became my way to cope. I fell, and I fell FAST. The hype was unbelievable and this subreddit fueled it. Before I knew it, I was having a panic attack every month figuring out how to pay off my credit card. My closet was over flowing with items which had tags still attached for months. I was waking up every night at 3AM trying to catch the latest restock. Items were coming to my door almost every day. I kept telling myself ‚ÄúI need to stop‚Äù but I wouldn‚Äôt actually do it. 

Something changed when the new year hit. My priorities changed and I completely stopped. It‚Äôs been almost 3 months since I have bought something and it has been AMAZING. I feel so free. 

So again, if you are looking for a reason to stop buying - THIS IS IT. Enjoy what you have. Take the damn tags off and wear it. Work out, lounge, sleep, do WHATEVER. You already did the damage, now ENJOY it and STOP BUYING MORE. I promise you it feels SO good to take control and not just buy due to FOMO. 

Stop laughing and joking about how much you spend and how high your credit card bill is. Stop joking about how you don‚Äôt sleep because you stay up waiting for a restock.

1053,"As a frequent member here I see a lot of posts here about differences between fabrics, what type of leggings are best for x activity, recommendations for a first time buyer, etc. so I wanted to make a guide to be able to refer to! I tried to be as objective as I could by basing some statements on popular opinion, but also injected some of my own opinions. Note that I used a guide written by former Lululemon educator [u/carbsandcaffeine](https://www.reddit.com/user/carbsandcaffeine/) in another subreddit to format this, and I also copied and pasted some of their legging descriptions (ATRP, Speed Ups, and Train Times) since those are all legging types I've never tried before. This only discusses Lululemon's core leggings line (from the US, as that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm based) and not any of the seasonal styles. 

# Fabrics

The best way to start is by picking out a fabric based on what activities you're looking to do in your leggings. Lululemon recommends washing all leggings on cold and with like items (aka. don't wash with heavy cotton towels) to extend the life of your leggings. I also would add that turning them inside out and air drying them will help and also will cause the fabrics that pill, to pill slower.

* **Luon:** A soft, stretchy, cottony (but not made of cotton) fabric. Come in a few different types, such as light luon, luon, and full-on luon. Because it's so thick, people who live in colder climates may prefer it. Not very breathable, so not recommended for any kind of sweaty workout. Good for low impact activities or lounging. In my opinion this is my least favorite type of fabric because it will pill over time, is too thick for working out, and attracts pet hair like crazy.
* **Luxtreme**: Sweat-wicking and quick-drying, but is slick and smooth compared to Luon. Great for all types of activities, especially sweaty ones. Known for being durable over time and the most repellent fabric to pet hair. Personally my favorite material as I have some pairs from 2017 that I wear regularly and still look brand new.
* **Nulu**: Super stretchy fabric that is ""buttery soft."" Often described as feeling naked or a second skin. Most comfortable material for lounging or casual wear but also can be worn for low impact activities. Known to pill easily over time.
* **Nulux**: Created to be the best of both worlds by mixing the durable, quick-drying properties of Luxtreme with the buttery soft feeling of Nulu. Feels super light (described as ""weightless"") and flexible. Great for running or any kind of sweaty, high impact activity. 
* **Everlux**: Meant to feel cool on the inside (like Luxtreme) but soft on the outside (like Nulu). This fabric is advertised as being the fastest drying and highly breathable.

# Leggings

If you can, I highly recommend going into a Lululemon store to try on items. While others can give guidance on how a style tends to fit, all bodies are built differently so it‚Äôs always best to go in person where you can try on one/multiple styles before committing to purchasing. If you‚Äôre in person, the educators will also be able to help guide you to the right size/style. 

If you‚Äôre not able go to a store in person, you can use Lululemon‚Äôs online size guide which tends to be pretty accurate. They offer free returns so you can try several items and return what you don‚Äôt like, but you just have to front the cost. However do remember that WMTM items are final sale, so it can be risky trying a new style from WMTM. 

* **Wunder Under:** The type of legging most people start with, as they're the OG legging. They come in **Luxtreme** and **Luon** fabric, which are good for different activities as mentioned above. They don't have any type of pocket or waistband detail, which make them great for dressing up without any obvious signals that they're workout leggings. While it looks like Lululemon's website only offers these in high or super high rise, they were previously made in mid and low rise so be aware when buying second hand. People have reported that luxtreme WUs can slide down on those with a more curvy body type, but as someone with a straight up and down body I‚Äôve never experienced this. 
* **Align:** The most popular Lululemon legging. They are made of the **Nulu** fabric, which is extremely soft and next-to-naked feeling. They are extremely stretchy and have no compression which is why some people choose to size down. However this is not recommended because it can cause them to degrade faster due to constant stretching. They are also known for pilling very easily, especially when worn during high impact activities. They recently updated the fabric to be more pill resistant, however people have reported that the new style is more slick/less soft than the previous version. 
* **In Movement/Invigorate:** In Movements were recently discontinued and were replaced with Invigorates, which were advertised as ""In Movements with pockets."" They are both made of **Everlux** fabric. Invigorates are known for having a slightly tighter waistband than other styles, so they're ideal for people who have a large difference in their hip to waist measurements. Some people will also choose to size up because of this, but most recommend sticking with your true size. They were originally designed for indoor spin classes but are good for any kind of activity, especially sweaty ones due to the quick drying material.
* **Wunder Train**: The newest addition to the Lululemon legging line, and quickly becoming a fan favorite. Made of **Everlux** fabric, they're known for being as soft as Aligns but as durable as Luxtreme. This style is also known for running small, so it's recommended that you try this style on in person to find your correct size. They have gained popularity really quickly because they are good for everything from lounging to sweaty workouts, and are often recommended to people who want Aligns that don‚Äôt pill. 
* **Fast and Free**: These are made from **Nulux** and feature a draw-string waistband, side pockets, and reflective paneling. They might have a slight bit of compression when you first try them, but the waistband will stretch slightly over time and leave you with a ""second skin"" feeling. They are very lightweight and smooth, and have an almost naked sensation.  They are designed for running, especially at night due to the reflective paneling. However these are my favorite leggings for indoor cycling because the material does not pill when rubbed against a bike seat.
* **All the Right Places**: These leggings are high-rise, made with **Luxtreme** fabric, and feature reflective detailing and side pockets. These pants are very high compression and are popular because they hug you in, well, all the right places. These tights were designed for running and gym training.
* **Train Times:** (Currently discontinued in US/Canada) This pant is made with **Luxtreme** fabric, and though it doesn‚Äôt come with any side pockets, it does have mesh paneling on the side for breathability and a drawstring waistband. It‚Äôs also mid-rise with a hugged compression. This pant was originally designed for HIIT, gym training, crossfit, and bootcamp, so all you OrangeTheory, F45, and Barry‚Äôs Bootcamp folks rejoice! These tights are also great for running if you do indoor treadmill/elliptical running.
* **Speed Up:** The Speed Up tight is a medium-rise pant made with **Luxtreme** fabric and comes with a draw-string waistband, side pockets, reflective paneling, and high compression (many people size up for Speed Ups). You can probably guess by now, but these tights were made for (outdoor) running. In addition to the side pockets, there is a small (kinda useless) zippered pocket in the back. The reflective paneling will help keep you visible when running outdoors in low light.

1060,"Hi friends! While at work today I packaged approximately 100-150 orders from my store that were from the sale, and I drew a heart on every packing slip as a little love note to you all ü•∫ lmk if you get one üíï",2020-07-09 20:08:00,67,Packing Slips,0.96,760,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/hoek3n/packing_slips/
1061,"Hi everyone! I have been emptying my bank account to buy lulu (not literally but I regret how much I‚Äôve spent) since 2013. I noticed there is always a lot of buzz on here from people trying to grow their collections so I wanted to tell you guys what I have learned about my own buying habits in that time.

1. You will never regret buying the neutral color. I know it‚Äôs always tempting to buy seasonal colors and colors or sale, but neutral colors will remain in your rotation the longest. The $10 off on a pair of ink blue leggings might seem tempting, but 10/10 times you will wear the black leggings more often. Try to limit your collection to a pair of black leggings in every style you like, and a few colors that you love in styles you already know are your favorite. If you‚Äôre debating between a bright color and a neutral choose the neutral. (I consider the camo prints, black, navy, cassis and gray sage to be neutral).
2. Spring/Fall are a LOT shorter than summer/winter. Speaking as a girl who owns *too* many cropped lulus, I get so much more wear out of my shorts in the summer and my full length lulus in the winter than I do any of my crop styles. I LOVE the look of crop leggings, but nothing beats full length leggings you can commute to the gym in in the winter. If you‚Äôre debating between crop and full length always choose full length.
3. Lulu tops are a lot more overrated than leggings. I own a ton of lulu tanks and with the exception of a few like the ebb to Street tank, they‚Äôre not worth it and I would‚Äôve been better of buying plain dry-fit tanks. A lot of them are see-through if they‚Äôre not black, thin, and just overall get way too wrinkly to be super convenient. If you‚Äôre debating between a top and pants always choose pants.
4. Buy accessories sparingly. As (relatively) cheap the water bottles and headbands are, you usually don‚Äôt need them. Limit accessories purchases when you can.
5. The jackets are worth it but consider wearability. As SUPER COMFY as the define nulu jacket is, can you sweat in it and wear it out? Make sure you try to stick to the more durable fabrics like nulux, everlux and luxtreme to make sure you can get the most wear out of your jackets. On these stick to neutrals as well.
6. Shorts are the area to splurge with colors! Given you wear them the most in summer, and you can always match them with white or black tanks, shorts are the place to buy all of the colors your heart desires. Shorts are cheaper and rarer than leggings, so these are the one item where I recommend always scooping them up if you‚Äôre on the fence. They don‚Äôt restock that often and I personally get as much wear out of my more colorful shorts as I do out of my more neutral shorts.
7. Unless you use a large gym bag every day you probably don‚Äôt need a lulu gym bag. I am always stuffing gym clothes in my work bag / different totes / a backpack so if you‚Äôre like me a lulu gym bag will go unused (even if it‚Äôs cute). If you‚Äôre a backpack girl I do recommend the backpacks though!
8. Lulu always brings their best items back. I remember when I was OBSESSED with black camo and snagged black camo aligns when they first came out after religiously checking restocks on tuesdays. Those got me addicted and I tried to buy up everything black camo when I could. Now guess what? Black camo is a staple in most of lulu‚Äôs items. Lulu isn‚Äôt stupid - they know what we love and I truly believe everything that we rave about will eventually be brought in full time. I‚Äôm looking at hotty hot high rises next :)
9. If you‚Äôre tight on money DELETE THE APP and unsubscribe from this sub. The best way to stop spending money is to avoid temptation. A sale of $20 off $120 leggings isn‚Äôt that great of a deal, as much as we get excited when it happens.
10. The new lulu stuff will always be more exciting and interesting than old lulu stuff. It‚Äôs never a bad idea to save a gift card until you find something you‚Äôre absolutely in love with.",2020-07-13 17:31:04,98,Lessons from a Seasoned Lululemon Shopper,0.96,757,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/hqo9wk/lessons_from_a_seasoned_lululemon_shopper/

1134,"This is basically in beta mode because it's probably got some kinks to work out and I'm sure I can improve performance.

**WHAT IT DOES:**

* Scans Lululemon website for all WMTM items.
* For each item and color, there will be a row in the Google sheet for it.
* Each row will contain your basic info plus things like which sizes are in stock or out of stock at the time of scraping. Please note that if you're checking it at like 5pm, the in stock & oos info are going to be wrong.
* Scans at 3am everyday plus 6:45am on Thursdays. Please let me know if you have suggestions for better times. I can also trigger it to run manually whenever.
* It takes approx 5 mins or less to run.

**NOTES:**

* I have it running on my computer so if my computer isn't on for some reason, it won't update... I'm trying to get it set up on AWS so I don't have to worry about it but have been running into some issues. We'll see...
* My code was written to allow compatibility with regular priced items too but it takes a lot longer to run the program. If you guys are interested, I can create another version to just run regular priced items.

**Okay and now the link:** [Lululemon WMTM Scraper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15EJLz_LOzGfGS69PZvCfvTSuUXex0AAS3Q8pEh996rM/edit#gid=2143049979)

This is my first personal project so it's still a WIP. Let me know what other kinds of features of functionality you are interested in!

Edit: I am so glad y‚Äôall love this!! üíïüíï this was a really fun project to do, so I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall will get some joy out of it!

Edit 2: *For everyone asking for the code!* it‚Äôs a bit messy and I want to organize it better but I‚Äôll post it here from my GitHub when I make my edits!

Edit 9/25 8:18 AM: Sorry guys! I made a debug change yesterday that broke it (oops) and it didn't finish running at 3am. Running it now.

Edit 9/27: MEN - I kept getting request time outs when I tried to run the script with men's WMTM enabled so I assume there's a limit on how many requests my scraper can make within a certain time. I may have to make a new spreadsheet with men's WMTM only. Please be patient while I set it up!

Also for others asking for the code, I'm making some edits which I'll post soon. Trying to break them up into some functions.

Edit 10/19: SORRY guys! I know it took forever but I've been busy.

I wish I could say that I was self motivated but really it was just putting on my favorite lululemon leggings (after ordering more at the sale) and just going out there and walking. 

As trivial as it might be the future vision of being confident enough to post a fit pic and my wild bluebell wear everywhere 1L (here Wednesday!) is what is pushing me to be better.

The positivity of this subreddit really helped me realize it‚Äôs ok to be where I am at today and to push myself to be better without hating who I am today. 

So thank you everyone and I hope your Monday had a lot least one reason to smile even if it‚Äôs a shipped order or your favorite shorts!

1191,"Hi everybody! Just wanted to post a reminder to shop responsibly in the next couple of weeks.
Do not buy just for the sake of buying, the fashion industry is one of the major contributors to world pollution and water consumption. 

I personally buy from lululemon because clothes last a long time and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúfast fashion‚Äù to me. However, I see a lot of people buying a ton of stuff, usually impulse buying from WMTM and then worrying about their finances. 

It‚Äôs not just about affordability, but think about the environment too. 

I‚Äôm not discouraging anyone from buying, I hope you all have a happy shopping season, just remember to shop responsibly and avoid getting into the trap of just buying because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcheap‚Äù or because you got ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù. About 84% of clothes just end up in landfills or incinerators.

Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on items that you might never wear or might end up in the bottom of your closets, maybe donate some of that money to a cause you care about!

1222,"Oh my gooodness!! I wanted to share a sweet story that you‚Äôd all appreciate. So I tried out the virtual shopping assistant beginning of quarantine bc I had a few questions and immediately connected with the employee helping me. We started following each other on ig and just kept up from time to time, always hypin each other up on our posts/stories üòÇ. I‚Äôd always ask her questions about products and she‚Äôd alwayssss help me out and even help me order them! How sweet, right?? 

Anyway today we were messaging each other and she wanted to video chat bc she had a surprise for me. She basically told me lululemon sent out an email to their shopping assistants and that they can gift one of their shoppers (who they made a connection with) a $130 lululemon order - for FREE! And she chose ME!! 

I was srsly smiling from ear to ear! Not because of the free lulu (ok yes that too lmao) but bc I made a genuine connection with someone through the damn shopping assistant feature and it just makes my heart happy that she equally enjoys my company and obsession for lulu üòÇüòÇ

1304,"Hi, I‚Äôm a LLL educator, have been with the company working part time for 3 years alongside my career job. Which means I‚Äôve been through 3 holiday seasons, sales, but this is the first pandemic we‚Äôve been through. I just want to give y‚Äôall an idea of what is going on behind the scenes because there‚Äôs a ton of blaming LLL here and negativity for things that are out of our control. 

WAREHOUSE/DISTRIBUTION CENTRE:
- Has been working on a skeleton crew since March 
- Only now has upgraded to 30% capacity 
- Let‚Äôs say at most, from 50+ employees at warehouse we are now at 15, for example. And that‚Äôs with most warehouses for other big stores too (looking at you, Aritzia)

SHIPPING/SHIP FROM STORE/INVENTORY
- Because of COVID and store closures, we‚Äôve been sold out of core pieces (Align shorts, WT, etc) FOR MONTHS now 
- Sometimes we are scheduled 3 hours BEFORE OPEN to look at all the orders coming in online that are in our area that have been directed from the website to ship these items from store if we have it, and FedEx it out to you - this is how we‚Äôre helping Warehouse

REFUNDS:
- In store has taken 1-3 days to show up on statements
- ONLINE REFUNDS ARE TAKING 30+ DAYS, this is our new normal wait time, we understand it‚Äôs long but we‚Äôre also in a pandemic 

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BEHIND THE SCENES AS AN EDUCATOR:
- We are also working as a skeleton crew in pods of 5-8 people which is nothing when malls are on reduced hours
- Sometimes we are understaffed, please be patient with us if you are waiting longer than usual in line
- We are getting people in/out of the store as quickly as possible, right now, we don‚Äôt want you to take your time browsing and doing 57 laps around the store to kill time, this is not the time for it.. we‚Äôre still in a pandemic (you‚Äôll have all the time in the world to do that post-pandemic)
- Yes, we are taking returns (quarantining items) and exchanges and we may seem a bit more lax but it‚Äôs literally to keep you guys happy
- No, our Lulu branded masks we wear in store aren‚Äôt for sale at the moment

At the end of the day, it is a privilege to own LLL pieces especially right now. You should not be going broke or out of your budget range for a new pair of Align‚Äôs. LLL will be here for you when the pandemic is over, I promise ü•∞. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk lol.

EDIT: Wow! I did not think this would blow up, I'm honestly so happy I was able to provide some transparency and help you guys out.

1353,"Like the title says. Recently with all the BF/CM drops I've found myself making excuses to stay up farther into the night to try and catch some restocks/new drops in my size before they sell out completely. I'm a college student and last week I was on Thanksgiving break, so this was an option for me. Yesterday night, however, I did the same thing, and- surprise, surprise!- was exhausted this morning when I woke up for my classes. 

I know almost everyone on this sub has something we have to do the next day. So why do we make the choice to stay up til 3, 4 AM to try and catch a random restock? I'm 'lucky'- I'm on the West Coast, so I have to stay up a *little* earlier than everyone on the East coast. It's still definitely not healthy.

And what's the point? To save 20, 30 dollars or so on some athleticwear? The atmosphere created by Lululemon is a very competitive one, other people have already mentioned how they might manipulate their stock to create FOMO. But really, do I *need* more Lululemon in my wardrobe? No, I don't. In my case, as a student, it now seems a little absurd that I am staying up till the early hours of the morning, damaging my health, for the *chance* to *spend money* on something that I already have so much of. When I look at it like that it seems silly. I will not be staying up tonight to wait for a restock. 

My purpose here isn't to discourage you from staying/waking up to catch these restocks. I know nothing about you. I am just suggesting- maybe it's a good idea to take a step back and consider how much you really want these things?

I truly don't mean this in a bad or judgmental way. I really do like this community and the wonderful people on here. All of this is just a suggestion.

1357,"Back in September (on the 23rd) I ordered a swiftly long sleeve in this fire blue jewel tone.  It never arrived, even after I got notification that it had been delivered.  I called Lulu and they were super helpful. They have a protocol whereby they have to investigate and track the item.  About three weeks later they called me and told me that while they could either refund me or send me a replacement shirt in a different color, the  beautiful blue color had already sold out.  Bummed out, I just took the refund.

Fast forward to December 24th.  I went down to the lobby of my building and found a very badly mangled and beat up LuluLemon package addressed to me.  I wondered if somebody had sent me a gift because I hadn't ordered anything.

&#x200B;

And there it was, team.  My beautiful blue swiftly long sleeve.  Three months late and in a package act looked a bit worse for the wear.  But the shirt itself if in tact and glorious.  Is my first Swiftly piece and it's wonderful.

1513,"I was thinking about this as someone myself who is pretty self-conscious about how I look in pictures and wanted to pass a word of encouragement along to everybody.

I know that not everyone will relate to this and maybe your confidence is ironclad, but ever since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old and realized that other girls wore size 6/7 when I was in an 8/10, I‚Äôve been very harsh on my own body. I know that I am not even close to the only person who deals with that and so I wanted to just offer this thought. When you get your new clothes and you feel you look amazing, take a minute before you post any picture to look at yourself and be grateful for the body that you have, the things that it can do, and the journey that you‚Äôre on every day.  I think as women especially (even though I know that there are many men on the sub) we are fed all sorts of stuff about how our bodies should look and it can be hard to turn off all of those messages when they are ingrained so deeply in our psyches.

So if you post a fit pic and you don‚Äôt get as many likes as someone else or you might even have someone sending you a mean message as a DM, remember that your worth is not determined by how you look, or even how fit you are. Be grateful for where you‚Äôre at because every person is on a journey spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically (and note that physically is last in line for a reason: it matters but not as much as the other ones).  On a practical level, it is not at all a lie that pictures add 10 pounds.  I‚Äôm dead serious about this.  Don‚Äôt try to get fit just for pictures, which is tempting for this day and age when people share every moment on social media.  I think I look great in person and then as soon as I see a picture of myself I am in a downward spiral for days.  Someone recently made a comment about how they felt it was not authentic when some people make different angles and things like that because they thought it didn‚Äôt show how some thing actually fits on someone‚Äôs body. But sometimes actually your body looks a lot closer to what it really is in real life at a certain angle because the way that lenses are made and particularly those on your phones they don‚Äôt always show the true image of what‚Äôs in front of them!!  I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen a picture of someone and thought that It looks different in real life. This is why you see celebrities going from a size 4 or six as the ideal weight down to zero or two, because they are sizes that you can photograph well at any angle. That is again nothing against those sizes at all you are super blessed if that‚Äôs the case but it is just to say that we have so much pressure put on ourselves and it‚Äôs really amazing what your body can do beyond just being an ornament of beauty.  

I‚Äôd also like to thank the r/xxfitness sub for helping me to realize that sometimes your ideal weight or your health is 5 or 10 pounds heavier than your goal weight, and sometimes someone who looks really fit is dealing with very unhealthy structures of thinking about things which is it to discredit them but it‚Äôs to say that you only need to pay attention to yourself and stay in your own lane.  When you drive and look around too much to cars in the other lane, you crash.  Don‚Äôt do that to yourself by comparing yourself to others.  Just keep going on your journey and you‚Äôll be much happier.

You may be working out the best that you can, eating the best way that you can, watching everything that you do and living a healthy lifestyle, but remember that healthy for you looks different for healthy for other people. It‚Äôs possible that you may not have an hourglass figure and no matter how hard you work or it‚Äôs possible that in order to get an hourglass figure you actually have to be unhealthy. This is not at all to knock people with amazing bodies because they are blessed and we always appreciate it!  It is just to say if you‚Äôre someone like me who struggles with body image and you feel a little bit deflated when your fit pic doesn‚Äôt go over very well, you‚Äôre only showing a tiny facet of who you are because while fitness and health are important, they haven‚Äôt even begun to scratch the surface to who you are.

I've bought a few pieces over the years and usually I need to try on a few before finding what fit right, especially since Lulu runs smaller and it seems to vary a lot.

Well, everything I bought fits great, from Unleash Strength bras to See the Horizon tank (glad I bought a large!). Without all the fit examples I would have sized up and down on some things and it wouldn't have fit well.

1611,"Disclaimer - I am slightly buzzed rn, so keep that in mind while reading üôÉ

This feels so ridiculous to say - because yes, it's just clothing. But I legitimately look forward to Thursday SPECIFICALLY because of this sub. Since covid first began, and quarantine started, I have been dealing with heavy depression/anxiety. My husband was stuck in deployment (covid kept him from returning) and had no return date scheduled. The gym had always been my outlet and I could no longer go. My kids were going absolutely insane because they missed their friends/teachers. It was a hellish shit show. I literally wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 

I have always loved LLL but had no one to share my excitement with and didn't realize this group existed until mid-quarantine... I was so damn excited. 

Mentally, I'm much better now - but Thursday mornings QUICKLY became the day I could look forward to, looking at and sharing hauls with all of you guys. Just genuinely being excited for everyone getting things they had been legitimately looking forward to. I ultimately dedicated that one day to investing in myself, buying a few things  that would make me feel good and hopefully motivate me to maintain the healthy lifestyle I had worked so hard to achieve. Zero regrets. 

Anyway. This post is random, and slightly pointless, but the support and kindness y'all have for one another just truly makes me happy, and honestly really helped me through a very shitty time in my life. So, thank you guys for being amazing.",2020-09-23 21:33:13,43,Thursdays are my absolute favorite day of the week.,0.96,329,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/iynk4a/thursdays_are_my_absolute_favorite_day_of_the_week/
1612,"Posting this from a burner and this may be pretty long but I think it's ridiculous how toxic being an avid fan of lulu has become. I love their brand and I know all of us do, but we should not have to go to the lengths that we do to get our hands on some gear. People wake up in the middle of the night to check the website for restocks and buy on the spot because there is a sense of urgency that has ingrained in all of us. I read the other day that a mom puts her phone on vibrate to not wake her partner and baby to check the site for restocks. We should not have to do that at all and especially a mom with a baby should be SLEEPING!! If we don't buy it NOW, then we may never get it because it will go out of stock or will get bought by resellers. So, people buy hundreds of dollars worth of clothes on the spot because of that fear. They also do not give any of their customers the right amount of information, so people will camp out on their website all day because they don't want to miss an upload. They say theres a sale, but do not say when, so people are forced to be glued on their computer all day instead of doing something more productive. It's also unfair to those who have work and cannot be glued to their computers because every time they will miss out on something they might've really wanted. For example, they could say there will be a new drop every day at 6pm, then I would know I can get all of my other responsibilities over with before 6pm and then be able to catch the sale at the right time without feeling stressed about that uncertainty. It's impossible to focus when you don't know WHEN. I have spent hundreds these couple months because I've bought things instantly without being rational, and they are things I really didn't need but I felt I had to buy them.  For being a brand that has some of the priciest gear, the least they could do is have some transparency with their customers who are willing to spend that much. Most brands offer information on when a certain item will be restocked but they keep everyone on their computers at all hours of the night instead because they know we will buy it no questions asked due to the culture they've created.  Its almost like the colors and styles that the majority of people actually want are restocked the least so they WILL go out of stock thus causing people to wake up for a restock. For a company that stresses health, this is not healthy in the slightest for anyone. I don't even want to get started about what a shit show this cancellation nonsense has been. You also would think that a big company like this would have it together and figure out a better way to operate because there really is no excuse.

1681,"This is a throwaway account - letting you all know that the number of nasty messages and downvotes I receive after posting a fit pic (as a woman of color) has made me feel incredibly unsafe on this sub. I've been thinking about this for a few weeks after posting  for the first time a few weeks ago. I notice people who post after me but are not people of color end up with 15x as many upvotes for what is essentially the same picture. I no longer feel safe or welcome on this sub and will only be a lurker from now on and no longer part of the community. This is so disappointing but given the larger climate of the US/World, and the brand that lululemon has tried to cultivate, I am not surprised. 

Edit - 

I truly appreciate everyone's responses and I will not be returning to this username/sub but as an update, here is what we are dealing with over here. This is the type of thing (not even the worst of what I have seen on my real username) that I am talking about.

1686,"Hey guys, it‚Äôs me again from the GEC. I‚Äôve been reading a lot of posts on here, as well as having a lot of conversations with guests, about people being angry with everything that we‚Äôre doing right now. 
Yes, some returns are taking longer than usual.
Yes, some orders are being cancelled. 
Yes, our queue is stupid long.
But please understand that we are trying our best to keep everybody safe. I don‚Äôt mean to sound mean or unthoughtful, but there are people across the globe right now dealing with lost jobs, sickness, death - so your lululemon pants can wait a few more extra days and so can your refund (let‚Äôs be honest, you are not broke if you are buying lululemon so your life doesn‚Äôt depend on that refund to arrive right then and there). 
This information isn‚Äôt news to you, this flu craziness is constantly being reminded to you all day every day. And I know that me asking you to be patient still won‚Äôt bring you peace of mind on your order or return, so let me explain a bit about the logistics of what‚Äôs going on right now. 
(This next portion is for the US guests out there)
Our West Coast (WC) warehouse was closed for a few weeks due to the Washington state wide lock down. Returns were being held by FedEx and there were no outgoing orders or anything happening in the warehouse since everybody was at home. During this time period, our East Coast (EC) (and smaller) warehouse took over ALL outgoing orders for the entire US. As you can imagine, this was overwhelming and created delays (especially since Ohio had also advised all non-essential workers to stay home). On April 6th our WC warehouse ‚Äúreopened‚Äù but only to process all returns, as the WC warehouse is the warehouse that processed returns for the US( not the EC). Since then, our EC warehouse is still doing ALL outgoing orders for the US and some orders are being cancelled, or simply delayed. Cancellations and delays are due to the overwhelming amount of orders that are being dealt with by a low number of staff, as well as low inventory since we are used to also having the WC stock. 
So in the end, here is some advice from somebody who is asking you to please be more understanding:
- please be kind to everyone, we‚Äôre all just trying
- everywhere has low staff (even if nobody has been laid off) 
- things are delayed and will take longer than usual
- PLEASE stop contacting us with questions that could seriously be easily answered on your own or could at least wait until things calm down, all it‚Äôs doing is making the queue longer for those who have more urgent matters (yes I know, how do you measure ‚Äúurgency‚Äù... well your question about whether something can be hemmed is a tad less urgent than somebody who‚Äôs package said was delivered but isn‚Äôt actually there)
- If we are telling you certain information through any means (email, chat, etc), please trust that that‚Äôs all the current info that we have and that we‚Äôre not deliberately holding things from you (know that we‚Äôre all just confused and bamboozled as you are)
- if your order has been cancelled, please just place a new order - any charges that you may see from that cancelled order is simply a pre-authorization charge that will drop since we never ever charge you for something that hasn‚Äôt shipped (yes, we‚Äôve checked. You haven‚Äôt been charged. The charge will drop)
- or if you can just hold off on placing orders altogether, than that‚Äôs great too (yes, I know that it‚Äôs incredibly tempting to buy)
- your return package is not lost (yes, we‚Äôve checked) it‚Äôs simply delayed and is being processed - reach out to us ONLY if your returns package‚Äôs tracking has said ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to our warehouse and it has been more than 7 business days (yes, BUSINESS days) which we will then deal with - but only then! 

For all of my fellow Canadians, we‚Äôre a bit more lucky. Everything is still opened (just a bit delayed) and is staying that way for now. 

Everybody please just do your part and STAY HOME so we can all get through this together and quickly and safely and healthily (that‚Äôs a word?)

1724,"I‚Äôve been really eager for July 9th and thinking about all the items I‚Äôd like to buy to round out my collection. 

But then I got thinking and realised my collection is rounded out. I can‚Äôt think of anything I need to make it complete, though if I see something in front of me I‚Äôll definitely decide that I ‚Äòneed‚Äô it and will rush to buy it. I‚Äôll be exhilarated if it ships and sad if it doesn‚Äôt. Neither feeling will last long. And the cycle will just restart with the next drop, sale, or fit pic. 

I have items that I‚Äôve never worn, or have only worn once. When I reach into my closet, I always grab the same stuff, the stuff that makes me feel confident, the colours that make me feel happy, and the styles that are comfortable. 

Just a few months ago, I didn‚Äôt have enough of that everyday-I-reach-for-it stuff, and it made sense to build my collection, but now it‚Äôs just become greed. I can afford it. I enjoy it. I wear the stuff I buy or I give it away. But I‚Äôm being controlled by it, which is kinda nuts. 

If I took a softer stance, like I‚Äôll only buy something if it really grabs me, I‚Äôd end up buying a bunch of stuff because I‚Äôll always find something that grabs my attention. The scarcity mindset that Lululemon encourages means that I‚Äôll feel an urgency to purchase, a rush of adrenaline, and then a let down that ensures I buy more. I mean, I love their pieces, but their marketing is genius. 

Anyway, all of that to say that I‚Äôve made a conscious decision to refrain from participating in the July 9th sale, but I‚Äôm still really excited to see everyone‚Äôs hauls and fit pics. I wanted to post here in writing for a bit of accountability, because the number of times I‚Äôve said I‚Äôm going to limit my Lulu spending is just ludicrous. I need to be called out if I go back on my word and start posting a bunch of fit pics of delicious new items.

1730,"I've noticed quite a few of us have ordered and received Lululemon cloth masks. I am disappointed to say the least. My biggest concern has been that the buyers have noticed it is only single layered. From the images I've seen, there appears to be no sleeve or pocket for filters. While some have commented on it's ""thickness"", a single layer is still a single layer. This concerns me because it gives buyers a false sense of protection.

Cloth and clothing materials aren't made like medical PPE materials so alone, they do not filter smaller particles - ""filter"" being the key word here. Multiple layers are recommended for filtering out potentially harmful particles not just from the wearer but also from anyone they may come in close contact with as particles can still linger in the air.

I know a lot of us enjoy the look and colours of LLL designs but please remember, SAFETY FIRST. I'm not saying throw away your LLL masks - Double up. Triple, even. Multiple layers are key for non-medical PPE.

If you have trouble breathing, consider using disposables masks (if you can get your hands on them) and face shields.

STAY SAFE!

&#x200B;

UPDATE (16/12/20)

I've decided to keep comments open despite a lot of pushback on any criticism from those concerned about this mask being only a single layer. It's important people voice their concerns even if they are petty or incorrect.

\- This mask should not be treated as an exception to the layer(s) recommendation. Discussion or no discussion, research or no research, the LLL masks is made from LLL's Ultralu material - the same used in their breathable tights - until someone puts this under a microscope, we will not know how tightly woven the material is. Without an additional non-woven polypropylene (the same material used in disposable pleated masks) layer, it's effectiveness can be questioned and without an additional layer, its effectiveness can be assumed not to be any better than wearing your LLL tights over your face. This is why asking for an additional layer is important - additional layers are another barrier/filter. Fit is another important factor to containing potentially harmful particles from escaping. Despite its contoured design, the LLL mask does not feature an adjustable nose bridge and comes in one standard size. Take into account before purchasing that this mask is not a one-fits-all type.

\- CLOTH MASKS ARE NOT REGULATED. To suggest a cloth mask is better because it was made in a factory by lower income labour is somehow better is naive and a tad reckless. Use common sense when entering situations where social distancing is not possible. Please for everyone's safety - double up when you wear this mask or any other single layer cloth mask. Ask yourself, if going into the gym is really necessary. Treat yourself as if you are asymptomatic.

\- ANY MASK IS BETTER THAN NO MASK.

\- I'm disappointed at a few less than delightful responses and the lax attitude towards health and safety with this pandemic. The excuses are disheartening and some have taken this post as a personal attack. I urge those that feel attacked to take a breath and look at the bigger picture - especially those in North America where the pandemic has taken well over a quarter million lives. This isn't about you... it's about everyone around you.

1752,"I know there have been some passionate debates out the effectiveness of the single layer masks Lululemon has been producing but I wanted to post about a study that was just released. Yes, this is just one study. But it also contradicts a lot of very passionate posts.

https://news.unchealthcare.org/2020/12/research-ranks-various-mask-protection-modifications-against-covid-19/

Essentially, broken down by mask type and its % effective of protecting against COVID sized particles it says:

Single Layer Woven Nylon/Polyester masks with ties (closest in the study to the Lululemon mask) - 39.7% effective /
3 Layer Woven Cotton mask with earloops (supposedly the holy grail touted on here many times /sarcasm) - 26.5% effective

Now, I'm not claiming that the Lululemon mask is the best one out there, clearly it isn't, but it's also demonstrably better than a 3 layer cotton mask.

Yes, the CDC recommends 3 layers, but that is based on the average home user making them from thinner rather porous fabrics, not thicker tightly woven fabrics.

I'm not posting this to slam down the 3 layer proponents. I'm doing this in the effort of informed discussion. I'm also posting this as someone who exclusively wears Under Armour and Adidas (w/ filter) masks. As well, as I said earlier this is only one study, but it offers an interesting perspective.

My hope is that any discussion of masks here can be humanized again, rather than vilifying anyone who even remotely thinks about disagreeing with the 3 layers or death montra that seems to be so overbearing here.

Edit 12hr after original post:

I just want to say thank you for all of the very well put responses on here. I might be a little biased, but I think there is a lot more useful information and opinions put forth here than in many other threads. This was the main goal of posting this. There are still a lot of respectful critical thinkers here and that is good to see.

I would encourage you to read through all the comments, both agreeing and disagreeing with the above. There are a lot of thought provoking threads here that I hope a lot of you take to heart, not just on the mask but in reviewing information in general life too. Not everything is as it is presented, don't be afraid to dig deeper into something you don't understand. Don't be afraid to say you disagree, but do it respectfully. To quote my Grade 8 English teacher, ""You're opinion is worthless, unless you can back it up"". While blunt, it's a motto I've carried with me ever since. I might disagree with you, but I will listen and respond if you can back up your arguments. Who knows, you might even change my mind. How's that for a shocking idea? üòù

The moderator said something along the lines of that we are so lucky to have the privilege of being able to shop online while the people at fed ex, Usps, ups, Canada post are literally risking their lives to deliver our goods.


I couldn‚Äôt agree more.


I see so many complaints about shipping.  It is sooooooo crazy entitled and, quite frankly, tone deaf to complain about shipping during these times.  Period.  On anything.  Well, and any time, really because this is free shipping on athletic clothes. And right now because we‚Äôre in a pandemic.  Who cares if you‚Äôve been waiting 2 extra weeks for a pair of leggings.  Even if you were given a window that it would arrive. There are people dying.  Even if you ‚Äúneed‚Äù it by Christmas for a gift for someone.  You don‚Äôt really.  


I appreciate all the unsung workers that are working their asses off during these time so people can have their goods.  Obviously the medical workers who are risking their lives in a really obvious way every single day but also the Delivery workers.  Grocery workers. Retail workers. People who work behind the scenes so we can get everything we need or want.  And are working in horrible risky environments as well.

1913,"Do you always feel like your size is the most sold out on the site? That you have the fewest options? Like all of us, I always get whiny about how the good stuff is *always* sold out in *my* size (I‚Äôm a size 6). Well, I got a little curious and decided to do a bit of research. What actually IS the dreaded ‚Äúleast available size,‚Äù and how big is the discrepancy?

I went about this in a methodical way. At first, I thought about taking the total count of clothing options on the site and just filtering by size to see what‚Äôs available. But alas, that doesn‚Äôt show you what‚Äôs available by color. For example, if the size 0 25‚Äù Aligns were only in stock in Saddle Brown (lol), they would still show up as in stock overall. So I changed methods.

In economics, inflation is measured by a ‚ÄúConsumer Price Index,‚Äù which is basically a list of common things consumers buy (a Big Mac, a home computer, etc.), measured against itself year after year. I created a ‚ÄúLululemon Stock Index‚Äù consisting of eight commonly purchased Lululemon items. From there, I evaluated how many color options were available in each size. I didn‚Äôt include sale colors.

My list contains:

-	1 pair of running shorts (Regular Hotty Hot II, 2.5‚Äù)
-	2 pairs of leggings (Align II and Full-On Luxtreme Wunder Unders, both 25‚Äù)
-	2 sports bras (Energy and Free To Be Serene)
-	2 tops (Scuplt Tank & Cool Racerback Nulu)
-	1 jacket (Define, in Luon)

In order to make the list, an item had to be:

1.	Available in all sizes carried by Lulu (0-14, or 2-14 in bras)
2.	Available in a plethora of color options (theoretically, anyway)
3.	A ‚ÄúLululemon staple,‚Äù or something that has been around for years and is highly popular. This eliminated the possibility of stock in an item only being low because it‚Äôs a hot new thing people are dying to get their hands on.

Additionally, I did this analysis on a Friday afternoon, not an upload day (again, theoretically). I know stuff pops back into stock from time to time, but I figure across eight items and over 100 colors, we‚Äôd see some pretty convincing trends. Of course, this is one snapshot of the site on one day. I may return to monitor it somewhat and see if these trends stay over time.

As a bonus, I also included the entire ‚ÄúWe Made Too Much‚Äù section as a separate category. I‚Äôm always curious what sizes end up in there.

Anyway, the results are IN. Without further ado, across every non-sale color of our eight Lululemon staple items and found that the LEAST IN-STOCK SIZE IS...(drumroll please)...

SIZE 14. 

A whopping 72.3% of color options are unavailable to Size 14s for these items. That being said, this is Lululemon‚Äôs newest size, so it‚Äôs disappointing but not surprising. Size 14 was followed by size 0, which is on the far other side of the spectrum, again, making some sense. From there, it gets interesting.

The full results:

-	Size 14 - 27.7% of color options are available
-	Size 0 - 45.7%
-	Sizes 2 & 6 - 57.4%
-	Size 4 - 62.8%
-	Size 8 - 72.3%
-	Size 12 - 77.7%
-	Size 10 - 80.9%

Anyway, turns out my whiny Size 6 butt was kind of justified! Sizes 2 and 6 are FAR less likely to be in stock (in these items) than others. Size 10 is the most well-stocked size, with 12 close behind.

What about WMTM? 

In this case, I just looked at number of options available, even if they were limited edition or hella ugly. Results:

-	Size 14 - 3.1% of WMTM items are available
-	Size 0 - 18.4%
-	Size 12 - 32.8%
-	Size 6 - 41.8%
-	Size 8 - 42.2%
-	Size 2 - 42.6%
-	Size 4 - 44.9%
-	Size 10 - 46.9%

So there we have it! If you love your Lulu options, you‚Äôre gonna want to be a size 10. Sizes 0 and 14 get absolutely screwed. In the middle, sizes 4 and 8 get a pretty good deal, while 6 is a bit worse off and 2 is as well. Size 12 has it good in regular-priced items, not so lucky when it comes to sale.

1931,"I wanted to put this out there because of the recent discussion about the quality promise/swapping out of items. I feel like whenever someone gives an answer about the QP, they get downvoted and told they're wrong. Well, they're not wrong, because it happened. And it could happen for you too, you've just probably never tried! The stores don't suffer any losses besides inventory.

As my name implies, I‚Äôm a Key Leader at a large store that is very lax when it comes to quality promises. But, we have our limits. So, here‚Äôs a few things I have swapped, and a few that I have rejected. I'll also include a couple things I have personally swapped while not working for the company. Hopefully this gives some of y‚Äôall some perspective and maybe some confidence. You are spending a lot of money and you deserve a quality product. 

Again, these are from MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. Most of the time educators are told to use their best judgment. Every store is different, but I encourage you to just try. Some of these have lengthy descriptions, some of them are more straightforward.

First and foremost, if an item can be repaired that is what I will make happen. A tiny hole in the seam does not justify a swap. Also, please wash your stuff before you bring it in. That shouldn't even need to be said, but please. Good God, please. I'll also add, don't ruin it for the rest of us. Don't take advantage of the system or the employees. 

Another tip: Call ahead! Make sure a trip won't be wasted. BUT if you're going to call a store beforehand to ask about a swap and they say yes they'll swap it, go to THAT STORE. Don't come to me and say ""well \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ told me that I could"". That is not helpful. For all I know you could've described the item differently, or you're just straight up lying. 

**List of Approved (by me) Swaps**:

\-Pilling Aligns: I know this is what most of y'all came here for so I'll put it first. Aligns pill, we know this. But there's a difference between aligns pilling in the inner thigh because of legs rubbing together and aligns pilling EVERYWHERE because you are doing floor workouts in them and washing/drying them with your jeans and sweatshirts. And we can tell the difference basically right away. If you bring in a pair of absolutely battered aligns, I'm going to look at your guest profile to see if you have a history of swapping these out. If you don't, I will kindly remind you how to properly wash the pants and swap them out. If the aligns look great but the inner thighs are pilled and torn, I'll swap them out right away. 

\-Everywhere Belt Bag: I‚Äôve swapped these for a myriad of reasons, primarily the zipper. Lululemon is notorious for its shitty zippers. Sometimes the fabric gets a random hole in it, which obviously shouldn't happen. In most cases the bag looks pretty new and I know it‚Äôs on us. Since we are almost always out of Belt Bags, I either put the balance on a gift card or order one for them in the store using that gift card.

\-Scubas/Defines/misc zip jackets: again, those damn zippers. Not everything needs to be reversible! If it's a Scuba or a Define that's an easy swap, but if it's an older style we will replace it with something we deem comparable. In this case, I don't really pay attention to how old the product looks because I have coats and jackets from other brands that are 10+ years old and the zippers still work perfectly. It's those fucking zippers. 

Ok I'm done talking about zippers now.

\-Mesh: there was an inch long rip in the mesh of the Power Y shelf bra. I've never seen that before, and I've never experienced it with my Power Ys. That's an older style, so I swapped it for an ETS tank. On some pieces the mesh isn't sewn in but is held to the fabric with glue. If the mesh is coming apart from the fabric, that's not something we can fix. Since a majority of stuff with mesh is made for sweaty workouts, it should hold up. I've swapped a pair of pants with the mesh coming apart from the fabric before with no issues.

\-Broken belt loops: this will happen on ABC/Commission pants. Belt loops are made for belts, so using a belt shouldn't break them. Those are probably one of the most high quality products LLL makes and can easily last 5+ years, so a broken belt loop is on us.

\-Fabric imperfections/snags: I had a woman bring in a pair of basically brand new ATRP pants (with the receipt, bless her heart) that had these little threads coming loose all over. They made these thin white lines all over the legs. I don't consider that to be user error. Also, a snag in the fabric of a very fresh pair of WUs I consider to be a defect. A snag can happen by just brushing past a piece of furniture wrong. It has never happened to me personally, but it has happened with cheaper activewear. 

\-Pocket holes: examples of pieces include Surge joggers, men's shorts, and Keep Moving pants. Holes in the **f****abric** of the pockets I consider to be a defect. Holes in the seams can be repaired. 

\-See through pants: obviously the company has been known to have issues with this. So yeah. I successfully swapped a pair of Train Times crops that were see through. A girl in my workout class told me which was...mortifying.

**List of Denied (by me) Swaps**:

\-Pilling aligns: Just to reiterate, you need to take care of your aligns. I have thick thighs and wear aligns just as much as anyone else, and the only place they pill is the inner thigh and occasionally the butt seams. Wash them inside out, with other activewear only, cold water, no softener, hang dry. That horrible, can't-wear-anymore pilling comes from misuse and not washing correctly.

\-Fabric holes: so this is where your results are gonna be the most varied. If you come into the store saying ""I fell in these and the knee ripped"", that's not a product flaw. I'm sorry you fell, but these are leggings not work pants. However, I have had success swapping out pants with a hole in the butt. It really depends. If the hole just appeared, bring them in and explain the situation. Be honest.

\-Flaws in OLD OLD OLD styles: these clothes don't have a lifetime guarantee. If your reversible low rise Luon WUs covered in pet hair and pills have seams unravelling, it's time to retire them and buy a new pair. I know you've either had them since 2010, they're hand me downs or you bought them off Poshmark. 

Hopefully this helps a little! My simplest tips would be to be honest, be KIND, and just try! The worst that could happen is they say no.",2020-10-31 15:16:21,48,Quality Promise: A Keyleader's Perspective,0.97,257,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/jlo9w7/quality_promise_a_keyleaders_perspective/

1933,"Title says it all.  It hit me yesterday - what am I doing?  Yes, I am lucky that I am secure with my jobs right now, but who knows what will happen in the future? ANYTHING can happen.  The last thing I should be doing is spending $100-500 per week on workout clothing.

 I looked at all my stuff, I do not need more... In fact, getting more is almost useless since I will not have any time to wear it!!! 

My return pile has increased.  I put aside items that don't suit me very well, and also some items which I do not need.  I calculated how much I will get back, about $670 including tax.  That is a lot of money.  

I kept reminding myself that I am moving at the end of the summer and will need to buy some new furniture, a new car, etc.  I have money saved, but I should have more.  

Anyways, not sure why I typed this out.  I guess it was kind of a vent, but I also hope it helps some of you out who may be in the same boat.  It sometimes helps to hear it from someone else that you gotta stop what you're doing!  I'm lucky that I don't really have an addictive personality, but I tend to get caught up in the hype of stuff (think limited makeup or sneaker releases, and new releases at Lululemon).  This quarantine doesn't help either.  I realize days after I receive my order that the temporary high has fizzled out and I have no more interest in some items I've bought... And some items I only got because other people raved about them.  I gotta admit, the new align fabric bra and long sleeve top are calling to me, but I do not need them.

1981,Hi ladies (and some men). Fit pics are a fun and popular part of this great sub but I have been thinking lately about safety with our pics. I have gotten an annoying DM after posting one the other day and it got me thinking that they are probably plenty of creepers trolling this sub just to look at pics of women in leggings. I wanted to suggest or put forth the idea of hiding faces in the pics for safety. People can save the pics and if there is too much identifying info as well it could pose a safety issue.

2020,"So I purchased a pair of aligns off of Poshmark. I knew it was a risky purchase. I shop on Poshmark frequently, and I‚Äôd found one of my ISOs in my preferred length at a decent price. Not a steal, not outrageous $$, just a good enough price for a pair of aligns in great condition, as described. The seller‚Äôs pictures were vague, but they didn‚Äôt have many listings and I thought it might just be a new seller who‚Äôs not great at selling yet. I‚Äôve gotten some gems through that kind of listing in the past, so I rolled the dice. 

The package came today and... yeah. Not great condition. They‚Äôve clearly been through several rounds in the dryer. Significant pilling, several patches of snags in the fabric. The size and length are accurate, but the condition is more truthfully described as fair than great. As in, they‚Äôll work, but aesthetically they‚Äôre not what a reasonable person would expect great condition pants to look like. 

I decided to keep the pants because I‚Äôm tired of searching for the pattern, and I have the knowledge and skill to fix them. They won‚Äôt look like new, but I can repair them to the point where they‚Äôre not embarrassing to wear. 

And then I left a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è review and a detailed description of what was wrong with the pants. And now I‚Äôm feeling guilty. I don‚Äôt want to trash a seller, but I feel like leaving a falsely positive review, or no review at all, doesn‚Äôt help anyone. The seller never knows that their listing was not acceptable, and future buyers don‚Äôt know that they really need to ask for clarifying photos with this seller. 

What do you all think? Should I have just tried to return the pants rather than leave a negative review? And what does ‚Äúgreat condition‚Äù mean to you? Are my expectations unrealistic?",2021-03-09 13:29:27,27,I just left a negative Poshmark review and I‚Äôm feeling guilty but also... yikes.,0.81,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/m1cu44/i_just_left_a_negative_poshmark_review_and_im/

Per usual, there was not much if you were below a size 8, but there were some good finds this week. They do have an almost full size run of the Stronger as One bra in Incognito Camo Multi Grey, but I didn't get it because I didn't like the fit of it on me (all my back fat went through that hole in the back and it looked REAL weird even though it fit perfect everywhere else üò©).

They had a lot of outerwear, some dresses, some pants, and the usual racks of leggings and bras/tanks. They did not have any special pricing on anything, except for accessories. For things like single pack underwear and scrunchies, there was a 3 for $15 deal, I think.

2462,"Just wanted to talk to you guys :) 
I had my last shift at lulu on Sunday 

I‚Äôd been with the company for 5.5 years! 
Met so many of my best friends and it was such a positive influence on my life 

The reason why I left was because for the past 2.5 years I‚Äôd been working fulltime in my career and only worked at the store on weekends
It‚Äôs time for me to enjoy the fruits of my labor and spend time with my husband and cat on my days off! 

Most of my fellow educators were either pursuing higher education or working towards a specific goal of theirs so I never felt like I was surrounded by ‚Äúidiots who worked retail‚Äù which is some feedback guests have had for us in the past LOL 

The majority of us either are currently pursuing a bachelors, a masters, studying for law school, studying for medical school, or any other ambitious goal. We absolutely love being at work surrounded by like-minded people who strive every single day to be better than our yesterday. 

Frankly my disposable income in the past two years has increased so much that I have more clothes with tags in my closet than I do clothes I can wear especially since the majority of my clothes I can only wear while I‚Äôm at Lulu or at home haha 

My career goals are to return to Lulu at the corporate level so I will not be gone for long but for my wallet sake and my FedEx driver sake it is time for me to go.. 

I have enjoyed my time on the sub Reddit seeing all of you people slay in your fit pics, answering questions, and Losing sleep over restocks and drops

Thank you for making my time here enjoyable I will now have to dip because I cannot purchase anything at full price even though I have sweat collective due to me being a personal trainer on weekday nights LOL 

Thank you all again!! 
And goodbye educator flair you lent me so much credibility...

I do still have a pair of old size 12 Groove pants in luon that I've been wearing in the WFH world. They're a little snug, but they fit. Most of my clothes now are 16-18... 1X/2X depending on brands.

I received a lulu gift certificate for Christmas from my boss and while there is some stuff out there, there aren't a ton of options, BUT Groove pants are back, so I was thinking about getting a fresh pair to last me until I start getting AARP mailings.

ANYWAYS--  
Can anyone give sizing tips and recommendations beyond ""look at the size chart""?   
Thoughts on fabric? Is the old luon still available? What's closest to it?

2553,"This is my first post on this group. As a powerlifter, having high performance leggings/tights are a must to withstand long, grueling workouts. I have used multiple brands over the past few years with one issue being that the waistband would slide down on the men tights from these brands. On a recent trip to a Lululemon store in Milwaukee, the employee Kristen and I had a excellent conversation about powerlifting and leg day workouts. After explaining the issue I was having, she recommended that I try on the women's Swift Speed High Rise Tight. I laughed a little to myself, but Kristen said you be surprised, let me know what you think. After trying them, I was blown away. They fit amazing, do not slide, fair amount of compression, and powerlifting proof. Over a 2 hour powerlifting workout, I subjected them to heavy squats, leg presses, hamstring curls, and they performed extremely well. The material can handle thick neoprene knee sleeves for, thus showing their durability. Overall, even though I own 2 pairs of Men's surge light tights, the Swift Speed High Rise however are in a league all their own. You will not be disappointed.

I have the FTBW high neck and i love how it looks but it's hard to put on because of that extra fabric. So im worried that if theres also a long line its gonna be even harder to put on. Also not to mention that I cant wear it under certain shirts that have a lower neckline cuz then it just looks weird.

With the FTBW long line, I never tried it before but is there a thick band at the bottom where the long line is? or is it just a piece of fabric? cuz im worried it would be uncomfortable if theres a thick band around my ribcage.

And personally I think high necks look more flattering on me since im pretty flat chested, whereas with the regular neck lines theres kind of a gapping space between the bra and my chest. But i hate having to struggle to put on the high neck versions, so its hard to decided lol.

2701,"The pandemic took a big hit on my mental health. After two postponed weddings, job uncertainties, and lots of emotional eating I found myself at my heaviest weight, hating my body and finding comfort in ‚Äúloose & comfy‚Äù clothing. 

I have know about lululemon for years, but never though I was the right ‚Äúsize‚Äù for it. After joining Reddit and finding this community, I realized that‚Äôs I‚Äôve been missing out. I did my research, bough my first pair of leggings and for the first time in many many months, I felt beautiful. I started then experimenting with tops, sport bras, and becoming more of an active reader on this community and wow, y‚Äôall motivate me so much!!! 

As for now, everything I have fits, (a tad tight here and there, and some rolls I want to get rid of) but I‚Äôm motivated to see progress in clothes that already make me feel pretty. I am starting to work out consistently (I love weight training and I‚Äôm finding ways to weight train at home because gyms by me aren‚Äôt open) and I am also doing what I can to practice yoga and meditation to connect with myself and ‚Äúforgive‚Äù myself for how I‚Äôve been treating my body in the past year. 

For anyone on a similar weight loss/self love journey, I‚Äôd love to hear how you keep yourself motivated and accountable every day. Do you follow any particular practices/routine or people on IG/YT who motivate you? What are you favorite at-home strength training workouts to follow? 

I am also trying to look my best for my (fingers crossed) November 21‚Äô wedding so I need to keep pushing myself.

I initially thought of the City Adventurer because I love the shoe compartment, but I read a lot of reviews about quality issues (mainly zippers) which I'm not willing to deal with. How do we feel about the City Adventurer? If you like it, would the Mini also fit a pair of shoes in the bottom compartment, or is it too small? I'm trying to get a bag that's just big enough to hold a water bottle, shoes, and change of clothes. Also, what are thoughts on the New Crew? I've heard good things but it's missing the shoe compartment, which is a bummer (unless it has a shoe compartment idk about, which would be awesome).

If you don't like their backpacks, what are backpacks or small gym bags that you do like?

This bra is pretty heavenly. For the record I don‚Äôt wear wire bras so I am used to the uni boob not pointing at the ceiling look. That said this bra does not separate as the tag claims. Pretty solid uni boob but because the bra is light and not compressive it doesn‚Äôt smoosh you down either. It‚Äôs soooo soft. It‚Äôs like aligns on your boobs. Like aligns, it is not really compressive but still hugs you. I have no issues with shoulder straps slipping or band riding up. The band is very comfortable while not being flimsy. This bra really feels like your wearing nothing yet it holds everything in nicely. 

My only complaint is that they should make the cups like the Like a Cloud bra with the foam layer built in. The crappy inserts are a pain and I have to adjust them every time I put the bra on.
