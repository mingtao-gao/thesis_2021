If I still feel insecure I might just go with the regular 10.5 and use them a little roomier since at least my feet would fit."

I was browsing their site when they released, and just ordered then on instinct.  


There's not a lot of info out there about them apart from the same basic info, probably based on some press release. But the way I read it only 73 pairs were made of the blue set.

So my question to anyone more informed than me would be if the 73 count applies per size or in total. I'm guessing the former but have not been able to find anything about it. 

Next I tracked them down on Stock X and was a bit surprised to find that they trade for well under purchase price. Not that I'm looking to sell, it is more that I would expect a set with such low production numbers to attract higher figures.   
Could it be that the rumoured ""73 pairs"" is not true? Or maybe because it has passed a bit under the radar? Or is it simply down to it not really being very ""wearable"" but more of a gimmick?

All knowledge or thoughts  on the subject would be much appreciated. :)"

100,PUMA Suede only lasting me three months - change in quality?,6,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUMA/comments/l65dvt/puma_suede_only_lasting_me_three_months_change_in/,1,2021-01-27 09:16:56,"Over the last four or five years, I've owned four pairs of PUMA Suede in a row. At any given time, they were my only pair of shoes. Each pair has lasted me somewhere between a year and a year and three months until they started being so worn down that I had to replace them.

My [newest pair](https://imgur.com/a/y04IDO1) only lasted me three months until holes started to appear in the heel area of the sole. Rain water would get into my shoes through the holes and the general walking comfort declined noticeably.

This was my first pair that wasn't all-black; this time they had a white sole. Also, while I usually buy in Europe, this time I bought them in Japan. From an official PUMA store, by the way.

Has PUMA changed something about the design of the sole (more air, less rubber, thinner rubber, different compound) that could account for this? Has anyone else noticed this?

I'm hesitant to buy a new pair now, because I'm not willing to spend another ~90 bucks for shoes that will only last me 3 months. But maybe it was just a one-off?

I've contacted PUMA support and all they had to say (after a three months wait, mind you) was: ""Unfortunately we can't assist you without the receipt and/or the original shoes"".

I thought I read one post where the guy said his SoftFoam inserts that came with the shoe disintegrated after 2 weeks... It's a $60 shoe so while that's pretty cheap, I feel like it shouldn't be doing that? Buuuut I don't have a problem of putting in my own Dr. Scholls inserts.

Also, are black mono color ways actually that popular? I'm surprised to see it sold out everywhere except for sketchy 3rd party sites but lighter colors readily available.

So I wanted to know if the size guide Puma has on their website is basically the length of the insole or is it the outsole? My feet measure around 25.8 cm or 25.9 and judging from that a US size 8 fits me perfectly according to their chart because it's 26 cm but is it actually true to size and are they talking about the inner length of the boot? It would really help if someone here has bought Puma cleats and know if they fit them true to size or if they had to go half up or down. 

I plan on ordering a pair of Future 5.1s but it would be hard for me to return the pair if it's the wrong size so I would rather choose carefully than go through the headache. 

I've had the nemeziz 19.3 cleats but they've grown past their life and these I had in the size US 8.5 but even though Addidas claims they are 25.9 cm long in that size they are still about a cm or half or more of a cm longer. And after breaking in they have quite the room for slippage. Hence I'm looking to buy one with close to perfect length and the rest will just break in with time.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to reply!"

I've had a pair of these Romas for a few years and they're in rough shape now. I believe I got them from Nordstrom Rack. I love the fit and feel--they're textile/canvas so they have a little give--and the regular Romas (leather/suede uppers) feel too narrow on my feet. Do they still make/sell anything similar with material that has some flex to it, preferably not in white? I've found pictures of a black version of these, but honestly I care more for the fit than pattern. Thanks!

I'm a bit desperate here. I had my old Reebok Ventillators at size 9us (42eur). But they are just old and I was looking for some new shoes. 

Really loved the look of the Puma Thunder models but could not find those in stores. So I just blindly ordered new Thunder at the same size as my old Reeboks 9(42). Sadly that was really small and I had to return them. 

Thought maybe all the Pumas are a bit smaller and went to local shop just to try any pair of Puma. And the size was fine on three different models. But all of those were not the ones I wanted! 

So checked again and yeah, sometimes people just say that you should get a half size bigger. And I ordered a new par at 9.5 (42.5). 

Today they arrived, and I really wanted them to fit, but still they are a bit small and now I'll have to also return them. 

I know I'm stubborn and I see no alternative to design of those that I want, so I will order new size 10 (43). 

But before that, just wanted to get some real feedback, if there are any, about the fit of this particular model."

They also offer their assistance (with Puma's customer), giving me the opportunity to call Puma while they continue to hold and invite both parties onto a three-way call, to confirm with Puma: They never relayed a refund to the original payment utilized at Checkout (this is probably the first and most definitive answer I ever received regarding this buffoonery). I call Puma CS and fortunately, reach a genuine representative with some common-core-sense, who almost immediately acknowledges I should have *'...seen the REFUND over a week ago;'* She also (finally) divulges: *'Our credit department had a* *""conflict""* *with Refunds issued on MAY 2nd. Your refund was also, likely affected by the* ***May 2nd Refund Exception*** *... I'd expedite your case* (Refund) *on Monday when* \[the department\] *is back in the office; You should see it by* ***WEDNESDAY, May 15th*** (72-hrs) *AT THE LATEST*\*.'\*
* I called Puma Wednesday morning, **MAY 15th,** to speak to a manager who wouldn't even acknowledge previously stated May 2nd ""Refund Errors"" and only wanted to discuss their Refund Policy (timeline) and New Opportunity: Why not cancel the Full ReFUNDs and accept a Puma Shopping Credit for equal amount? I couldn't use the credit right away since it could take up to 72-hrs for it to appear in my Puma Store account (I'm certain that service manager is now enrolled in a 30-day treatment program). She continued, *'...otherwise it could take up to 30-DAYS, from* ***May 2nd***\*, For the Funds to be Returned...'\* (She for sure confirmed the *'30-days* start *.. from May 2nd'*)
* I called back this morning (Still No Refund) and the representative now says (after fully acknowledging their *'May 2nd Company-wide Refund-Hiccup'*) that, *'...a New Refund was issued* ***May 8th*** *(8 Days ago) and the Refund Should Definitely Be There* *~~TODAY~~* *TOMORROW!'*

F U puma and your Totally Free Returns Hogwash-Snakeoil. I will NEVER patronize your Cesspool Buffoonery Again. How can you almost solely rely on *'...30 days or billing cycle..'* Refund Policy in era of Amazon Prime, or even Electronic Transactions, when absolutely no brand could thrive on such assurances made by dilettantes & Luddites?

Puma customer service 5-2-19 email:

>*Refunds are normally posted to your account within 3-5 business days. Occasionally, it can take up to one full billing cycle, depending on your financial institution’s policy.*

&#x200B;

EDIT: Still No Refund by **Friday** \[**5-17**\] late morning (one day after submitting here); I called Puma customer service again, their new update: *'...Refund was re-sent* ***Thur, May 9th*** (8 days prior) *to Financial Institute, depending on their policy, it could take up to* ***May 22nd*** (2 weeks) *for you to see the funds available...'* I insisted that's Not my bank's policy (based on the 5-11 call to bank). I asked why they told me, just 1 Day earlier: '*...the refund was re-sent May 8th and the funds will be available to me by Friday, 17th (today) At The Very LATEST?'* Puma CS Rep said their Rep misspoke and should not have said that several times during the call. I confirmed with bank, before and after that late morning Puma call: NO Refund.

Within the hour the funds were Finally returned to my account.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**tl;dr**: It took Puma **37 Days** to Refund my purchase, from the time I completed their Return Policy.

Puma insisted unforeseeable Exceptions or Delays, affected by all customers, prevented the merchant from returning the funds to my bank for **24 Days,** After Puma Received the Merchandise."

I got these shoes a few years ago and they were the best ive ever had. They were all white, i got them at the puma outlet like 2 years ago and cant find any trace of them online. Why is it so hard to find a shoe.

My best description:

They were all white with a little bit of gold on the tongue where it said puma also their was a small black puma swoosh on the side and i know there was a little bit of gold somewhere else on it but hardly noticeable. On the sole there was a few concave dots on the sides near the back of the heal. The back of the heal had a loop to pull your shoes on. It had a sort of memory foam inside the shoe extremely comfortable like nothing i ever wore before. 

If i had to make a comparison it looks sort of like the tsugi but not at all the same shoe. 

Someone please help and enlighten me, my mom threw them out and i was keeping them to try and get another pair someday.

I am dying for these. I’m also hoping for a black and white colorway too. 

Regrettably it seems like finishline won’t be carrying them. Even footlocker won’t. 

I’ll have to get them online on Puma’s site it seems. I hope they’re tts

It is noticeably softer to the touch and has a bouncier response. I’d say it is still not the same as Boost but I don’t really care for that sensation of sinking into my shoes constantly. It’s clear that Puma is still interested in perfecting this technology. Don’t know if I’d rely on them as a running trainer but this is the first shoe that’s made me consider moving away from Lunar.

767,Are these Puma Suede fake?,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUMA/comments/5zqoev/are_these_puma_suede_fake/,3,2017-03-16 09:51:13,"[Here is a galary](http://imgur.com/a/jp0G8)  
  Backstory: I overheard someone say ""Yeah Arthur (me) got these too... but his are fake. They are too expensive. I got these in black.""  
  I don't know which shoes they talk about but i know i bought all my other shoes from legit stores so i don't care if other people think they are fake. The most expensive shoes i got are Nike Socfly for 110€ at that time. But i didn't buy the Puma Suedes, they were a gift from my ex so i don't know the origin exactly.  
  I don't really care if they are not original for fashion/money reasons i just think it's weird for someone to gift fake shoes so i'm asking if someone can tell by fact if these are legit.  
  Also i think it's weird that this person said ""they are too expensive""... if i look these up they are 50-70€. If that person meant other shoes, it doesn't matter anymore because i know for sure where i bought them. Thanks for anyone taking time to check these out!"

So I was surfing the net for some Pumas and I've found out something I didn't find a proper answer to, what is the difference between these 2 pairs apart from the price?

Black-white 03 model: https://www.amazon.es/Puma-Classic-Zapatillas-Unisex-Black-White/dp/B004SGJRTC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472060821&sr=8-1&keywords=puma

Black/white model: idk how to find the right link for this model, but if you go to ''color'' and list the model I mentioned (black/white) you will see it.

I recently purchased a set of Red Suede classics, [this pair](http://uk.puma.com/uk/en/pd/suede-classic%2B-trainers/352634.html?dwvar_352634_color=team%20regal%20red-white#start=2)

Looking at the image on the site, I was expecting the suede and laces to be a close match in colour. Upon receiving the shoes however, the suede itself is a little more along the pink/pastel red and is visibly different from the laces. I'm not sure how well you might make this out, but [these are the shoes](https://scontent-ams3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13694607_503140146562082_1923621658_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMzc0NDY0Mjk3MDE0ODA1Mw%3D%3D.2) under a regular household bulb, which doesn't help highlight the issue

I was curious as to whether this is an oversight on their behalf or simply the nature of suede. Additionally, the 'white' on the side is more cream than it is white. I'm not overly fussed, just thinking I could pick up something else closer to the red I had in mind and return these.

Any advice/help is appreciated. I don't often buy shoes but I do love Pumas when I do, so I'm a little disappointed in these :("

A few years ago i saw some Puma's(I'm sure they were Pumas) that were like pieces of cloth layered over the top of each other. Almost like panels in a fence. 

I never got the name of them anyone have any idea what i could possible be taking about.

At any given time, they were my only pair of shoes. Each pair has lasted me somewhere between a year and a year and three months until they started being so worn down that I had to replace them.

My [newest pair](https://imgur.com/a/y04IDO1) only lasted me three months until holes started to appear in the heel area of the sole. Rain water would get into my shoes through the holes and the general walking comfort declined noticeably.

This was my first pair that wasn't all-black; this time they had a white sole. Also, while I usually buy in Europe, this time I bought them in Japan. From an official PUMA store, by the way.

Has PUMA changed something about the design of the sole (more air, less rubber, thinner rubber, different compound) that could account for this? Has anyone else noticed this?

I'm hesitant to buy a new pair now, because I'm not willing to spend another ~90 bucks for shoes that will only last me 3 months. But maybe it was just a one-off?

I've contacted PUMA support and all they had to say (after a three months wait, mind you) was: ""Unfortunately we can't assist you without the receipt and/or the original shoes"".

1232,Packer Shoes x Puma Clyde (Cow Suit Collection),5,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUMA/comments/ldl455/packer_shoes_x_puma_clyde_cow_suit_collection/,2,2021-02-05 19:05:55,"I quite randomly got my hands on a set of the [Walt ""Clyde"" Frazier hommage colab](https://www.sneakerfreaker.com/releases/packer-x-puma-clyde-cow-suits-pack) between Packer shoes and Puma. I was browsing their site when they released, and just ordered then on instinct.  


There's not a lot of info out there about them apart from the same basic info, probably based on some press release. But the way I read it only 73 pairs were made of the blue set.

So my question to anyone more informed than me would be if the 73 count applies per size or in total. I'm guessing the former but have not been able to find anything about it. 

Next I tracked them down on Stock X and was a bit surprised to find that they trade for well under purchase price. Not that I'm looking to sell, it is more that I would expect a set with such low production numbers to attract higher figures.   
Could it be that the rumoured ""73 pairs"" is not true? Or maybe because it has passed a bit under the radar? Or is it simply down to it not really being very ""wearable"" but more of a gimmick?

All knowledge or thoughts  on the subject would be much appreciated. :)"

It's a $60 shoe so while that's pretty cheap, I feel like it shouldn't be doing that? Buuuut I don't have a problem of putting in my own Dr. Scholls inserts.

Also, are black mono color ways actually that popular? I'm surprised to see it sold out everywhere except for sketchy 3rd party sites but lighter colors readily available.

I'm a bit desperate here. I had my old Reebok Ventillators at size 9us (42eur). But they are just old and I was looking for some new shoes. 

Really loved the look of the Puma Thunder models but could not find those in stores. So I just blindly ordered new Thunder at the same size as my old Reeboks 9(42). Sadly that was really small and I had to return them. 

Thought maybe all the Pumas are a bit smaller and went to local shop just to try any pair of Puma. And the size was fine on three different models. But all of those were not the ones I wanted! 

So checked again and yeah, sometimes people just say that you should get a half size bigger. And I ordered a new par at 9.5 (42.5). 

Today they arrived, and I really wanted them to fit, but still they are a bit small and now I'll have to also return them. 

I know I'm stubborn and I see no alternative to design of those that I want, so I will order new size 10 (43). 

But before that, just wanted to get some real feedback, if there are any, about the fit of this particular model."

It’s clear that Puma is still interested in perfecting this technology. Don’t know if I’d rely on them as a running trainer but this is the first shoe that’s made me consider moving away from Lunar.

  Backstory: I overheard someone say ""Yeah Arthur (me) got these too... but his are fake. They are too expensive. I got these in black.""  
  I don't know which shoes they talk about but i know i bought all my other shoes from legit stores so i don't care if other people think they are fake. The most expensive shoes i got are Nike Socfly for 110€ at that time. But i didn't buy the Puma Suedes, they were a gift from my ex so i don't know the origin exactly.  
  I don't really care if they are not original for fashion/money reasons i just think it's weird for someone to gift fake shoes so i'm asking if someone can tell by fact if these are legit.  
  Also i think it's weird that this person said ""they are too expensive""... if i look these up they are 50-70€. If that person meant other shoes, it doesn't matter anymore because i know for sure where i bought them. Thanks for anyone taking time to check these out!"

So I wanted to know if the size guide Puma has on their website is basically the length of the insole or is it the outsole? My feet measure around 25.8 cm or 25.9 and judging from that a US size 8 fits me perfectly according to their chart because it's 26 cm but is it actually true to size and are they talking about the inner length of the boot? It would really help if someone here has bought Puma cleats and know if they fit them true to size or if they had to go half up or down. 

I plan on ordering a pair of Future 5.1s but it would be hard for me to return the pair if it's the wrong size so I would rather choose carefully than go through the headache. 

I've had the nemeziz 19.3 cleats but they've grown past their life and these I had in the size US 8.5 but even though Addidas claims they are 25.9 cm long in that size they are still about a cm or half or more of a cm longer. And after breaking in they have quite the room for slippage. Hence I'm looking to buy one with close to perfect length and the rest will just break in with time.

1569,FYI: Still waiting for REFUNS from last April's PUMA Deal for Extra 40% Off Men's Astro Sala Sneakers [available again w code: MID],2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUMA/comments/bpj1tv/fyi_still_waiting_for_refuns_from_last_aprils/,2,2019-05-16 18:23:50,"I'm S T I L L waiting for my refund for Puma's Astro Sala Sneakers (RE: [Code: APRIL30](https://slickdeals.net/f/12993847-puma-new-season-new-faves-30-with-code-april30-4-87)) placed on **APRIL 7th**.

FYI: Their *Free Shipping Returns* can normally take up to a month & their weekday customer service reps can only relay the same info provided on invoice (albeit, their weekend staffers actually investigate & acknowledge exceptions, i.e. merchant error)

[Great sneakers (Men's Astro Cup in brown)](https://slickdeals.net/?sdtid=13084045&sdfpid=472639&sdpid=127551970&sdfid=9&sdfib=1&lno=1&trd=Great%20sneakers%20Men%20s%20Astro%20Cup%20i&pv=&au=&u2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPUMA-Mens-Astro-Cup-Sneaker%2Fdp%2FB01MSZMWS3), I really wish I could have kept them, but no matter the sock I was wearing the Right shoe was significantly smaller than (10.5) the other shoe.

* I immediately initiated the Return (on the same day they arrived, never wore the shoes outdoors or for more than 15 minutes) **APRIL 10th** \- USPS electronically received the Return the following day.
* The sneakers didn't arrive at the PUMA Warehouse until **APRIL 23rd** (okay, that's understandable, after all it is *Total Free Returns*). PUMA didn't identify my Returned Merchandise until **APRIL 28th** (*""...the warehouse can get quite busy, and delay's occasional do occur...""*).
* Puma Finally authorized the RETURN and Issued a REFUND on Thursday, **MAY 2nd**. After **another week** and still No Refund back in my account, I call customer service AGAIN, they insist I inquire with my financial institute since they, *'...Definitely Issued the Funds there .. Otherwise it should be there by this Saturday...'*
* Puma CS responds to my **May 7th** e-mail asking the obvious (while outlying aforementioned):

>*Refunds are normally posted to your account within 3-5 business days. Occasionally, it can take up to one full billing cycle, depending on your financial institution’s policy.*

* My bank insists, Saturday a.m. **MAY 11th**, Puma never sent a refund for this (April 7th, $26) transaction and if there is a Refund, it's only been initiated, since there is no Transaction, it only exists Internally, with the merchant. They also offer their assistance (with Puma's customer), giving me the opportunity to call Puma while they continue to hold and invite both parties onto a three-way call, to confirm with Puma: They never relayed a refund to the original payment utilized at Checkout (this is probably the first and most definitive answer I ever received regarding this buffoonery). I call Puma CS and fortunately, reach a genuine representative with some common-core-sense, who almost immediately acknowledges I should have *'...seen the REFUND over a week ago;'* She also (finally) divulges: *'Our credit department had a* *""conflict""* *with Refunds issued on MAY 2nd. Your refund was also, likely affected by the* ***May 2nd Refund Exception*** *... I'd expedite your case* (Refund) *on Monday when* \[the department\] *is back in the office; You should see it by* ***WEDNESDAY, May 15th*** (72-hrs) *AT THE LATEST*\*.'\*
* I called Puma Wednesday morning, **MAY 15th,** to speak to a manager who wouldn't even acknowledge previously stated May 2nd ""Refund Errors"" and only wanted to discuss their Refund Policy (timeline) and New Opportunity: Why not cancel the Full ReFUNDs and accept a Puma Shopping Credit for equal amount? I couldn't use the credit right away since it could take up to 72-hrs for it to appear in my Puma Store account (I'm certain that service manager is now enrolled in a 30-day treatment program). She continued, *'...otherwise it could take up to 30-DAYS, from* ***May 2nd***\*, For the Funds to be Returned...'\* (She for sure confirmed the *'30-days* start *.. from May 2nd'*)
* I called back this morning (Still No Refund) and the representative now says (after fully acknowledging their *'May 2nd Company-wide Refund-Hiccup'*) that, *'...a New Refund was issued* ***May 8th*** *(8 Days ago) and the Refund Should Definitely Be There* *~~TODAY~~* *TOMORROW!'*

F U puma and your Totally Free Returns Hogwash-Snakeoil. I will NEVER patronize your Cesspool Buffoonery Again. How can you almost solely rely on *'...30 days or billing cycle..'* Refund Policy in era of Amazon Prime, or even Electronic Transactions, when absolutely no brand could thrive on such assurances made by dilettantes & Luddites?

&#x200B;

Puma customer service 5-2-19 email:

>*A credit has been applied to your original form of payment and will be appearing on your account in the next few days, if it hasn’t appeared already.*

Shereka M. | Puma Customer Service 5-7-19 email:

>*Refunds are normally posted to your account within 3-5 business days. Occasionally, it can take up to one full billing cycle, depending on your financial institution’s policy.*

&#x200B;

EDIT: Still No Refund by **Friday** \[**5-17**\] late morning (one day after submitting here); I called Puma customer service again, their new update: *'...Refund was re-sent* ***Thur, May 9th*** (8 days prior) *to Financial Institute, depending on their policy, it could take up to* ***May 22nd*** (2 weeks) *for you to see the funds available...'* I insisted that's Not my bank's policy (based on the 5-11 call to bank). I asked why they told me, just 1 Day earlier: '*...the refund was re-sent May 8th and the funds will be available to me by Friday, 17th (today) At The Very LATEST?'* Puma CS Rep said their Rep misspoke and should not have said that several times during the call. I confirmed with bank, before and after that late morning Puma call: NO Refund.

Within the hour the funds were Finally returned to my account.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**tl;dr**: It took Puma **37 Days** to Refund my purchase, from the time I completed their Return Policy.

Puma insisted unforeseeable Exceptions or Delays, affected by all customers, prevented the merchant from returning the funds to my bank for **24 Days,** After Puma Received the Merchandise."

I recently purchased a set of Red Suede classics, [this pair](http://uk.puma.com/uk/en/pd/suede-classic%2B-trainers/352634.html?dwvar_352634_color=team%20regal%20red-white#start=2)

Looking at the image on the site, I was expecting the suede and laces to be a close match in colour. Upon receiving the shoes however, the suede itself is a little more along the pink/pastel red and is visibly different from the laces. I'm not sure how well you might make this out, but [these are the shoes](https://scontent-ams3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13694607_503140146562082_1923621658_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMzc0NDY0Mjk3MDE0ODA1Mw%3D%3D.2) under a regular household bulb, which doesn't help highlight the issue

I was curious as to whether this is an oversight on their behalf or simply the nature of suede. Additionally, the 'white' on the side is more cream than it is white. I'm not overly fussed, just thinking I could pick up something else closer to the red I had in mind and return these.

Any advice/help is appreciated. I don't often buy shoes but I do love Pumas when I do, so I'm a little disappointed in these :("

I'm really interested in these particular sneakers. I found them on Puma official US site but they don't ship them to Europe. Also, they are on a few US webshops, but they seem shady and I would have to pay extra import tax.

Does anybody know a European online seller with these shoes or maybe a legit US website that ships to EU?"

I got these shoes a few years ago and they were the best ive ever had. They were all white, i got them at the puma outlet like 2 years ago and cant find any trace of them online. Why is it so hard to find a shoe.

My best description:

They were all white with a little bit of gold on the tongue where it said puma also their was a small black puma swoosh on the side and i know there was a little bit of gold somewhere else on it but hardly noticeable. On the sole there was a few concave dots on the sides near the back of the heal. The back of the heal had a loop to pull your shoes on. It had a sort of memory foam inside the shoe extremely comfortable like nothing i ever wore before. 

If i had to make a comparison it looks sort of like the tsugi but not at all the same shoe. 

Someone please help and enlighten me, my mom threw them out and i was keeping them to try and get another pair someday.

I have bought all my previous PUMA shoes at size 10.5, my suedes fit like half size longer, but the clyde core foil mid and the ren boot fit well, and since those two I heard run small i assume in PUMA I would be a 10. So should I stay with 10.5 or ""size down"" to a 10 since I heard the Thunder run true to size with a roomier toe box. 

If I still feel insecure I might just go with the regular 10.5 and use them a little roomier since at least my feet would fit."

I was browsing their site when they released, and just ordered then on instinct.  


There's not a lot of info out there about them apart from the same basic info, probably based on some press release. But the way I read it only 73 pairs were made of the blue set.

So my question to anyone more informed than me would be if the 73 count applies per size or in total. I'm guessing the former but have not been able to find anything about it. 

Next I tracked them down on Stock X and was a bit surprised to find that they trade for well under purchase price. Not that I'm looking to sell, it is more that I would expect a set with such low production numbers to attract higher figures.   
Could it be that the rumoured ""73 pairs"" is not true? Or maybe because it has passed a bit under the radar? Or is it simply down to it not really being very ""wearable"" but more of a gimmick?

All knowledge or thoughts  on the subject would be much appreciated. :)"

At any given time, they were my only pair of shoes. Each pair has lasted me somewhere between a year and a year and three months until they started being so worn down that I had to replace them.

My [newest pair](https://imgur.com/a/y04IDO1) only lasted me three months until holes started to appear in the heel area of the sole. Rain water would get into my shoes through the holes and the general walking comfort declined noticeably.

This was my first pair that wasn't all-black; this time they had a white sole. Also, while I usually buy in Europe, this time I bought them in Japan. From an official PUMA store, by the way.

Has PUMA changed something about the design of the sole (more air, less rubber, thinner rubber, different compound) that could account for this? Has anyone else noticed this?

I'm hesitant to buy a new pair now, because I'm not willing to spend another ~90 bucks for shoes that will only last me 3 months. But maybe it was just a one-off?

I've contacted PUMA support and all they had to say (after a three months wait, mind you) was: ""Unfortunately we can't assist you without the receipt and/or the original shoes"".

Is this model worth paying full price of $60-65? I usually only buy shoes on sale, but I sometimes make exceptions because it's so hard to find black mono sneakers that I like. I thought I read one post where the guy said his SoftFoam inserts that came with the shoe disintegrated after 2 weeks... It's a $60 shoe so while that's pretty cheap, I feel like it shouldn't be doing that? Buuuut I don't have a problem of putting in my own Dr. Scholls inserts.

Also, are black mono color ways actually that popular? I'm surprised to see it sold out everywhere except for sketchy 3rd party sites but lighter colors readily available. I read a couple posts where people said that the SoftFoam inserts that came with the shoe disintegrated...

So I wanted to know if the size guide Puma has on their website is basically the length of the insole or is it the outsole? My feet measure around 25.8 cm or 25.9 and judging from that a US size 8 fits me perfectly according to their chart because it's 26 cm but is it actually true to size and are they talking about the inner length of the boot? It would really help if someone here has bought Puma cleats and know if they fit them true to size or if they had to go half up or down. 

I plan on ordering a pair of Future 5.1s but it would be hard for me to return the pair if it's the wrong size so I would rather choose carefully than go through the headache. 

I've had the nemeziz 19.3 cleats but they've grown past their life and these I had in the size US 8.5 but even though Addidas claims they are 25.9 cm long in that size they are still about a cm or half or more of a cm longer. And after breaking in they have quite the room for slippage. Hence I'm looking to buy one with close to perfect length and the rest will just break in with time.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to reply!"

I've had a pair of these Romas for a few years and they're in rough shape now. I believe I got them from Nordstrom Rack. I love the fit and feel--they're textile/canvas so they have a little give--and the regular Romas (leather/suede uppers) feel too narrow on my feet. Do they still make/sell anything similar with material that has some flex to it, preferably not in white? I've found pictures of a black version of these, but honestly I care more for the fit than pattern. Thanks!

I'm a bit desperate here. I had my old Reebok Ventillators at size 9us (42eur). But they are just old and I was looking for some new shoes. 

Really loved the look of the Puma Thunder models but could not find those in stores. So I just blindly ordered new Thunder at the same size as my old Reeboks 9(42). Sadly that was really small and I had to return them. 

Thought maybe all the Pumas are a bit smaller and went to local shop just to try any pair of Puma. And the size was fine on three different models. But all of those were not the ones I wanted! 

So checked again and yeah, sometimes people just say that you should get a half size bigger. And I ordered a new par at 9.5 (42.5). 

Today they arrived, and I really wanted them to fit, but still they are a bit small and now I'll have to also return them. 

I know I'm stubborn and I see no alternative to design of those that I want, so I will order new size 10 (43). 

But before that, just wanted to get some real feedback, if there are any, about the fit of this particular model."

FYI: Their *Free Shipping Returns* can normally take up to a month & their weekday customer service reps can only relay the same info provided on invoice (albeit, their weekend staffers actually investigate & acknowledge exceptions, i.e. merchant error)

* I immediately initiated the Return (on the same day they arrived, never wore the shoes outdoors or for more than 15 minutes) **APRIL 10th** \- USPS electronically received the Return the following day.
* The sneakers didn't arrive at the PUMA Warehouse until **APRIL 23rd** (okay, that's understandable, after all it is *Total Free Returns*). PUMA didn't identify my Returned Merchandise until **APRIL 28th** (*""...the warehouse can get quite busy, and delay's occasional do occur...""*).
* Puma Finally authorized the RETURN and Issued a REFUND on Thursday, **MAY 2nd**. After **another week** and still No Refund back in my account, I call customer service AGAIN, they insist I inquire with my financial institute since they, *'...Definitely Issued the Funds there .. Otherwise it should be there by this Saturday...'*
* Puma CS responds to my **May 7th** e-mail asking the obvious (while outlying aforementioned):

>*Refunds are normally posted to your account within 3-5 business days. Occasionally, it can take up to one full billing cycle, depending on your financial institution’s policy.*

* My bank insists, Saturday a.m. **MAY 11th**, Puma never sent a refund for this (April 7th, $26) transaction and if there is a Refund, it's only been initiated, since there is no Transaction, it only exists Internally, with the merchant. They also offer their assistance (with Puma's customer), giving me the opportunity to call Puma while they continue to hold and invite both parties onto a three-way call, to confirm with Puma: They never relayed a refund to the original payment utilized at Checkout (this is probably the first and most definitive answer I ever received regarding this buffoonery). I call Puma CS and fortunately, reach a genuine representative with some common-core-sense, who almost immediately acknowledges I should have *'...seen the REFUND over a week ago;'* She also (finally) divulges: *'Our credit department had a* *""conflict""* *with Refunds issued on MAY 2nd. Your refund was also, likely affected by the* ***May 2nd Refund Exception*** *... I'd expedite your case* (Refund) *on Monday when* \[the department\] *is back in the office; You should see it by* ***WEDNESDAY, May 15th*** (72-hrs) *AT THE LATEST*\*.'\*
* I called Puma Wednesday morning, **MAY 15th,** to speak to a manager who wouldn't even acknowledge previously stated May 2nd ""Refund Errors"" and only wanted to discuss their Refund Policy (timeline) and New Opportunity: Why not cancel the Full ReFUNDs and accept a Puma Shopping Credit for equal amount? I couldn't use the credit right away since it could take up to 72-hrs for it to appear in my Puma Store account (I'm certain that service manager is now enrolled in a 30-day treatment program). She continued, *'...otherwise it could take up to 30-DAYS, from* ***May 2nd***\*, For the Funds to be Returned...'\* (She for sure confirmed the *'30-days* start *.. from May 2nd'*)
* I called back this morning (Still No Refund) and the representative now says (after fully acknowledging their *'May 2nd Company-wide Refund-Hiccup'*) that, *'...a New Refund was issued* ***May 8th*** *(8 Days ago) and the Refund Should Definitely Be There* *~~TODAY~~* *TOMORROW!'*

F U puma and your Totally Free Returns Hogwash-Snakeoil. I will NEVER patronize your Cesspool Buffoonery Again. How can you almost solely rely on *'...30 days or billing cycle..'* Refund Policy in era of Amazon Prime, or even Electronic Transactions, when absolutely no brand could thrive on such assurances made by dilettantes & Luddites?

EDIT: Still No Refund by **Friday** \[**5-17**\] late morning (one day after submitting here); I called Puma customer service again, their new update: *'...Refund was re-sent* ***Thur, May 9th*** (8 days prior) *to Financial Institute, depending on their policy, it could take up to* ***May 22nd*** (2 weeks) *for you to see the funds available...'* I insisted that's Not my bank's policy (based on the 5-11 call to bank). I asked why they told me, just 1 Day earlier: '*...the refund was re-sent May 8th and the funds will be available to me by Friday, 17th (today) At The Very LATEST?'* Puma CS Rep said their Rep misspoke and should not have said that several times during the call. I confirmed with bank, before and after that late morning Puma call: NO Refund.

Within the hour the funds were Finally returned to my account.

**tl;dr**: It took Puma **37 Days** to Refund my purchase, from the time I completed their Return Policy.

I got these shoes a few years ago and they were the best ive ever had. They were all white, i got them at the puma outlet like 2 years ago and cant find any trace of them online. Why is it so hard to find a shoe.

My best description:

They were all white with a little bit of gold on the tongue where it said puma also their was a small black puma swoosh on the side and i know there was a little bit of gold somewhere else on it but hardly noticeable. On the sole there was a few concave dots on the sides near the back of the heal. The back of the heal had a loop to pull your shoes on. It had a sort of memory foam inside the shoe extremely comfortable like nothing i ever wore before. 

If i had to make a comparison it looks sort of like the tsugi but not at all the same shoe. 

Someone please help and enlighten me, my mom threw them out and i was keeping them to try and get another pair someday.

I like the design, particularly the way that the sole is thin and does not cover any of the body of the shoe, and they are very comfortable to walk around in.

Can't find them on the Puma website, and most online sellers have limited sizes / colors -- any suggestions for where I might find these, or for a similar shoe to switch to?"

Now I want to buy them again, or an equivalent model, but i can't find them anywhere. Can someone suggest me where to find these incredible shoes? Order them online should not be a problem."

  Backstory: I overheard someone say ""Yeah Arthur (me) got these too... but his are fake. They are too expensive. I got these in black.""  
  I don't know which shoes they talk about but i know i bought all my other shoes from legit stores so i don't care if other people think they are fake. The most expensive shoes i got are Nike Socfly for 110€ at that time. But i didn't buy the Puma Suedes, they were a gift from my ex so i don't know the origin exactly.  
  I don't really care if they are not original for fashion/money reasons i just think it's weird for someone to gift fake shoes so i'm asking if someone can tell by fact if these are legit.  
  Also i think it's weird that this person said ""they are too expensive""... if i look these up they are 50-70€. If that person meant other shoes, it doesn't matter anymore because i know for sure where i bought them. Thanks for anyone taking time to check these out!"

So I was surfing the net for some Pumas and I've found out something I didn't find a proper answer to, what is the difference between these 2 pairs apart from the price?

Black-white 03 model: https://www.amazon.es/Puma-Classic-Zapatillas-Unisex-Black-White/dp/B004SGJRTC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472060821&sr=8-1&keywords=puma

Black/white model: idk how to find the right link for this model, but if you go to ''color'' and list the model I mentioned (black/white) you will see it.

Thanks!!"
2701,Red Puma Suede Classic Question,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUMA/comments/4zcx5b/red_puma_suede_classic_question/,6,2016-08-24 10:45:36,"Hi guys, 

I recently purchased a set of Red Suede classics, [this pair](http://uk.puma.com/uk/en/pd/suede-classic%2B-trainers/352634.html?dwvar_352634_color=team%20regal%20red-white#start=2)

Looking at the image on the site, I was expecting the suede and laces to be a close match in colour. Upon receiving the shoes however, the suede itself is a little more along the pink/pastel red and is visibly different from the laces. I'm not sure how well you might make this out, but [these are the shoes](https://scontent-ams3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13694607_503140146562082_1923621658_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMzc0NDY0Mjk3MDE0ODA1Mw%3D%3D.2) under a regular household bulb, which doesn't help highlight the issue

I was curious as to whether this is an oversight on their behalf or simply the nature of suede. Additionally, the 'white' on the side is more cream than it is white. I'm not overly fussed, just thinking I could pick up something else closer to the red I had in mind and return these.

Any advice/help is appreciated. I don't often buy shoes but I do love Pumas when I do, so I'm a little disappointed in these :("
