I'm six feet tall and about 165 pounds, which means I'm pretty lanky. Based on the models on the page, their 6 ft guy wore a medium, so that, along with some additional research, was what I ultimately based my decision on since I didn't have a measuring tape and that was my first time buying from Gymshark.

However, I do feel like they are a bit, for lack of a better word, puffy(?), as in there seems to be a bit of extra material around the leg openings. When I do things like squats in them, the openings do seem to slide up my thighs a bit.

Is this how it should be given my height, or should I go a size down? I'm new to this brand so I don't know if that would really solve the issue. I just don't want to look silly with extra fabric around my relatively thin thighs! I also tried to estimate my size measurements and they do seem to match that of a small, despite my height matching that of the guy wearing a medium. 

Any responses or advice would be appreciated. I could always just use the extra material as motivation to beef up my legs too. :)"

I had trouble getting the bottom of the leggings over my heel because it wouldn't stretch much at all. They fit my thighs just fine, but there was a huge gap at the back of my waist. I couldn't imagine working out in them because the material felt so non-stretchy and rubbery.

Anyways, I want more leggings lol but since majority of the Adapt/Breeze Lightweight collection is sold out I started looking at other collections. In comparison to the Adapt collection, how do the Vital/Vital 2.0 measure up?

The main difference I've deduced from YT videos is that the Vital 2.0 have more compression on the waist band and some found it to be uncomfortable. My question is, how compressive are we talking? I love the compression of the Adapt leggings so if Vital 2.0 is similar to that then I have  no problem. However, if it is more compressive then maybe I will go with the OG Vitals...

I wear a size S in all leggings. If I were to purchase the Vital 2.0 I would get a S. If I were to purchase the OG Vitals, I'm wondering if I should stick with a S or size down to an XS to accommodate the gaping waist band. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!"

My question is for the ladies who have a big butt and have sized down. Were they much more see through? I am a large. But am curious if medium vital 2.0 would fit better but I don’t want to risk it being more see through. The vital 2.0 is the pink color outfit and I’ve been wanting a pink outfit for so long.

6 was absolutely perfect on my waist. 8 had a slight gap but nothing serious and 10 was loose on the waist. 

I want leggings that I can move around in and they stay secure. In 6s and 8s they didnt budge when I jumped and did high knees. The 10 fell.

However I have humongous calves and thighs that I think are mostly fat. So I think size 10 fit my legs best. I even tried on size 10 of the ones with the drawstring but it was still too big on my waist.

My waist is approx 28 inches and I have no butt lol so my hips are approx 39. So according to that measurement a medium in gymshark should fit right? I'm scared cause I've never fit a medium in my life. I'm also the smallest I've ever been in my life but still quite big imo.

\-Veer T-Shirt

\-Arrival T-Shirt

\-Critical T-Shirt

\-Arrival Woven Joggers

\-**Geo Lightweight Seamless T-Shirt and;**

**-Vital Seamless T-Shirt**

&#x200B;

First 4 are good.

The last two products look and feel nice. But their stitching quality is just garbage. The sleeves on the Geo Lightweight came undone and there's a small hole on the body. They used the cheapest and weakest thread you can imagine to sew the sleeves and the lower body hem. Same goes for the Vital Seamless. The stiches are such poor quality, you can just take it apart using your nails with little effort.

 I've had $10 Walmart t-shirts hold up better than this. The thing is, the last 2 are in the higher price category of their t-shirts. 

I obviously contacted support and will try to get a refund for this and return a couple items I haven't yet worn.

I’ve tried both, but I’m wondering if anyone with the same measurements has either size. I like the more compression of the S (although more tight to get on), and the waistband feels secure and tight but not too tight. I don’t feel like there is that much stretch left in the S tho when on. The M feels chill, less tight and less compression. The waistband feels good and isn’t tight at all, but I’m worried it’s too loose. I’m afraid it will fall down during training, and doesn’t feel as secure. Glutes look better in M and there’s more stretch to the fabric when on. Thanks!

Recently i bought a new pair of leggings from another brand with the size XS and although they were a tight fit they hugged my waist a lot better. I wanted to ask if I should size down with my next gymshark order? Is the XS very small or is it stretchy enough for me?

edit: Also, does gymshark normally have a compressive waistband? Feel free to give any advice or suggestions for high waisted leggings!"

So I just bought a pair of white sport shorts and black arrival pants. After trying them on, I noticed that they’re very tight and expose the peen area. Does anyone else have this issue?...What worked best for you?...Both of the bottoms are a medium and as a reference I’m 5’9 180lbs. When ordering I compared it to other brands such as Nike, UA, Adidas who have similar products and sizing. The Gymshark pants are similar to those from a Nike running line.Also the white sports shorts are made of very thin material, you can see the inside pocket lining/underwear colour. Anyone know whats the best colour to wear under white so that it won’t be see through? Thanks."

I did finally try some xs leggings, and they are amazing for sure. I want to try more Gymshark but maybe I'll wait to order when I'm back in the states and returns are free because it's too risky for me otherwise. I may order once more and then stop. Lol!

**ETA, :** I actually ended up ordering an xs for two leggings. I was excited to try them, but they arrived DAMAGED! I have tried contacting CS to no avail. I won't be ordering from Gymshark again.

Hey there.

I just got Gymshark clothes for the first time this Black Friday. In this review I discuss the camo seamless and vital seamless. I do yoga and running primarily and bought these clothes for those sports. In the future, I hope to get back to doing lifts in the gym. **My measurements are 5 ft 8 in, 32D, waist: 27 inch, hips: 39 inch.**

In the *vital seamless, size small, blue marl,* when I do a [squat](https://imgur.com/a/6c7QXdd) you can see that the waistband opens up in the back. It doesn't show my underwear (which is a leggings disaster basically), but it opening up makes me feel exposed. It does pass the 'squat [test](https://imgur.com/a/bDPv4TJ)' in that my underwear isn't showing through. I'm wearing a black thong in the GIF, but when I wore a bright pink thong with the light green camo seamless set, there was no issue.

Now for actual yoga, I have to sadly say the waistband moves more than I want! Going from [down dog](https://imgur.com/a/E5SB95S) to one leg causes the waistband to open. Then to [warrior one](https://imgur.com/a/wqaxUDh) my waistband is all the way down not covering my belly! Then I have to adjust when moving to [warrior two](https://imgur.com/a/Wl6eJwV). Warrior two to [triangle](https://imgur.com/a/V152hM2) is okay. Then when I go through the vinyasa at the end from down dog to [child pose](https://imgur.com/a/ifPHEZE) you see the waistband open up again!

Now that leaves me wondering if I should get a size xs. I like the fit in my butt and thighs, but the waistband moving really annoys me!

**Tldr**: **My measurements are 5 ft 8 in, 32D, waist: 27 inch, hips: 39 inch.** I reviewed the size small in gymshark vital seamless, marl blue, and camo seamless, light green. They have good material and structure. I hate the waistband because it moves around a lot and *could* leave me exposed in some moves. I may try xs in the future."

My measurements are 27"" waist, 40"" hips /butt, and the biggest parts of my thigh is 25"". I have a muscular build. According to their size chart I am between a small and medium. People would likely reccomend wear a small however that does not work for me. I have tried a small and ripped them pulling them up my thighs. My advice would be stick to what you wear in other brands sizes. If you're a small, get a small if you're a large get a large.  Done size down from your waist side either. Just because they stretch does not mean that it's going to fit. This is what causes their gear to wear out quicker. I use to work for Lululemon so I am pretty familiar with active wear fittings..

It's my first time buying gymshark so I have nothing to compare, I'm really disappointed with the quality of the leggings (the logo doesn't hold on, the fit isn't that great my h&m leggings are better, there is a mini tear in the back from a missing thread...) for information. But I heard such good things about the brand I'm wondering if mine are counterfeit or something... Did some of you have a similar experience?"

I like the original Camo because they are a thicker material and fairly compressive on me in a size medium! I like that they hold me in when doing cardio and don’t budge with squats. Not sure if that’s because they are thicker/more compressive material or just don’t have as much stretch as other leggings, but I really like that!

285,Am I the only one disappointed in the Whitney Simmons second collection?,15,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymshark/comments/jrueey/am_i_the_only_one_disappointed_in_the_whitney/,14,2020-11-10 16:47:11,"So putting aside how poor the management of the collection was regarding stocking, purchasing and from what I've heard, shipping as well, I'm honestly pretty disappointed in the lighter coloured leggings. I only managed to get my hands on the blue and red ribbed leggings and gee they are not worth the money they cost me. Wore the blue for the first time today on a relatively light day at the gym, nothing high intensity but I was still sweating. I had visible sweat patches within 5min of warming up. They dry ok, not particularly quickly. 

Holy moly the red. I normally wear a black thong to workout and I could see my underwear from the front when I tried the red on. I understand lighter colours not being completely squat proof but I was just standing there and there was an obvious shadow where my underwear was. I know lighter colours tend not to be as sweat proof or squat proof but I expected better from gymshark ngl. 
 
Holy moly I just wore the shorts for sport and they ride up so badly! I don't think I can even wear them again. I was constantly pulling them down and adjusting them. This collection is finding new ways to disappoint me. 

Anyone else having trouble with the products from this launch??"

319,Sizing confusion,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymshark/comments/jkkb7p/sizing_confusion/,2,2020-10-29 18:26:59,"So I am really interested in purchasing the flex shorts, however I have always put off buying from Gymshark due to the confusion about the sizing since I am in between sizes.

My waist is 33' which makes me an XL  
41' in the hips which makes me a S  
75' inside the leg which makes me an XS

Keep in mind that I do have a fair bit of belly fat, which makes waistbands fall down. From Echt I am an XL in everything and both Echt and Gymshark have the exact same size guide so I have been basing my decision on that. I have been opting for a L since it fits perfectly around the hips, but feel as though it would sit better on my waist if I went with an XL (only issue is that leaves me with extra fabric around my hips and legs).

Are the flex shorts as compressive as they look? Could I fit into a L if I wanted to? And can sizes vary according to the different types of fabrics used amongst all the leggings and shorts? Any help would be much appreciated!"

323,Does Gymshark ever bring back older collections?,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymshark/comments/jj58ni/does_gymshark_ever_bring_back_older_collections/,2,2020-10-27 13:10:54,"I \[M25, Canada\] started becoming a Gymshark buyer around 2017. Around that time, they had some really incredible quality clothing from the Ark collection. I bought a nice black sweater from the Ark collection that was sleek and great to wear both casually and at the gym, as well as a pair of shorts that had a back pocket and was awesome for deadlifting in.

I've inquired this question myself to their Customer support team, but they always tell me to keep checking periodically. It's been about 2 years since they've had the Ark Collection. They've recommended the Critical Collection as a close alternative. But their Critical Collection, in my opinion, isn't the greatest quality and their sizing seems entirely off compared to the Ark collection.

For those who have supported the brand for much longer, does Gymshark ever bring back older collections?"

I've been wanting to order Gymshark clothing for quite a while now but am honestly a bit worried about the fit. My hips are 45"" which would suggest I get a L, but my waist is 35"" and the biggest waist size in the chart is 32"" (30"" for a size L).

For reference, I'm generally a size L (10) in Fabletics high compression styles, and I believe I have a pair of Lululemon Wunder Under Luxtreme leggings that are either a size 8 or 10 (I bought them over 6 years ago so I honestly can't remember lol).  I'm usually a size 12 in jeans, but don't wear them often haha.

I've looked up a lot of reviews, and it does seem that the sizes aren't necessarily true to the sizing chart, given that a lot of plus sized girls online find that the XL still fits them well in some leggings. What size should I be considering in these styles? I've also read that sizing can vary depending on the fabric!

I’m just wondering how you feel about the quality about the products. 

The reason that I’m asking this is because I just received my first order a few days ago (1 shirt, sweater and joggingpants) and the t-shirt already came with a hole in it, so I immediatly contacted support to get this sorted out. 

Today I went to the gym with my Gymshark clothes and before even entering the gym the zipper of my joggingspants came of on one side. (I can’t seem to get it on there again)

Now I’m really in doubt of the quality, especially since it’s the first time ordering here and already 2/3 products are broken. I’m also a bit worried about contacting support again because it seems like I’m complaining too much.

Sportswear and atheletic gear has really evolved, Nike in particular has been killing it making fucntional products that look great.

Your stuff doesnt look great. It looks very cheap, like using an epson ink jet and hanes blanks cheap. Like worse than a local pop punk bands merch cheap.

And thats just the material, the logos look very generic, nothing pops, nothing memorable, i honestly find nicer t-shirts thrifting from high school plays, charity runs, local breweries, and beer leagues. None of your pieces have cohesive design language. You need to work on those fonts too. There just hasnt been enough thought and effort put into this entire line. I see alot of really dynamic, instagram based, diy, indie as fuck, 1 man shows that are changing the entire game. To me under armour is too cheap and basic id never wear it, but to thsoe that do, why would they pick Gym Shark? You cant compete with those prices and sales and big retailers, so you gotta offer something we cant already get elsewhere, for cheaper and better. 

If you going after the hardcore fitness crowd, remove the heavy branding, focus on material quality and aestetic, that demo doesnt want someones name to look cool, they wanna show off their work. Its the weekend warriors that arent serious that wear those Shirts with huge, aggressive bold text about winning and losers and gains. So you wanna be like Nike if they just sold the shirts that the doucebags wear?

And the womens stuff, yikes, i see better quality on Champions CB discount store sub brand, LuLuLemon is poor quality as well, but at least it looks hot. They are selling sex and its working, no matter how many pictures of ripped tights spread around social media. When Victorias Secret has sales, you can get better quality for a fraction of the price. 

Im sure the success Gym Shark is seeing is the result of algorithims and ai, machine learning, next level social engineerig, this is a masterful use of the power of marketing, but im afraid the results are in, and the product doesnt live up to the hype."

423,Tank top edges are curling,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymshark/comments/hpx18j/tank_top_edges_are_curling/,1,2020-07-12 12:19:02,"I’m a guy who owns two gymshark tank tops and let’s just get this straight. I love them. My brother also loves them and owns several himself. They’re airy, they look amazing and enough good can’t be said about them. They do have one caveat however and it’s something we’ve both experienced. The edges of the fabric that run along the edges of the arm holes seem to have curled in towards the body, shrinking the dimension of this top across the chest. The tops were fine when they arrived but for some reason after washing this is a perpetual problem. Ironing doesn’t solve it and besides that I can’t really think of any other solution. 

Right now they’re great for home workouts etc. but in the interests of having respect for other gym users and not constantly exposing my nips to everyone around me, I don’t suppose anyone has any suggestions as to how to ameliorate this?"

i ordered a package that i was REALLY looking forward to receiving (shorts that i was dying to get) and during that same week i had made like 3 other orders that all arrived, however this package in particular just stopped moving when it arrived at the international facility in Memphis.

i was so sus about the whole thing bc one of my other packages had arrived open and i kind of just brushed it off.

anyway, i decided to get in contact with FedEx customer service and they said they would search for the package, but later when i called for an update- the man i was speaking to literally told me a lot of gymshark packages that end up going missing usually aren’t found, and that there’s been instances where packages arrive to customers empty (i’ve heard of that happening). he basically told me i should expect a call in a few days if my package is or isn’t located and then i can talk to gymshark about it.

i guess this is kind of a rant, but i wanna know if anyone has had a similar experience"

I really enjoy most of the products I’ve bought from gymshark so far (6 pairs of leggings and three bras). I left reviews a while ago on the racer back training bra and the zip up training bra. I love love love the racer back bra but the zip up one is cute and okay, the zipper is irritation and needs more material behind it to prevent skin irritations. The thing that’s weird is the reviews still aren’t on the website?? Even the glowing review for the racer back bra. Has anyone else left reviews for them not to be posted? They have a suspiciously small to no reviews on their website and after my reviews didn’t get posted, I started to get suspicious. What do you guys think? Do you think they’re deliberately not putting reviews on their website?"

I just ordered my first set of clothes from gymshark and I’m so excited to use them! While ordering the clothes I made sure to take my measurements and go by the size guide of each item but now that I’m trying them on I’m not so sure if they’re fitting correctly. 

I bought every item in an extra small. 
These are my measurements:
Bust - 34”/86cm
Waist - 27”/68.5cm
Hips - 38”/96.5cm

Items bought: Vital seamless leggings in marl jade, Vital seamless crop top in marl jade, Camo seamless leggings in lavender grey. 

From what the size guide said I should’ve been okay with an extra small (it’s mainly the hips I was concerned about) however they were SUPER hard to get on and I’m just not sure how they’re supposed to feel while they’re on. In addition, the vital seamless leggings did show a bit of sheerness while I was squatting in them:/

My girlfriend loves her Gym Shark leggings and I'd like to purchase 2-3 more pairs for her. 

My head is spinning a bit because there are SO MANY types and fits for these leggings. 

She is 5'3"", and definitely has a butt which causes issues for her when putting on leggings. She's not a fan of compressing waistbands

Here's what I do know, I think she has this pair which she likes - https://www.gymshark.com/collections/bottoms/products/gymshark-dreamy-leggings-black-white

Does not like this one because she thinks the waistband is too tight - https://www.gymshark.com/collections/leggings/products/gymshark-fit-leggings-black-black

I recently received my second ever order from Gymshark. I had ordered the Camo leggings as well as the Energy+ Seamless leggings, both size M. The Camo leggings fit perfectly, but when i tried on the Energy leggings, they were super loose in the ankle.

I’m hoping it’s just a manufacturer error, but essentially the width of the calf on these leggings is the same as the ankle, meaning they fall straight down instead of hugging tight to the leg. I am going to return them, however i’m worried about ordering another pair and having the same issue. They fit perfectly everywhere else on me!

Anyone have a similar problem?"

So i’m on the chunkier side of the spectrum, so i was hesitant to buy GS clothing because i know it’s tight fitting, BUT WOW IM SHOOK. 

i got all of my clothes in medium as a heads up 
black bomber jacket -amazing fit like it felt as if it was made for me 

critical zip up- amazing material tight on the forearms *which was good like it wasn’t bad* and a very slim fit on my hips and sides it’s good 

critical hoodie- absolutely perfect 

critical t shirts were iffy bc they were a little too tight maybe a large but i feel like once i lose some weight from my belly they’ll fit better
but who knows 

critical joggers- loose on the thighs and a slimmer fit on the calves. *i have yam like calves but they fit like a glove* 

tapered bottoms joggers- a bit tighter on the calves but thighs were great and i love the pockets 

idk i hope this helped someone or if gymshark sees this then great they’ll get some feedback."

Not to mention that I feel like their recent designs are not appealing/flattering whatsoever. If you go on Buffbunny or Alphalete's website, almost everything is sold out. I feel like Gymshark is trying to become bigger in order to compete with other quickly rising companies. I have recently decided that I am not a huge fan of the way their stuff fits, and would go as far to say that it feels quite cheap.. feels like everything has gone downhill since Krissy Cela left lol.

It will also be able to get your sizes in other brands if you know your size in a specific brand. Eg size 4 in lululemon = size xs/s in gymshark depending on the fabric.

I only managed to get my hands on the blue and red ribbed leggings and gee they are not worth the money they cost me. Wore the blue for the first time today on a relatively light day at the gym, nothing high intensity but I was still sweating. I had visible sweat patches within 5min of warming up. They dry ok, not particularly quickly. 

Holy moly the red. I normally wear a black thong to workout and I could see my underwear from the front when I tried the red on. I understand lighter colours not being completely squat proof but I was just standing there and there was an obvious shadow where my underwear was. I know lighter colours tend not to be as sweat proof or squat proof but I expected better from gymshark ngl. 
 
Holy moly I just wore the shorts for sport and they ride up so badly! I don't think I can even wear them again. I was constantly pulling them down and adjusting them. This collection is finding new ways to disappoint me. 

Anyone else having trouble with the products from this launch??"

Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like they're cranking out a crap ton of new products? I was just on their website yesterday and it looks like hardly anything is selling, whereas back in the day almost everything would be gone. When they release new lines now, they don't sell as fast. Not to mention that I feel like their recent designs are not appealing/flattering whatsoever. If you go on Buffbunny or Alphalete's website, almost everything is sold out. I feel like Gymshark is trying to become bigger in order to compete with other quickly rising companies. I have recently decided that I am not a huge fan of the way their stuff fits, and would go as far to say that it feels quite cheap.. feels like everything has gone downhill since Krissy Cela left lol. Also feel like there isn't as much hype as there used to be from social media influencers. Anyone else agree?"

They have so much money but can't build a few more factories and get some product back on their website. I bet I know exactly what will happen. They will re stock and be sold out in a few days as usual. I couldn't care less about new releases. It seems like they just release new items but re stock old ones every 6 months.

**Greetings,**

I would like to introduce myself as the new moderator of the r/Gymshark Community, for a long time this sub has been neglected a bit and I would like to clean it up for the benefit of everyone. I would like the input of the community as to where we should take this sub!

So I am asking the community for:

1. Moderator Applications - Please message via the ModMail if you're interested in coming on board to help out.
2. Suggestions for the community, what could we do to make it more active/useful?
3. Any feedback

I am further proposing an update to flairs, the wiki and rules but this will all come in due course.

Thanks

&#x200B;

Update 08/04/20 - I have updated the Thread flairs to make it easier to identify topics and have also added user flairs!

Update 16/05/20 - We reached 1K members!!!! We are now on the road to 10K, Please make sure you check out the Gymshark rules as appropriate action will be taken if these rules are deemed to be broken.

My question is - do you know of any brands you like that have a similar fit/style to Gymshark Apollo shirts?

747,Should I order a medium or large?,5,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymshark/comments/mkzusu/should_i_order_a_medium_or_large/,7,2021-04-05 21:08:43,"I went to the lululemon store to see which size fits me best. 8 fit the best. I tried 6, 8, and 10.

6 was absolutely perfect on my waist. 8 had a slight gap but nothing serious and 10 was loose on the waist. 

I want leggings that I can move around in and they stay secure. In 6s and 8s they didnt budge when I jumped and did high knees. The 10 fell.

However I have humongous calves and thighs that I think are mostly fat. So I think size 10 fit my legs best. I even tried on size 10 of the ones with the drawstring but it was still too big on my waist.

My waist is approx 28 inches and I have no butt lol so my hips are approx 39. So according to that measurement a medium in gymshark should fit right? I'm scared cause I've never fit a medium in my life. I'm also the smallest I've ever been in my life but still quite big imo. I keep looking at girls wearing mediums on youtube and they look so tiny compared to me... so I feel like I shouldn't be ordering a medium. But I also don't know if it's all in my head.

I’m just wondering how you feel about the quality about the products. 

The reason that I’m asking this is because I just received my first order a few days ago (1 shirt, sweater and joggingpants) and the t-shirt already came with a hole in it, so I immediatly contacted support to get this sorted out. 

Today I went to the gym with my Gymshark clothes and before even entering the gym the zipper of my joggingspants came of on one side. (I can’t seem to get it on there again)

Now I’m really in doubt of the quality, especially since it’s the first time ordering here and already 2/3 products are broken. I’m also a bit worried about contacting support again because it seems like I’m complaining too much.

Anyone who had this happened aswell/who perhaps knows how I can fix the zipper?"

**-Vital Seamless T-Shirt**

&#x200B;

First 4 are good.

The last two products look and feel nice. But their stitching quality is just garbage. The sleeves on the Geo Lightweight came undone and there's a small hole on the body. They used the cheapest and weakest thread you can imagine to sew the sleeves and the lower body hem. Same goes for the Vital Seamless. The stiches are such poor quality, you can just take it apart using your nails with little effort.

 I've had $10 Walmart t-shirts hold up better than this. The thing is, the last 2 are in the higher price category of their t-shirts. 

I obviously contacted support and will try to get a refund for this and return a couple items I haven't yet worn.

**ETA, :** I actually ended up ordering an xs for two leggings. I was excited to try them, but they arrived DAMAGED! I have tried contacting CS to no avail. I won't be ordering from Gymshark again.

Hey there.

I just got Gymshark clothes for the first time this Black Friday. In this review I discuss the camo seamless and vital seamless. I do yoga and running primarily and bought these clothes for those sports. In the future, I hope to get back to doing lifts in the gym. **My measurements are 5 ft 8 in, 32D, waist: 27 inch, hips: 39 inch.**

In the *vital seamless, size small, blue marl,* when I do a [squat](https://imgur.com/a/6c7QXdd) you can see that the waistband opens up in the back. It doesn't show my underwear (which is a leggings disaster basically), but it opening up makes me feel exposed. It does pass the 'squat [test](https://imgur.com/a/bDPv4TJ)' in that my underwear isn't showing through. I'm wearing a black thong in the GIF, but when I wore a bright pink thong with the light green camo seamless set, there was no issue.

Now for actual yoga, I have to sadly say the waistband moves more than I want! Going from [down dog](https://imgur.com/a/E5SB95S) to one leg causes the waistband to open. Then to [warrior one](https://imgur.com/a/wqaxUDh) my waistband is all the way down not covering my belly! Then I have to adjust when moving to [warrior two](https://imgur.com/a/Wl6eJwV). Warrior two to [triangle](https://imgur.com/a/V152hM2) is okay. Then when I go through the vinyasa at the end from down dog to [child pose](https://imgur.com/a/ifPHEZE) you see the waistband open up again!

Now that leaves me wondering if I should get a size xs. I like the fit in my butt and thighs, but the waistband moving really annoys me!

**Tldr**: **My measurements are 5 ft 8 in, 32D, waist: 27 inch, hips: 39 inch.** I reviewed the size small in gymshark vital seamless, marl blue, and camo seamless, light green. They have good material and structure. I hate the waistband because it moves around a lot and *could* leave me exposed in some moves. I may try xs in the future."

So i’m on the chunkier side of the spectrum, so i was hesitant to buy GS clothing because i know it’s tight fitting, BUT WOW IM SHOOK. 

i got all of my clothes in medium as a heads up 
black bomber jacket -amazing fit like it felt as if it was made for me 

critical zip up- amazing material tight on the forearms *which was good like it wasn’t bad* and a very slim fit on my hips and sides it’s good 

critical hoodie- absolutely perfect 

critical t shirts were iffy bc they were a little too tight maybe a large but i feel like once i lose some weight from my belly they’ll fit better
but who knows 

critical joggers- loose on the thighs and a slimmer fit on the calves. *i have yam like calves but they fit like a glove* 

tapered bottoms joggers- a bit tighter on the calves but thighs were great and i love the pockets 

idk i hope this helped someone or if gymshark sees this then great they’ll get some feedback."

But am curious if medium vital 2.0 would fit better but I don’t want to risk it being more see through. The vital 2.0 is the pink color outfit and I’ve been wanting a pink outfit for so long.

I’ve tried both, but I’m wondering if anyone with the same measurements has either size. I like the more compression of the S (although more tight to get on), and the waistband feels secure and tight but not too tight. I don’t feel like there is that much stretch left in the S tho when on. The M feels chill, less tight and less compression. The waistband feels good and isn’t tight at all, but I’m worried it’s too loose. I’m afraid it will fall down during training, and doesn’t feel as secure. Glutes look better in M and there’s more stretch to the fabric when on. Thanks!

i was so sus about the whole thing bc one of my other packages had arrived open and i kind of just brushed it off.

anyway, i decided to get in contact with FedEx customer service and they said they would search for the package, but later when i called for an update- the man i was speaking to literally told me a lot of gymshark packages that end up going missing usually aren’t found, and that there’s been instances where packages arrive to customers empty (i’ve heard of that happening). he basically told me i should expect a call in a few days if my package is or isn’t located and then i can talk to gymshark about it.

I bought every item in an extra small. 
These are my measurements:
Bust - 34”/86cm
Waist - 27”/68.5cm
Hips - 38”/96.5cm

Items bought: Vital seamless leggings in marl jade, Vital seamless crop top in marl jade, Camo seamless leggings in lavender grey. 

From what the size guide said I should’ve been okay with an extra small (it’s mainly the hips I was concerned about) however they were SUPER hard to get on and I’m just not sure how they’re supposed to feel while they’re on.

My girlfriend loves her Gym Shark leggings and I'd like to purchase 2-3 more pairs for her. 

My head is spinning a bit because there are SO MANY types and fits for these leggings. 

She is 5'3"", and definitely has a butt which causes issues for her when putting on leggings. She's not a fan of compressing waistbands

Here's what I do know, I think she has this pair which she likes - https://www.gymshark.com/collections/bottoms/products/gymshark-dreamy-leggings-black-white

Does not like this one because she thinks the waistband is too tight - https://www.gymshark.com/collections/leggings/products/gymshark-fit-leggings-black-black

I was considering the [Lustre](https://www.gymshark.com/products/gymshark-lustre-leggings-black) and the [Vital](https://www.gymshark.com/collections/leggings/products/gymshark-vital-seamless-leggings-black-marl)

Female.
Waist = 31” (I have belly fat)
Hips = 42”
Height = 5’3” (I know they’ll be long on me)


The pair I’m looking at is the Camo Seamless in black but according to their size chart my waist is between an L and an XL which makes sense but my hips put me between a S and an M. There’s no way I’m an S but should I be sizing these leggings to my hips or to my waist?

I had trouble getting the bottom of the leggings over my heel because it wouldn't stretch much at all. They fit my thighs just fine, but there was a huge gap at the back of my waist. I couldn't imagine working out in them because the material felt so non-stretchy and rubbery.

I decided to post some pics to see if it could help some of the ladies that have questions. I am a size 6 in Lululemon and a medium in Under Armour, Nike and Adidas . I wear a size M in gymshark. My measurements are 27"" waist, 40"" hips /butt, and the biggest parts of my thigh is 25"". I have a muscular build. According to their size chart I am between a small and medium. People would likely reccomend wear a small however that does not work for me. I have tried a small and ripped them pulling them up my thighs. My advice would be stick to what you wear in other brands sizes. If you're a small, get a small if you're a large get a large.  Done size down from your waist side either. Just because they stretch does not mean that it's going to fit. This is what causes their gear to wear out quicker. I use to work for Lululemon so I am pretty familiar with active wear fittings..

I'm six feet tall and about 165 pounds, which means I'm pretty lanky. Based on the models on the page, their 6 ft guy wore a medium, so that, along with some additional research, was what I ultimately based my decision on since I didn't have a measuring tape and that was my first time buying from Gymshark.

However, I do feel like they are a bit, for lack of a better word, puffy(?), as in there seems to be a bit of extra material around the leg openings. When I do things like squats in them, the openings do seem to slide up my thighs a bit.

Is this how it should be given my height, or should I go a size down? I'm new to this brand so I don't know if that would really solve the issue. I just don't want to look silly with extra fabric around my relatively thin thighs! I also tried to estimate my size measurements and they do seem to match that of a small, despite my height matching that of the guy wearing a medium. 

Any responses or advice would be appreciated. I could always just use the extra material as motivation to beef up my legs too. :)"

I’ve worn each pair to the gym twice as my gym has only just opened due to COVID restrictions and the waiting list etc. I’ve noticed that the logo on one pair has started to peel off.

Some photos of the peeling here: https://imgur.com/gallery/iQ70CoK

My waist is 33' which makes me an XL  
41' in the hips which makes me a S  
75' inside the leg which makes me an XS

Keep in mind that I do have a fair bit of belly fat, which makes waistbands fall down. From Echt I am an XL in everything and both Echt and Gymshark have the exact same size guide so I have been basing my decision on that. I have been opting for a L since it fits perfectly around the hips, but feel as though it would sit better on my waist if I went with an XL (only issue is that leaves me with extra fabric around my hips and legs).

Are the flex shorts as compressive as they look? Could I fit into a L if I wanted to? And can sizes vary according to the different types of fabrics used amongst all the leggings and shorts? Any help would be much appreciated!"

I've inquired this question myself to their Customer support team, but they always tell me to keep checking periodically. It's been about 2 years since they've had the Ark Collection. They've recommended the Critical Collection as a close alternative. But their Critical Collection, in my opinion, isn't the greatest quality and their sizing seems entirely off compared to the Ark collection.

I'm usually a size 12 in jeans, but don't wear them often haha.

I've looked up a lot of reviews, and it does seem that the sizes aren't necessarily true to the sizing chart, given that a lot of plus sized girls online find that the XL still fits them well in some leggings. What size should I be considering in these styles? I've also read that sizing can vary depending on the fabric!

* Flex Legging 
* Flex High Waisted Legging
* Vital Seamless Legging
* Adapt Seamless Legging

Thanks for your help!"

I’m 17F and a little above average weight for my height- I don’t think anyone would say I’m obese by any means but I’m definitely above average. I’ve also got a lot of muscle weight (chunkier). 

I’m generally around a Medium in other brands, however using the sizing guide I was in between XL and above- is the sizing generally smaller than other brands or am I reading it wrong? I was especially confused since they have lots of plus-size women models in the picture and then using the guide I can barely fit.

I luckily was able to get in on the restock they had yesterday for the zebra animal print and the blue shark print (hoping and praying they restock the black shark print). 

Anyways, I want more leggings lol but since majority of the Adapt/Breeze Lightweight collection is sold out I started looking at other collections. In comparison to the Adapt collection, how do the Vital/Vital 2.0 measure up?

The main difference I've deduced from YT videos is that the Vital 2.0 have more compression on the waist band and some found it to be uncomfortable. My question is, how compressive are we talking? I love the compression of the Adapt leggings so if Vital 2.0 is similar to that then I have  no problem. However, if it is more compressive then maybe I will go with the OG Vitals...

I wear a size S in all leggings. If I were to purchase the Vital 2.0 I would get a S. If I were to purchase the OG Vitals, I'm wondering if I should stick with a S or size down to an XS to accommodate the gaping waist band. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!"

Sportswear and atheletic gear has really evolved, Nike in particular has been killing it making fucntional products that look great.

Your stuff doesnt look great. It looks very cheap, like using an epson ink jet and hanes blanks cheap. Like worse than a local pop punk bands merch cheap.

And thats just the material, the logos look very generic, nothing pops, nothing memorable, i honestly find nicer t-shirts thrifting from high school plays, charity runs, local breweries, and beer leagues. None of your pieces have cohesive design language. You need to work on those fonts too. There just hasnt been enough thought and effort put into this entire line. I see alot of really dynamic, instagram based, diy, indie as fuck, 1 man shows that are changing the entire game. To me under armour is too cheap and basic id never wear it, but to thsoe that do, why would they pick Gym Shark? You cant compete with those prices and sales and big retailers, so you gotta offer something we cant already get elsewhere, for cheaper and better. 

If you going after the hardcore fitness crowd, remove the heavy branding, focus on material quality and aestetic, that demo doesnt want someones name to look cool, they wanna show off their work. Its the weekend warriors that arent serious that wear those Shirts with huge, aggressive bold text about winning and losers and gains. So you wanna be like Nike if they just sold the shirts that the doucebags wear?

And the womens stuff, yikes, i see better quality on Champions CB discount store sub brand, LuLuLemon is poor quality as well, but at least it looks hot. They are selling sex and its working, no matter how many pictures of ripped tights spread around social media. When Victorias Secret has sales, you can get better quality for a fraction of the price. 

Im sure the success Gym Shark is seeing is the result of algorithims and ai, machine learning, next level social engineerig, this is a masterful use of the power of marketing, but im afraid the results are in, and the product doesnt live up to the hype."

I'm six feet tall and about 165 pounds, which means I'm pretty lanky. Based on the models on the page, their 6 ft guy wore a medium, so that, along with some additional research, was what I ultimately based my decision on since I didn't have a measuring tape and that was my first time buying from Gymshark.

However, I do feel like they are a bit, for lack of a better word, puffy(?), as in there seems to be a bit of extra material around the leg openings. When I do things like squats in them, the openings do seem to slide up my thighs a bit.

Is this how it should be given my height, or should I go a size down? I'm new to this brand so I don't know if that would really solve the issue. I just don't want to look silly with extra fabric around my relatively thin thighs! I also tried to estimate my size measurements and they do seem to match that of a small, despite my height matching that of the guy wearing a medium. 

Any responses or advice would be appreciated. I could always just use the extra material as motivation to beef up my legs too. :)"

I had trouble getting the bottom of the leggings over my heel because it wouldn't stretch much at all. They fit my thighs just fine, but there was a huge gap at the back of my waist. I couldn't imagine working out in them because the material felt so non-stretchy and rubbery.

Anyways, I want more leggings lol but since majority of the Adapt/Breeze Lightweight collection is sold out I started looking at other collections. In comparison to the Adapt collection, how do the Vital/Vital 2.0 measure up?

The main difference I've deduced from YT videos is that the Vital 2.0 have more compression on the waist band and some found it to be uncomfortable. My question is, how compressive are we talking? I love the compression of the Adapt leggings so if Vital 2.0 is similar to that then I have  no problem. However, if it is more compressive then maybe I will go with the OG Vitals...

I wear a size S in all leggings. If I were to purchase the Vital 2.0 I would get a S. If I were to purchase the OG Vitals, I'm wondering if I should stick with a S or size down to an XS to accommodate the gaping waist band. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!"

I want leggings that I can move around in and they stay secure. In 6s and 8s they didnt budge when I jumped and did high knees. The 10 fell.

However I have humongous calves and thighs that I think are mostly fat. So I think size 10 fit my legs best. I even tried on size 10 of the ones with the drawstring but it was still too big on my waist.

My waist is approx 28 inches and I have no butt lol so my hips are approx 39. So according to that measurement a medium in gymshark should fit right?

I keep looking at girls wearing mediums on youtube and they look so tiny compared to me... so I feel like I shouldn't be ordering a medium. But I also don't know if it's all in my head. Idk basically I need help. Should I order a medium or large? I plan on ordering the vital seamless 2.0 because I want the waist band to fit my waist."

The last two products look and feel nice. But their stitching quality is just garbage. The sleeves on the Geo Lightweight came undone and there's a small hole on the body.

The stiches are such poor quality, you can just take it apart using your nails with little effort.

 I've had $10 Walmart t-shirts hold up better than this. The thing is, the last 2 are in the higher price category of their t-shirts.

I’ve tried both, but I’m wondering if anyone with the same measurements has either size. I like the more compression of the S (although more tight to get on), and the waistband feels secure and tight but not too tight. I don’t feel like there is that much stretch left in the S tho when on. The M feels chill, less tight and less compression. The waistband feels good and isn’t tight at all, but I’m worried it’s too loose. I’m afraid it will fall down during training, and doesn’t feel as secure. Glutes look better in M and there’s more stretch to the fabric when on. Thanks!

I bought 2 x pairs of Gymshark Vital Seamless leggings on the 27th November (Black Friday sale). 

I’ve worn each pair to the gym twice as my gym has only just opened due to COVID restrictions and the waiting list etc. I’ve noticed that the logo on one pair has started to peel off. I washed them following the instructions (inside out and I even washed them at 25 degrees on a gentle cycle) and I don’t own a dryer!! so I have only dried them inside on a clothes horse. 

Some photos of the peeling here: https://imgur.com/gallery/iQ70CoK

**ETA, :** I actually ended up ordering an xs for two leggings. I was excited to try them, but they arrived DAMAGED! I have tried contacting CS to no avail. I won't be ordering from Gymshark again.

Hey there.

I just got Gymshark clothes for the first time this Black Friday. In this review I discuss the camo seamless and vital seamless. I do yoga and running primarily and bought these clothes for those sports. In the future, I hope to get back to doing lifts in the gym. **My measurements are 5 ft 8 in, 32D, waist: 27 inch, hips: 39 inch.**

In the *vital seamless, size small, blue marl,* when I do a [squat](https://imgur.com/a/6c7QXdd) you can see that the waistband opens up in the back. It doesn't show my underwear (which is a leggings disaster basically), but it opening up makes me feel exposed. It does pass the 'squat [test](https://imgur.com/a/bDPv4TJ)' in that my underwear isn't showing through. I'm wearing a black thong in the GIF, but when I wore a bright pink thong with the light green camo seamless set, there was no issue.

Now for actual yoga, I have to sadly say the waistband moves more than I want! Going from [down dog](https://imgur.com/a/E5SB95S) to one leg causes the waistband to open. Then to [warrior one](https://imgur.com/a/wqaxUDh) my waistband is all the way down not covering my belly! Then I have to adjust when moving to [warrior two](https://imgur.com/a/Wl6eJwV). Warrior two to [triangle](https://imgur.com/a/V152hM2) is okay. Then when I go through the vinyasa at the end from down dog to [child pose](https://imgur.com/a/ifPHEZE) you see the waistband open up again!

Now that leaves me wondering if I should get a size xs. I like the fit in my butt and thighs, but the waistband moving really annoys me!

**Tldr**: **My measurements are 5 ft 8 in, 32D, waist: 27 inch, hips: 39 inch.** I reviewed the size small in gymshark vital seamless, marl blue, and camo seamless, light green. They have good material and structure. I hate the waistband because it moves around a lot and *could* leave me exposed in some moves. I may try xs in the future."

I decided to post some pics to see if it could help some of the ladies that have questions. I am a size 6 in Lululemon and a medium in Under Armour, Nike and Adidas . I wear a size M in gymshark. My measurements are 27"" waist, 40"" hips /butt, and the biggest parts of my thigh is 25"". I have a muscular build. According to their size chart I am between a small and medium. People would likely reccomend wear a small however that does not work for me. I have tried a small and ripped them pulling them up my thighs. My advice would be stick to what you wear in other brands sizes. If you're a small, get a small if you're a large get a large.  Done size down from your waist side either. Just because they stretch does not mean that it's going to fit. This is what causes their gear to wear out quicker. I use to work for Lululemon so I am pretty familiar with active wear fittings..

1652,Am I the only one disappointed in the Whitney Simmons second collection?,15,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymshark/comments/jrueey/am_i_the_only_one_disappointed_in_the_whitney/,14,2020-11-10 16:47:11,"So putting aside how poor the management of the collection was regarding stocking, purchasing and from what I've heard, shipping as well, I'm honestly pretty disappointed in the lighter coloured leggings. I only managed to get my hands on the blue and red ribbed leggings and gee they are not worth the money they cost me. Wore the blue for the first time today on a relatively light day at the gym, nothing high intensity but I was still sweating. I had visible sweat patches within 5min of warming up. They dry ok, not particularly quickly. 

Holy moly the red. I normally wear a black thong to workout and I could see my underwear from the front when I tried the red on. I understand lighter colours not being completely squat proof but I was just standing there and there was an obvious shadow where my underwear was. I know lighter colours tend not to be as sweat proof or squat proof but I expected better from gymshark ngl. 
 
Holy moly I just wore the shorts for sport and they ride up so badly! I don't think I can even wear them again. I was constantly pulling them down and adjusting them. This collection is finding new ways to disappoint me. 

Anyone else having trouble with the products from this launch??"

My waist is 33' which makes me an XL  
41' in the hips which makes me a S  
75' inside the leg which makes me an XS

Keep in mind that I do have a fair bit of belly fat, which makes waistbands fall down. From Echt I am an XL in everything and both Echt and Gymshark have the exact same size guide so I have been basing my decision on that. I have been opting for a L since it fits perfectly around the hips, but feel as though it would sit better on my waist if I went with an XL (only issue is that leaves me with extra fabric around my hips and legs).

Are the flex shorts as compressive as they look? Could I fit into a L if I wanted to? And can sizes vary according to the different types of fabrics used amongst all the leggings and shorts? Any help would be much appreciated!"

Around that time, they had some really incredible quality clothing from the Ark collection. I bought a nice black sweater from the Ark collection that was sleek and great to wear both casually and at the gym, as well as a pair of shorts that had a back pocket and was awesome for deadlifting in.

I've inquired this question myself to their Customer support team, but they always tell me to keep checking periodically. It's been about 2 years since they've had the Ark Collection. They've recommended the Critical Collection as a close alternative. But their Critical Collection, in my opinion, isn't the greatest quality and their sizing seems entirely off compared to the Ark collection.

For those who have supported the brand for much longer, does Gymshark ever bring back older collections?"

I've been wanting to order Gymshark clothing for quite a while now but am honestly a bit worried about the fit. My hips are 45"" which would suggest I get a L, but my waist is 35"" and the biggest waist size in the chart is 32"" (30"" for a size L).

For reference, I'm generally a size L (10) in Fabletics high compression styles, and I believe I have a pair of Lululemon Wunder Under Luxtreme leggings that are either a size 8 or 10 (I bought them over 6 years ago so I honestly can't remember lol).  I'm usually a size 12 in jeans, but don't wear them often haha.

I've looked up a lot of reviews, and it does seem that the sizes aren't necessarily true to the sizing chart, given that a lot of plus sized girls online find that the XL still fits them well in some leggings. What size should I be considering in these styles? I've also read that sizing can vary depending on the fabric!

* Flex High Waisted Legging
* Vital Seamless Legging

I’m just wondering how you feel about the quality about the products. 

The reason that I’m asking this is because I just received my first order a few days ago (1 shirt, sweater and joggingpants) and the t-shirt already came with a hole in it, so I immediatly contacted support to get this sorted out. 

Today I went to the gym with my Gymshark clothes and before even entering the gym the zipper of my joggingspants came of on one side. (I can’t seem to get it on there again)

Now I’m really in doubt of the quality, especially since it’s the first time ordering here and already 2/3 products are broken. I’m also a bit worried about contacting support again because it seems like I’m complaining too much.

Sportswear and atheletic gear has really evolved, Nike in particular has been killing it making fucntional products that look great.

Your stuff doesnt look great. It looks very cheap, like using an epson ink jet and hanes blanks cheap. Like worse than a local pop punk bands merch cheap.

And thats just the material, the logos look very generic, nothing pops, nothing memorable, i honestly find nicer t-shirts thrifting from high school plays, charity runs, local breweries, and beer leagues. None of your pieces have cohesive design language. You need to work on those fonts too. There just hasnt been enough thought and effort put into this entire line. I see alot of really dynamic, instagram based, diy, indie as fuck, 1 man shows that are changing the entire game. To me under armour is too cheap and basic id never wear it, but to thsoe that do, why would they pick Gym Shark? You cant compete with those prices and sales and big retailers, so you gotta offer something we cant already get elsewhere, for cheaper and better. 

If you going after the hardcore fitness crowd, remove the heavy branding, focus on material quality and aestetic, that demo doesnt want someones name to look cool, they wanna show off their work. Its the weekend warriors that arent serious that wear those Shirts with huge, aggressive bold text about winning and losers and gains. So you wanna be like Nike if they just sold the shirts that the doucebags wear?

And the womens stuff, yikes, i see better quality on Champions CB discount store sub brand, LuLuLemon is poor quality as well, but at least it looks hot. They are selling sex and its working, no matter how many pictures of ripped tights spread around social media. When Victorias Secret has sales, you can get better quality for a fraction of the price. 

Im sure the success Gym Shark is seeing is the result of algorithims and ai, machine learning, next level social engineerig, this is a masterful use of the power of marketing, but im afraid the results are in, and the product doesnt live up to the hype."

The edges of the fabric that run along the edges of the arm holes seem to have curled in towards the body, shrinking the dimension of this top across the chest.

i was so sus about the whole thing bc one of my other packages had arrived open and i kind of just brushed it off.

anyway, i decided to get in contact with FedEx customer service and they said they would search for the package, but later when i called for an update- the man i was speaking to literally told me a lot of gymshark packages that end up going missing usually aren’t found, and that there’s been instances where packages arrive to customers empty (i’ve heard of that happening). he basically told me i should expect a call in a few days if my package is or isn’t located and then i can talk to gymshark about it.

I'm looking to buy some tank tops, a few t shirts (for workout purposes) and a hoodie if possible (not necessarily to wear in the gym, the critical hoodie range is calling my name). How do the clothes fit? Is there a certain range I should opt for? Should I go for a size up in the hoodie?"

I’m 5’1 120lbs & 34C & wear a size 4 in lululemon as well for reference. I bought the camo seamless leggings in a small & sports bra in a medium. I don’t think they’re too tight or too loose, but I’m wondering if I should have sized down on both the leggings and sports bra for better support and compression. I want to buy more from the brand & was wondering what my perfect size from them would be? Thanks!"

Female.
Waist = 31” (I have belly fat)
Hips = 42”
Height = 5’3” (I know they’ll be long on me)


The pair I’m looking at is the Camo Seamless in black but according to their size chart my waist is between an L and an XL which makes sense but my hips put me between a S and an M. There’s no way I’m an S but should I be sizing these leggings to my hips or to my waist?

I recently received my second ever order from Gymshark. I had ordered the Camo leggings as well as the Energy+ Seamless leggings, both size M. The Camo leggings fit perfectly, but when i tried on the Energy leggings, they were super loose in the ankle.

I’m hoping it’s just a manufacturer error, but essentially the width of the calf on these leggings is the same as the ankle, meaning they fall straight down instead of hugging tight to the leg. I am going to return them, however i’m worried about ordering another pair and having the same issue. They fit perfectly everywhere else on me!

Anyone have a similar problem?"

critical hoodie- absolutely perfect 

critical t shirts were iffy bc they were a little too tight maybe a large but i feel like once i lose some weight from my belly they’ll fit better

critical joggers- loose on the thighs and a slimmer fit on the calves. *i have yam like calves but they fit like a glove*

Between orders being cancelled, extremely delayed shipping, carts disappearing, stock running out in less than five minutes, and awful social media canned responses? 

&#x200B;

It feels like those of us who wanted to spend the most money were the ones who ended up being punished. I spent a good ten minutes adding about $600 bucks worth of stuff in my cart, only for it to all sell out and be removed from my cart (literally - all of it). Against my better judgement, I did another order that was about $300...that's now sitting, still waiting to be fulfilled. 

&#x200B;

Do you think they can recover? I know that I'll never order from them again. There are so many alternatives that fit right into the same price point and quality standards...."
