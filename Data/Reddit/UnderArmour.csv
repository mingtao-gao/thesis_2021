I would love to have some help identifying a technical hoodie I tried in a shop. Unfortunately the last remaining size in the shop (a reseller) was too small, and the identification tag was removed due to being a returned Xmas present. In a moment of stupidity I didn‚Äôt take a photo.

The hoodie was of a more technical line, quite thin (e.g. for running) and had a full zip and a hood. Notably it had a pattern of concentric circles in the material on the back, starting near the neck and growing bigger down the back.

The colour was a stony green/grey. Price was around 70‚Ç¨.

I have looked on the UnderArmour website but was not able to find it.

Any help would be much appreciated!!"

My husband got me one of the Recovery hoodies recently. He thought it would be great for me since I‚Äôm always cold. The problem is that the lining is ridiculously itchy, pulls at my arm hairs and generally invokes the feeling of eating chalk.

This is my first time buying UA compression leggings (see link below). I live in Southern Ontario and plan to use them for my runs in the winter. I am currently using 2XU compression tights and they've been an essential in helping me with my knee pain (knocked knees). 2XU thermal's tights are really expensive and I am already finding myself wanting some warmth when I run in my regular 2XU tights.

To anyone who has used ColdGear compression tights, how warm and durable are they? Specifically if someone can comment on how much compression they actually offer since there are no mmHg measurements. also are there are any other options I should consider?

Thanks a ton in advance :)

I bought a new one on July this year because it was on sale; and exactly 33 days and 2 washes the leg seam (is that what its called) near the knee where there is pressure from the thigh became unstuck and the inner threads started pulling. There is now a hole and so i stopped using it.

Went to the only distributor in my country and they declined to replace it because it was ""already used"". So bummed out right now. Never going to buy anything from that place again and might also think twice on any UA purchase.

i bought a sportstyle jogger along with it and so far it is doing well."
125,General discussion of UA product quality decline,7,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderArmour/comments/j0vvj3/general_discussion_of_ua_product_quality_decline/,4,2020-09-27 14:15:54,"I've been a loyal buyer of UA products (mainly shorts, shirts, underwear, and compression shorts) since the mid-2000's and have noticed that sometime in the last several years (2012-ish if I had to give a specific year), the quality of their products has taken a noticeable decline.  Some specific examples include:

* thinner fabrics (almost to the point of being see-through depending on the color and product)
* lower-quality stiching that comes undone
* elimination of elastane from products that used to contain it (the basic UA tech T being the primary example of this; for a period of time elastane was also removed from their training shorts but it seems to have since been added back)
* weaker elastic bands on shorts and underwear
* inconsistent fit and sizing depending on country of manufacture

Product reviews on their own website from people who been customers long enough to notice this trend express similar opinions.

I've also noticed that the fit of some of their products seems to have been changed to favor a less athletic build (i.e. boxer jocks with narrow leg openings but an oversized waistband) but that's separate from the quality of materials used.

Have any other long-time UA buyers noticed this?  Back in the 2000's I would have described UA as a premium brand in terms of product quality relative to other sports apparel companies but it seems at some point they decided to primarily target the budget segment.  If they decided to release a new line called ""UA Premium"" that was equivalent in quality to their earliest generation of clothing I would be annoyed by the marketing spin but would grudgingly buy the products.  

As it stands I'm searching for alternatives to UA but so far the only athletic apparel brand I know of that clearly markets itself as ""premium"" is lululemon.  I think it's better to buy a quality product once rather than multiple lower-quality products that wear out over the same time period, but I'm not sure if that's an option anymore."

New to this subreddit but glad it's here. I've recently gotten back into running and I wanted a cheap band that allowed me to check my heart rate and most specifically, the distance I've completed so far during a run (so I know how much further I need to go instead of looking at Strava on my phone for example). Also, I think I saw a review of the UA scale where they were able to show body fat percentage.

I dont really need it to auto sync or anything but I was more interested in whether the features were still usable offline despite UA Record being taken out of commission. Does anyone currently have these products and find them working for these features? Health boxes are pretty cheap to pick up now that UA Record no longer has support so I was thinking of buying -- super contingent on the distance tracking and weight stats working offline before I shell out though.

Any feedback is appreciated!"

I've been looking at a couple of pairs of Under Armour shoes.  Namely, the Pursuit 2, Assert 8, and Escape 3.

I'm not a runner, but I do sometimes use the elliptical, and go for walks.  More of an all-purpose shoe than a marathon runner, in other words. :)

Does anyone have any experience or opinions about these?  With lockdown, I can't really try on, so I need to guidance on the decision.

Thanks!"

They said my account ""looked suspicious"". I have had my account since 2016 and both cards were purchased BRAND NEW legitimately by me. From GYFT.com and from BITPAY.

I spoke with a supervisor namedSteve W. (He refused to give me his last name)

He told me I would not be getting a refund nor an explanation about why UnderArmour took my balance off both cards.

BOTH CARDS WERE PURCHASED LEGITIMATELY.

And the companies I purchased them from does not sell USED gift cards their gift cards are brand new issued electronically.

Steve W. kept saying I had 3 orders shipped out of state but I only see one order in my account that was a gift.

Why put the option to purchase gifts on your website if it will be flagged as fraudulent.

The more I questioned Steve W. about the gift cards it was clear he could not give me a straight answer as to why my card balance was taken away. 

There has never been a problem with my account or the gift cards I used. 

He told me to get a refund from the companies I purchased them from but they will not refund me now because the balance is $0 and the card number and pin have been exposed already.

How can your company just take my money without any good reason and keep it? I am not a scammer I have been a customer for years and like I said Purchased them legitimately BRAND NEW.

Oh and the total cost of the order in case your wondering $31.97 including tax   SMH"

The order totaled about $330. I kept one item, requested another be exchanged for a bigger size and returned the rest of the items that I didn't want. I've called UA tons of times because they messed up the exchange request and didn't refund my order. The email that I received about my order refund showed the items that were refunded however, the price I paid was crossed out and a lesser price was written next to the item so, my refund was substantially less than what I paid.   


I've even called corporate to determine if I could escalate this issue. I got hung up on the first time, the second time I asked to speak to someone in the billing department and was transferred to the team that had previously failed to address this issue. The third time I called back I was not transferred to billing and was told ""sometimes what you pay for an item won't be the amount you're refunded."" UM what?! I literally requested a refund not even three days after receiving the package. The items haven't been discontinued or anything. UA just literally is not refunding my money. The last person I spoke with took my name/email and said she would forward the information to someone and I should hear back via email. Of course I never heard anything.   


Really not sure what I should do at this point since every UA rep i've spoken to either hangs up, doesn't address the problem or flat-out contends that I shouldn't get my money back. This is genuinely appalling conduct. I'm contemplating just contacting my bank and requesting a chargeback for the balance owed."

It's quite possibly the most obsessed I have been with a shoe ever and couldn't wait to get hold of a pair (or two). Being a big guy and playing at a high level the Hovr cushion seems to suit my needs perfectly and who doesn't love a perfect herringbone tread pattern.

Finally news surfaced that It was going to be released on the 31st of October as a Halloween colourway and I would at last be able to get my hands on them. So Halloween comes and I am checking the UA site throughout the day waiting for them to pop up but to no avail, even after seeing release reminders on other sites. 

Then I discover that they have only been released in the US so far. I live in the UK so obviously this poses a problem. I emailed customer services asking if they knew when or if the orange model would release in the UK/ Europe and they said they don't know when or if it will but I can use the borderfree ordering to order them from the US site.

There was hope. I pull up the US site and go to order, even with it looking like it was going to cost 50%+ more with the shipping and taxes and duties. And It's sold out of my size (UK12/ US13) which was the only size that was sold out at that point i think, just my luck!

So I'm lost, I don't know what to do and I might just be completely out of luck and never be able to get my hands on them. I'm not really sure what I'm posting for but just wanted to vent my frustration and disappointment somewhere and hope that maybe someone else might know where i can get hold of them or if there is any more information about further releases or anything of the sort. 

Anyway, thanks for reading!

I heard UnderArmour makes compression clothing that can conceal loose skin under clothing, and so it from flapping around. 

I guess I'm fortunate that I never got big ""moobs"", so I don't have a lot of loose chest skin (although my entire skin-suit seems to have sagged a little), but my abdomen/ lower-waist is a saggy mess of loose skin. I'd really like to find under shirts/under clothes that compress my loose skin so my body looks better in nice, properly fitting shirts, etc. As of now I'm still wearing clothes that are too big and loose, just like I did when i was 305 lbs. I finally tried on some nice, properly fitting clothes, and that's what I want to wear. 

I worked really hard to lose weight without any medical intervention. I thought doing it slowly (a pound a week for 2 years) would make my skin shrink with me, but it didn't work out that way. I think it did reduce the severity of my loose skin, but it's still bothersome. 

I currently tuck my stomach skin into my boxers, otherwise it would hang over my belt line. I also have loose skin on my inner thighs. My thigh skin isn't visible when I'm wearing pants, but it does bother me when I'm working out, so I would like to buy a product to control it if possible. My stomach skin also bothers me I'm while working out, it makes a ""slapping"" sound and is embarrassing. And the way my loose skin looks look bothers me while I'm wearing my workout gear, but most of all when I'm simply trying to wear presentable, nice clothing. 

Does UnderArmour make something that could help me with my specifically explained issues? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone could tell me what items would help me. I looked online, but I don't understand the differences in products. I do want something that is breathable though and will help me stay cool.

They are more similar to plain spandex than anything I've been able to find on the shelves recently. They are super stretchy and extremely sleek/slick feeling. Super smooth and extremely comfortable. Sort of a slippery feel to them.

They have a very thin seem (not super reinforced) and a pretty thin elastic waist band (not the thick, extra wide ones they have now).

I absolutely love these capris but I just can't find them anywhere. I'm wondering if anyone knows a place that would sell super old UA products (no luck with eBay so far) OR someone knows a similar product that's from a good quality brand. 

Thank you."

Later Monday, however, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank joined Frazier in leaving the council. The sporting goods CEO said he decided to do so because his company ""engages in innovation and sports, not politics.""  Business Insider 8/15/2017

A prominent CEO has an opportunity to influence and affect US manufacturing while being a significant player on the POTUS‚Äôs manufacturing council but instead pussys out.  He does so due to political pressure while reasoning it‚Äôs actually not politics.  Grow some balls, Kevin Plank!  Invest in US manufacturing, Kevin.  Improve the US workforce outlook for your neighbors, Kevin.  C‚Äômon, seriously.  I understand you want to protect your brand and are afraid of alienating some customers so just say it.  Don‚Äôt speak out of both sides of your mouth.  I‚Äôm a customer and I‚Äôm sick of buying from companies that don‚Äôt value American workers and American manufacturing.  Here‚Äôs how I see it.

Under Armour's Comment on Supply Chain
Approximately 50% to 55% of the fabric used in our products came from six suppliers. These fabric suppliers have primary locations in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan and Vietnam. We strengthened our relations with key strategic suppliers while also continuing to seek new suppliers to diversify our source base. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. CHARGED COTTON¬Æ products that we introduced in 2011 continue to perform strongly in the market. This product primarily uses cotton fabrics that may also be subject to commodity price fluctuations and shortages.
Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers and, fourteen manufacturers produced approximately 65% of our products, with primary locations in Jordan, Philippines, China, Nicaragua. Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. Our products were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries, with approximately 66% of our products manufactured in Asia, 14% in Central and South America, 15% in the Middle East and 5% in Mexico. All manufacturers are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our quality assurance team prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. Where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. We also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. We enter into a variety of agreements with our manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and working conditions and other social concerns. We do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. We have a subsidiary in Hong Kong to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for apparel and a subsidiary in
Guangzhou, China to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for footwear and accessories. We also manufacture a limited number of apparel products, primarily for high-profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop located at one of our distribution facilities in Maryland.

Have no idea about Under Armour other than  with the understanding is that it is good quality stuff.

I was walking around a store today and I was surprised to find out that there are shirts for different things. Obviously I wouldn't be wearing a golf shirt to jog but I was a little more confused as to the purpose of compression fabric vs loose fitting shirts, or their t-shirts.

Can anyone help explain the differences between compression shirts, t shirts and the shirts with like air flow or cool flow or whatnot? I have no idea what each style does or its purpose and would like some clarification before investing in the wrong type of stuff."

I try to do a 1-3 hour walk at least twice a week, however i can never be 100% sure as some days see me so busy i get very little free time, my walk for the most part is somewhat fast(usually i walk to the beat of whatever song i'm listening to, if the song has a bpm of 300, then i try to walk at the same pace as the beat of the song)
I do very little running(i get exhausted way too fast, i can barely run 250m(820.21 feet)before i have to stop and catch my breath, or maybe less than that, either way i don't do much running, and i love cycling, but at the time of writing this, i have no bike(i do plan to get one though), And i do want gel padding(or whatever Under Armours version of Gel Padding is)so with that info, what footwear would be perfect for me(im size 10.5 Australia or 11 America)"

He brought a really nice picture for him. Was excited all day.. even standing in line and banging on the windows... even then still excited. but they never let him. It's sad. He worked hard, had a plan got there early, got the band, bought the shoes and now total disappointment.

My advise was to return the shoes and not buy Under Armour again. I dont know much about these signings, and clearly there is a loophole. The whole things was disorganized. He feels he did everything that was asked of him in order to meet his favorite player. And is totally let down."

When I tried to research them I couldn't find any info for this store and i would like to warn others about it.

Long story short:
The store says it operates from Canada, but ships cheap ripoffs from Hongkong. The prices aren't too crazy for an outlet so i gave it a try and man... they aren't even trying to make the ripoffs look like legit stuff.

So... Up/Down votes don't matter on this post, since all i want to create is something that will pop up whenever somebody tries to google www.canadaunderarmouroutlet.com 

I hope this works...

Some specific examples include:

* thinner fabrics (almost to the point of being see-through depending on the color and product)
* lower-quality stiching that comes undone
* elimination of elastane from products that used to contain it (the basic UA tech T being the primary example of this; for a period of time elastane was also removed from their training shorts but it seems to have since been added back)
* weaker elastic bands on shorts and underwear
* inconsistent fit and sizing depending on country of manufacture

Product reviews on their own website from people who been customers long enough to notice this trend express similar opinions.

I've also noticed that the fit of some of their products seems to have been changed to favor a less athletic build (i.e. boxer jocks with narrow leg openings but an oversized waistband) but that's separate from the quality of materials used.

Have any other long-time UA buyers noticed this?  Back in the 2000's I would have described UA as a premium brand in terms of product quality relative to other sports apparel companies but it seems at some point they decided to primarily target the budget segment.  If they decided to release a new line called ""UA Premium"" that was equivalent in quality to their earliest generation of clothing I would be annoyed by the marketing spin but would grudgingly buy the products.  

As it stands I'm searching for alternatives to UA but so far the only athletic apparel brand I know of that clearly markets itself as ""premium"" is lululemon.  I think it's better to buy a quality product once rather than multiple lower-quality products that wear out over the same time period, but I'm not sure if that's an option anymore."

I got this Under Armour sweatshirt around 2017, but have since lost it. I believe that it was an Under Armour Storm sweatshirt. It was water resistant with a bit of a fleece lining inside. I haven't been able to find this sweatshirt anywhere. If anyone knows if it's been discontinued, are there any similar sweatshirts that UA makes now? Thanks!

808,New to UnderArmour... I really need advice on what shirt to buy,3,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderArmour/comments/9j8rr7/new_to_underarmour_i_really_need_advice_on_what/,1,2018-09-26 21:58:29,"I went from 305 lbs to 195 lbs and I have loose skin. I heard UnderArmour makes compression clothing that can conceal loose skin under clothing, and so it from flapping around. 

I guess I'm fortunate that I never got big ""moobs"", so I don't have a lot of loose chest skin (although my entire skin-suit seems to have sagged a little), but my abdomen/ lower-waist is a saggy mess of loose skin. I'd really like to find under shirts/under clothes that compress my loose skin so my body looks better in nice, properly fitting shirts, etc. As of now I'm still wearing clothes that are too big and loose, just like I did when i was 305 lbs. I finally tried on some nice, properly fitting clothes, and that's what I want to wear. 

I worked really hard to lose weight without any medical intervention. I thought doing it slowly (a pound a week for 2 years) would make my skin shrink with me, but it didn't work out that way. I think it did reduce the severity of my loose skin, but it's still bothersome. 

I currently tuck my stomach skin into my boxers, otherwise it would hang over my belt line. I also have loose skin on my inner thighs. My thigh skin isn't visible when I'm wearing pants, but it does bother me when I'm working out, so I would like to buy a product to control it if possible. My stomach skin also bothers me I'm while working out, it makes a ""slapping"" sound and is embarrassing. And the way my loose skin looks look bothers me while I'm wearing my workout gear, but most of all when I'm simply trying to wear presentable, nice clothing. 

Does UnderArmour make something that could help me with my specifically explained issues? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone could tell me what items would help me. I looked online, but I don't understand the differences in products. I do want something that is breathable though and will help me stay cool. 

Thank you. "

I try to do a 1-3 hour walk at least twice a week, however i can never be 100% sure as some days see me so busy i get very little free time, my walk for the most part is somewhat fast(usually i walk to the beat of whatever song i'm listening to, if the song has a bpm of 300, then i try to walk at the same pace as the beat of the song)
I do very little running(i get exhausted way too fast, i can barely run 250m(820.21 feet)before i have to stop and catch my breath, or maybe less than that, either way i don't do much running, and i love cycling, but at the time of writing this, i have no bike(i do plan to get one though), And i do want gel padding(or whatever Under Armours version of Gel Padding is)so with that info, what footwear would be perfect for me(im size 10.5 Australia or 11 America)"

The store says it operates from Canada, but ships cheap ripoffs from Hongkong. The prices aren't too crazy for an outlet so i gave it a try and man... they aren't even trying to make the ripoffs look like legit stuff.

Usually i would take the one that fits my face more snug but how breathable these masks are has me wondering if they're suppose to fit a bit baggy like the XXL.

New to this subreddit but glad it's here. I've recently gotten back into running and I wanted a cheap band that allowed me to check my heart rate and most specifically, the distance I've completed so far during a run (so I know how much further I need to go instead of looking at Strava on my phone for example). Also, I think I saw a review of the UA scale where they were able to show body fat percentage.

I dont really need it to auto sync or anything but I was more interested in whether the features were still usable offline despite UA Record being taken out of commission. Does anyone currently have these products and find them working for these features? Health boxes are pretty cheap to pick up now that UA Record no longer has support so I was thinking of buying -- super contingent on the distance tracking and weight stats working offline before I shell out though.

Any feedback is appreciated!"

They are more similar to plain spandex than anything I've been able to find on the shelves recently. They are super stretchy and extremely sleek/slick feeling. Super smooth and extremely comfortable. Sort of a slippery feel to them.

They have a very thin seem (not super reinforced) and a pretty thin elastic waist band (not the thick, extra wide ones they have now).

I absolutely love these capris but I just can't find them anywhere. I'm wondering if anyone knows a place that would sell super old UA products (no luck with eBay so far) OR someone knows a similar product that's from a good quality brand. 

Thank you."

At least 6 of my running mates have recently bought new 2E models and we're spreading the news as far and as wide as we can.

Adidas and Nike have hardly anything in different widths. Asics only have a couple of (heavy motion control) choices. Under Armour has actually addressed those of us who have been waiting for a lighter, more flexible option that fit us properly. Thank you from the bottoms of our wide gorilla feet UnderArmour!.

Since the Curry 2s were good for me, I was wondering if the Curry 2.5s would be better.

The order totaled about $330. I kept one item, requested another be exchanged for a bigger size and returned the rest of the items that I didn't want. I've called UA tons of times because they messed up the exchange request and didn't refund my order. The email that I received about my order refund showed the items that were refunded however, the price I paid was crossed out and a lesser price was written next to the item so, my refund was substantially less than what I paid.   


I've even called corporate to determine if I could escalate this issue. I got hung up on the first time, the second time I asked to speak to someone in the billing department and was transferred to the team that had previously failed to address this issue. The third time I called back I was not transferred to billing and was told ""sometimes what you pay for an item won't be the amount you're refunded."" UM what?! I literally requested a refund not even three days after receiving the package. The items haven't been discontinued or anything. UA just literally is not refunding my money. The last person I spoke with took my name/email and said she would forward the information to someone and I should hear back via email. Of course I never heard anything.   


Really not sure what I should do at this point since every UA rep i've spoken to either hangs up, doesn't address the problem or flat-out contends that I shouldn't get my money back. This is genuinely appalling conduct. I'm contemplating just contacting my bank and requesting a chargeback for the balance owed."

Started to workout seriously bout a month and also bought some phantoms which im also enjoying, but my question is about the apps.

&#x200B;

Is it me or the UI not really friendly, like i use the app on my apple watch to get the heart rate and all that other good info but when i look at the workouts on my phone to get in depth info its just seems like clutter to me. Even when i run and the info syncs it looks alot better than a regular workout. 

&#x200B;

are the maymy apps better than other apps to track workouts, do you guys use it, or something else, i used to use the NRC app and liked it, but really trying to use this mvp feature thoroughly. Any apple watch users just use the regular workout apps to track, what do you like about the map my apps or others...i just want somethign consistant to track progress and keep my motivation up"

It's quite possibly the most obsessed I have been with a shoe ever and couldn't wait to get hold of a pair (or two). Being a big guy and playing at a high level the Hovr cushion seems to suit my needs perfectly and who doesn't love a perfect herringbone tread pattern.

Finally news surfaced that It was going to be released on the 31st of October as a Halloween colourway and I would at last be able to get my hands on them. So Halloween comes and I am checking the UA site throughout the day waiting for them to pop up but to no avail, even after seeing release reminders on other sites. 

Then I discover that they have only been released in the US so far. I live in the UK so obviously this poses a problem. I emailed customer services asking if they knew when or if the orange model would release in the UK/ Europe and they said they don't know when or if it will but I can use the borderfree ordering to order them from the US site.

There was hope. I pull up the US site and go to order, even with it looking like it was going to cost 50%+ more with the shipping and taxes and duties. And It's sold out of my size (UK12/ US13) which was the only size that was sold out at that point i think, just my luck!

So I'm lost, I don't know what to do and I might just be completely out of luck and never be able to get my hands on them. I'm not really sure what I'm posting for but just wanted to vent my frustration and disappointment somewhere and hope that maybe someone else might know where i can get hold of them or if there is any more information about further releases or anything of the sort. 

Anyway, thanks for reading!

Can somebody of you recommend good ones? Does anybody here have experiences with them? Don't want to buy a next flop, thanks for help i appreciat!"

I want to stick with under armour and have no need to get another brand since I'm told they are very reliable. Any help you guys can give would be great. Thank you"

I would love to have some help identifying a technical hoodie I tried in a shop. Unfortunately the last remaining size in the shop (a reseller) was too small, and the identification tag was removed due to being a returned Xmas present. In a moment of stupidity I didn‚Äôt take a photo.

The hoodie was of a more technical line, quite thin (e.g. for running) and had a full zip and a hood. Notably it had a pattern of concentric circles in the material on the back, starting near the neck and growing bigger down the back.

The colour was a stony green/grey. Price was around 70‚Ç¨.

I have looked on the UnderArmour website but was not able to find it.

Any help would be much appreciated!!"

It came out much softer than before, though not as soft as plain fleece would be, obviously. But I can wear it over a tank top and be comfortable! And I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll only get softer with subsequent washes.

‚Äî

My husband got me one of the Recovery hoodies recently. He thought it would be great for me since I‚Äôm always cold. The problem is that the lining is ridiculously itchy, pulls at my arm hairs and generally invokes the feeling of eating chalk. 

I can‚Äôt find any reviews of this particular hoodie to see if anyone had a similar complaint or if it resolves when you wash it. We‚Äôd like to be able to return it if it turns out that washing does nothing to soften the lining, so we can‚Äôt test it ourselves.

Anyone here have a similar experience? Does it get softer inside with washing?"

This is my first time buying UA compression leggings (see link below). I live in Southern Ontario and plan to use them for my runs in the winter. I am currently using 2XU compression tights and they've been an essential in helping me with my knee pain (knocked knees). 2XU thermal's tights are really expensive and I am already finding myself wanting some warmth when I run in my regular 2XU tights.

To anyone who has used ColdGear compression tights, how warm and durable are they? Specifically if someone can comment on how much compression they actually offer since there are no mmHg measurements. also are there are any other options I should consider?

Thanks a ton in advance :)

It says they're HeatGear Loose fit shorts. I don't know if they're discontinued, but I can't find them on the UA site. And I don't think they can be that old as I see people wearing them from time to time.

Later Monday, however, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank joined Frazier in leaving the council. The sporting goods CEO said he decided to do so because his company ""engages in innovation and sports, not politics.""  Business Insider 8/15/2017

A prominent CEO has an opportunity to influence and affect US manufacturing while being a significant player on the POTUS‚Äôs manufacturing council but instead pussys out.  He does so due to political pressure while reasoning it‚Äôs actually not politics.  Grow some balls, Kevin Plank!  Invest in US manufacturing, Kevin.  Improve the US workforce outlook for your neighbors, Kevin.  C‚Äômon, seriously.  I understand you want to protect your brand and are afraid of alienating some customers so just say it.  Don‚Äôt speak out of both sides of your mouth.  I‚Äôm a customer and I‚Äôm sick of buying from companies that don‚Äôt value American workers and American manufacturing.  Here‚Äôs how I see it.  You really are barely an American company and you passed on an opportunity to influence change and bowed to outside pressures.

Under Armour's Comment on Supply Chain
Approximately 50% to 55% of the fabric used in our products came from six suppliers. These fabric suppliers have primary locations in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan and Vietnam. We strengthened our relations with key strategic suppliers while also continuing to seek new suppliers to diversify our source base. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. CHARGED COTTON¬Æ products that we introduced in 2011 continue to perform strongly in the market. This product primarily uses cotton fabrics that may also be subject to commodity price fluctuations and shortages.
Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers and, fourteen manufacturers produced approximately 65% of our products, with primary locations in Jordan, Philippines, China, Nicaragua. Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. Our products were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries, with approximately 66% of our products manufactured in Asia, 14% in Central and South America, 15% in the Middle East and 5% in Mexico. All manufacturers are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our quality assurance team prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. Where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. We also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. We enter into a variety of agreements with our manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and working conditions and other social concerns. We do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. We have a subsidiary in Hong Kong to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for apparel and a subsidiary in
Guangzhou, China to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for footwear and accessories. We also manufacture a limited number of apparel products, primarily for high-profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop located at one of our distribution facilities in Maryland.

They said my account ""looked suspicious"". I have had my account since 2016 and both cards were purchased BRAND NEW legitimately by me. From GYFT.com and from BITPAY.

I spoke with a supervisor namedSteve W. (He refused to give me his last name)

He told me I would not be getting a refund nor an explanation about why UnderArmour took my balance off both cards.

BOTH CARDS WERE PURCHASED LEGITIMATELY.

And the companies I purchased them from does not sell USED gift cards their gift cards are brand new issued electronically.

Steve W. kept saying I had 3 orders shipped out of state but I only see one order in my account that was a gift.

Why put the option to purchase gifts on your website if it will be flagged as fraudulent.

The more I questioned Steve W. about the gift cards it was clear he could not give me a straight answer as to why my card balance was taken away. 

There has never been a problem with my account or the gift cards I used. 

He told me to get a refund from the companies I purchased them from but they will not refund me now because the balance is $0 and the card number and pin have been exposed already.

How can your company just take my money without any good reason and keep it? I am not a scammer I have been a customer for years and like I said Purchased them legitimately BRAND NEW.

Oh and the total cost of the order in case your wondering $31.97 including tax   SMH"

The hoodie was of a more technical line, quite thin (e.g. for running) and had a full zip and a hood. Notably it had a pattern of concentric circles in the material on the back, starting near the neck and growing bigger down the back.

The colour was a stony green/grey. Price was around 70‚Ç¨.

This is my first time buying UA compression leggings (see link below). I live in Southern Ontario and plan to use them for my runs in the winter. I am currently using 2XU compression tights and they've been an essential in helping me with my knee pain (knocked knees). 2XU thermal's tights are really expensive and I am already finding myself wanting some warmth when I run in my regular 2XU tights.

To anyone who has used ColdGear compression tights, how warm and durable are they? Specifically if someone can comment on how much compression they actually offer since there are no mmHg measurements. also are there are any other options I should consider?

Thanks a ton in advance :)

1482,General discussion of UA product quality decline,7,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderArmour/comments/j0vvj3/general_discussion_of_ua_product_quality_decline/,4,2020-09-27 14:15:54,"I've been a loyal buyer of UA products (mainly shorts, shirts, underwear, and compression shorts) since the mid-2000's and have noticed that sometime in the last several years (2012-ish if I had to give a specific year), the quality of their products has taken a noticeable decline.  Some specific examples include:

* thinner fabrics (almost to the point of being see-through depending on the color and product)
* lower-quality stiching that comes undone
* elimination of elastane from products that used to contain it (the basic UA tech T being the primary example of this; for a period of time elastane was also removed from their training shorts but it seems to have since been added back)
* weaker elastic bands on shorts and underwear
* inconsistent fit and sizing depending on country of manufacture

Product reviews on their own website from people who been customers long enough to notice this trend express similar opinions.

I've also noticed that the fit of some of their products seems to have been changed to favor a less athletic build (i.e. boxer jocks with narrow leg openings but an oversized waistband) but that's separate from the quality of materials used.

Have any other long-time UA buyers noticed this?  Back in the 2000's I would have described UA as a premium brand in terms of product quality relative to other sports apparel companies but it seems at some point they decided to primarily target the budget segment.  If they decided to release a new line called ""UA Premium"" that was equivalent in quality to their earliest generation of clothing I would be annoyed by the marketing spin but would grudgingly buy the products.  

As it stands I'm searching for alternatives to UA but so far the only athletic apparel brand I know of that clearly markets itself as ""premium"" is lululemon.  I think it's better to buy a quality product once rather than multiple lower-quality products that wear out over the same time period, but I'm not sure if that's an option anymore."

Went to the only distributor in my country and they declined to replace it because it was ""already used"". So bummed out right now. Never going to buy anything from that place again and might also think twice on any UA purchase.

i bought a sportstyle jogger along with it and so far it is doing well."

Also, I think I saw a review of the UA scale where they were able to show body fat percentage.

I dont really need it to auto sync or anything but I was more interested in whether the features were still usable offline despite UA Record being taken out of commission. Does anyone currently have these products and find them working for these features? Health boxes are pretty cheap to pick up now that UA Record no longer has support so I was thinking of buying -- super contingent on the distance tracking and weight stats working offline before I shell out though.

Any feedback is appreciated!"

i like the UA of 5+ years ago where the shorts were thicker material, more heavy duty, you could actually feel them on your body, and the fabric didnt pill/fray if  you looked at it wrong.  Still have those shorts by the way.

I spoke with a supervisor namedSteve W. (He refused to give me his last name)

He told me I would not be getting a refund nor an explanation about why UnderArmour took my balance off both cards.

BOTH CARDS WERE PURCHASED LEGITIMATELY.

And the companies I purchased them from does not sell USED gift cards their gift cards are brand new issued electronically.

Steve W. kept saying I had 3 orders shipped out of state but I only see one order in my account that was a gift.

Why put the option to purchase gifts on your website if it will be flagged as fraudulent.

The more I questioned Steve W. about the gift cards it was clear he could not give me a straight answer as to why my card balance was taken away. 

There has never been a problem with my account or the gift cards I used. 

He told me to get a refund from the companies I purchased them from but they will not refund me now because the balance is $0 and the card number and pin have been exposed already.

How can your company just take my money without any good reason and keep it? I am not a scammer I have been a customer for years and like I said Purchased them legitimately BRAND NEW.

 It's my favorite ""swacket"" to wear anytime when it's freezing just to go run errands or whatever. It's getting really old now and starting to fray so I'm looking into what to replace it with. I am ""bigger"" so to speak and I liked this jacket at XXL but I could do XXXL. Any recommendations on something similar to this? The modern Swackets don't seem to have a front chest zip pocket and a shiny material on the sleeves/hood which I don't care for."

The order totaled about $330. I kept one item, requested another be exchanged for a bigger size and returned the rest of the items that I didn't want. I've called UA tons of times because they messed up the exchange request and didn't refund my order. The email that I received about my order refund showed the items that were refunded however, the price I paid was crossed out and a lesser price was written next to the item so, my refund was substantially less than what I paid.   


I've even called corporate to determine if I could escalate this issue. I got hung up on the first time, the second time I asked to speak to someone in the billing department and was transferred to the team that had previously failed to address this issue. The third time I called back I was not transferred to billing and was told ""sometimes what you pay for an item won't be the amount you're refunded."" UM what?! I literally requested a refund not even three days after receiving the package. The items haven't been discontinued or anything. UA just literally is not refunding my money. The last person I spoke with took my name/email and said she would forward the information to someone and I should hear back via email. Of course I never heard anything.   


Really not sure what I should do at this point since every UA rep i've spoken to either hangs up, doesn't address the problem or flat-out contends that I shouldn't get my money back. This is genuinely appalling conduct. I'm contemplating just contacting my bank and requesting a chargeback for the balance owed."

Started to workout seriously bout a month and also bought some phantoms which im also enjoying, but my question is about the apps.

&#x200B;

Is it me or the UI not really friendly, like i use the app on my apple watch to get the heart rate and all that other good info but when i look at the workouts on my phone to get in depth info its just seems like clutter to me. Even when i run and the info syncs it looks alot better than a regular workout. 

&#x200B;

are the maymy apps better than other apps to track workouts, do you guys use it, or something else, i used to use the NRC app and liked it, but really trying to use this mvp feature thoroughly. Any apple watch users just use the regular workout apps to track, what do you like about the map my apps or others...i just want somethign consistant to track progress and keep my motivation up"

I had a few marks from driving or exiting the car probably, I got a tissue, wet it and cleaned them and that's what was left after that....](https://preview.redd.it/o8yskm88ie521.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42e0784ec1516e0ea6033cf271231b620cbb0b8a)

Is there any way I can repair them? Shoe polish?

Are UA shoes that bad? I really like the SC lineup and was looking to buy some more from UA, but at this rate of failing I'll skip the brand entirely...

&#x200B;

Thanks"

It's quite possibly the most obsessed I have been with a shoe ever and couldn't wait to get hold of a pair (or two). Being a big guy and playing at a high level the Hovr cushion seems to suit my needs perfectly and who doesn't love a perfect herringbone tread pattern.

Finally news surfaced that It was going to be released on the 31st of October as a Halloween colourway and I would at last be able to get my hands on them. So Halloween comes and I am checking the UA site throughout the day waiting for them to pop up but to no avail, even after seeing release reminders on other sites. 

Then I discover that they have only been released in the US so far. I live in the UK so obviously this poses a problem. I emailed customer services asking if they knew when or if the orange model would release in the UK/ Europe and they said they don't know when or if it will but I can use the borderfree ordering to order them from the US site.

There was hope. I pull up the US site and go to order, even with it looking like it was going to cost 50%+ more with the shipping and taxes and duties. And It's sold out of my size (UK12/ US13) which was the only size that was sold out at that point i think, just my luck!

So I'm lost, I don't know what to do and I might just be completely out of luck and never be able to get my hands on them. I'm not really sure what I'm posting for but just wanted to vent my frustration and disappointment somewhere and hope that maybe someone else might know where i can get hold of them or if there is any more information about further releases or anything of the sort. 

Anyway, thanks for reading!

1718,New to UnderArmour... I really need advice on what shirt to buy,4,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderArmour/comments/9j8rr7/new_to_underarmour_i_really_need_advice_on_what/,1,2018-09-26 21:58:29,"I went from 305 lbs to 195 lbs and I have loose skin. I heard UnderArmour makes compression clothing that can conceal loose skin under clothing, and so it from flapping around. 

I guess I'm fortunate that I never got big ""moobs"", so I don't have a lot of loose chest skin (although my entire skin-suit seems to have sagged a little), but my abdomen/ lower-waist is a saggy mess of loose skin. I'd really like to find under shirts/under clothes that compress my loose skin so my body looks better in nice, properly fitting shirts, etc. As of now I'm still wearing clothes that are too big and loose, just like I did when i was 305 lbs. I finally tried on some nice, properly fitting clothes, and that's what I want to wear. 

I worked really hard to lose weight without any medical intervention. I thought doing it slowly (a pound a week for 2 years) would make my skin shrink with me, but it didn't work out that way. I think it did reduce the severity of my loose skin, but it's still bothersome. 

I currently tuck my stomach skin into my boxers, otherwise it would hang over my belt line. I also have loose skin on my inner thighs. My thigh skin isn't visible when I'm wearing pants, but it does bother me when I'm working out, so I would like to buy a product to control it if possible. My stomach skin also bothers me I'm while working out, it makes a ""slapping"" sound and is embarrassing. And the way my loose skin looks look bothers me while I'm wearing my workout gear, but most of all when I'm simply trying to wear presentable, nice clothing. 

Does UnderArmour make something that could help me with my specifically explained issues? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone could tell me what items would help me. I looked online, but I don't understand the differences in products. I do want something that is breathable though and will help me stay cool.

Sort of a slippery feel to them.

They have a very thin seem (not super reinforced) and a pretty thin elastic waist band (not the thick, extra wide ones they have now).

I absolutely love these capris but I just can't find them anywhere. I'm wondering if anyone knows a place that would sell super old UA products (no luck with eBay so far) OR someone knows a similar product that's from a good quality brand.

Under Armour's Comment on Supply Chain
Approximately 50% to 55% of the fabric used in our products came from six suppliers. These fabric suppliers have primary locations in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan and Vietnam. We strengthened our relations with key strategic suppliers while also continuing to seek new suppliers to diversify our source base. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. CHARGED COTTON¬Æ products that we introduced in 2011 continue to perform strongly in the market. This product primarily uses cotton fabrics that may also be subject to commodity price fluctuations and shortages.
Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers and, fourteen manufacturers produced approximately 65% of our products, with primary locations in Jordan, Philippines, China, Nicaragua. Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. Our products were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries, with approximately 66% of our products manufactured in Asia, 14% in Central and South America, 15% in the Middle East and 5% in Mexico. All manufacturers are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our quality assurance team prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. Where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. We also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. We enter into a variety of agreements with our manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and working conditions and other social concerns. We do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. We have a subsidiary in Hong Kong to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for apparel and a subsidiary in
Guangzhou, China to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for footwear and accessories. We also manufacture a limited number of apparel products, primarily for high-profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop located at one of our distribution facilities in Maryland.

I was walking around a store today and I was surprised to find out that there are shirts for different things. Obviously I wouldn't be wearing a golf shirt to jog but I was a little more confused as to the purpose of compression fabric vs loose fitting shirts, or their t-shirts.

Can anyone help explain the differences between compression shirts, t shirts and the shirts with like air flow or cool flow or whatnot? I have no idea what each style does or its purpose and would like some clarification before investing in the wrong type of stuff."

I try to do a 1-3 hour walk at least twice a week, however i can never be 100% sure as some days see me so busy i get very little free time, my walk for the most part is somewhat fast(usually i walk to the beat of whatever song i'm listening to, if the song has a bpm of 300, then i try to walk at the same pace as the beat of the song)
I do very little running(i get exhausted way too fast, i can barely run 250m(820.21 feet)before i have to stop and catch my breath, or maybe less than that, either way i don't do much running, and i love cycling, but at the time of writing this, i have no bike(i do plan to get one though), And i do want gel padding(or whatever Under Armours version of Gel Padding is)so with that info, what footwear would be perfect for me(im size 10.5 Australia or 11 America)"

I'm trying to find an all around kayak and camp boot that is light and durable with good grip.

The speedfit neoprene like upper and thin construction looks like it would dry quickly. But the infil is goretex and looks more robust.

I could think of some things such a laying out sweaty gym cloths to dry, standing on too change shoes in the head, sit on while doing work outs in a field, or maybe even laying on in the sun to sunbath on say the beach. Someone apparently also uses it to roll up his gun in to keep stored away while going to the gym.

My question is, what is it supposed to be used for? At the least what do all of you use it for? We are really curious and starting to think of some pretty farfetched ideas."

Adidas and Nike have hardly anything in different widths. Asics only have a couple of (heavy motion control) choices.

I used to play football and my go to compression shirt was the Under Armour Men's ColdGear Long Sleeve Compression Mock. It fit me perfectly especially compared to the HeatGear variety which I found much too thin to fit comfortably. 

I have one that I currently use for working out but would like to get another. I've tried everywhere and the only type of Compression Mock available is the Evo-style one which I do not like and does not fit the same. [It appears the old ColdGear Compression Mock has been discontinued by UA. 
](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/mens-coldgear-long-sleeve-mock/pid1000512)

So I'm wondering if anyone knows of a store or website that still sells the old style Compression Mock. Thanks a lot for the input."

They fit fantastically and I love them. I bought one of the All Season 1/4 zip pullover jackets to go over my fitted top just to catch some of that pesky wind. I'm contemplating getting the Under Armour Mens Coldgear Thermo Run 1/4 zip top that Sports Authority sells right now. Here is the link for it : http://m.sportsauthority.com/UNDER-ARMOUR-Mens-ColdGear-Thermo-Run-1-4-Zip-Top/product.jsp?productId=20352476

My question is can I wear this over a coldgear top? Will it be too warm? It's fall now so I'm hoping it will be fine. I tend to go out running/biking in the early morning when it will still be chilly or cold. This is my first time buying cold weather workout gear. I want to stick with under armour and have no need to get another brand since I'm told they are very reliable. Any help you guys can give would be great. Thank you"

He brought a really nice picture for him. Was excited all day.. even standing in line and banging on the windows... even then still excited. but they never let him. It's sad. He worked hard, had a plan got there early, got the band, bought the shoes and now total disappointment.

My advise was to return the shoes and not buy Under Armour again. I dont know much about these signings, and clearly there is a loophole. The whole things was disorganized. He feels he did everything that was asked of him in order to meet his favorite player. And is totally let down."

Long story short:
The store says it operates from Canada, but ships cheap ripoffs from Hongkong. The prices aren't too crazy for an outlet so i gave it a try and man... they aren't even trying to make the ripoffs look like legit stuff.

So... Up/Down votes don't matter on this post, since all i want to create is something that will pop up whenever somebody tries to google www.canadaunderarmouroutlet.com
