Whether you know us or not, this doesn't really matter - I'm one of the founders of the Legit Check App, and I want you to help us improve our new tool, the Price Comparison.

The purpose of the PC (Price Comparison) is to reduce your effort of opening tens of tabs where you're looking for the best price on your item, as it's all in just one place.

Can you please tell me your thoughts on it, and if you find it useful? That's basically what I want to hear, whether you find this idea cool or not. Don't worry, I can take both likes and dislikes, so if you have something to say against the Price Comparison, bring it on and I'll try to fix it - let's have an open discussion about this tool :)

Let me know if you want to have a look at the website and I'll link it in the comments.

Also want to mention that this post didn't intend any sort of self-promotion, as I just want to hear people's thoughts on this."

I just really like that hoodie so I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs possible at all that they will restock size XS? Or will they just wait for all of the sizes to sell before taking that item down? Thanks everyone!"

But the quality kinda sucks and quality assurance shit the bed on this pair. There are folds in the arch of the shoe that cause discomfort when wearing them. Seriously, this is very clearly not right, just by looking at it. 

&#x200B;

What to do? Reach out to customer service via chat, right? Ha!  


CS person identifies the defect after I send photos. Then says my options are to get a refund and send back the shoes or keep them and accept the defect and that typically there would be an exchange offered, but they aren't selling this shoe right now (mind you I bought them last week in that shock drop). Their suggestion was for me to monitor the Nike site and wait for the shoe to become available again and then ask again for an exchange. 

Da fuq? Dude was stone cold serious. Somehow their shitty QA process that allowed this defective pair to be shipped is now my problem to fix. I kindly asked if he could mark my profile as priority or literally anything so that I didn't have to continually monitor the site for a shoe we have literally no intel on when it's going to be released to the public again and that maybe Nike should do their best to solve this problem for a first time customer... I'm highly suspect that I'll be getting any kind of follow up. Hopefully anyone else that got a pair of these didn't get this shitty of a product.

Kevin Durant lurks on the wing, waiting for the right time to strike before slicing his way through defences. The KD14 is designed to help versatile, relentless players like KD feel fresh all game long. Multi-layer mesh and a midfoot strap help reduce the foot's movements inside the shoe. Full-length Zoom Air cushioning plus Cushlon foam give back energy for lasting performance. This EP version uses an extra-durable sole that's ideal for outdoor courts.

Zero-Distraction Fit, Broken-In Feel

Multi-layer mesh in the upper is lightweight and dimensional with a broken-in feel. Added thickness in strategic areas helps to keep your foot in place by reducing small movements.

Strap In

A hook-and-loop strap wraps over the top of the laces for support and a secure fit. It's a subtle nod to the strap of the KD4 and takes inspiration from the shape of the grim reaper's scythe.

Ultimate Responsive Sensation

The full-length Air Zoom Strobel unit is stitched directly to the upper. It helps cut unnecessary weight and provides full-foot responsiveness. Cushlon foam adds a soft, comfortable sensation.

Tuned Traction

Grooves and ridges in the sole help provide multi-directional traction and court feel. A stiff piece under the arch helps keep the shoe stable. Both shoes together reveal the face of a skull.

More Benefits

Stiff piece on the outer edge provides midfoot stability.

The extra-durable sole is designed to play on outdoor courts.

I really want to buy these shoes but I've been seeing several people reviewing these shoes as either too large/small for them or fits perfectly. So I wanted to ask here. Do these shoes fit perfectly as the size chosen?

I have a pair of Nike shoes and my size is 9.5 (US). But I wanted to know if I should buy a size lower or a size higher. The thing is for buying a size smaller, I can't do that because the store ran out of size 9. The store is also on sale so I don't want to miss this. 

As well, I wanted to know what are these shoes good for? Like can I use them to play basketball,  running, or dancing? Or are they just for walking? Does anyone know if they're comfortable to wear for the whole day? 

Thanks for all the help!"

But the 5.5 is a tad too big and there‚Äôs a good 1.5cm between my toes and the end, so my toes move around a lot in the box?

AF1 users, do they stretch out at all so will the 5 be ok? It‚Äôs comfy but I can defo feel it on my foot. Will it stretch and will the upper become more comfy/stop pressing in??
Or should I go for the slightly too big 5.5??

875,Quick guide to get your refund if you have bought from Nike.com,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/mmntwo/quick_guide_to_get_your_refund_if_you_have_bought/,0,2021-04-08 05:11:48,"I‚Äôm not attacking the brand, just creating a small guideline for people that are not being refunded by the Nike.com online store.

On a daily basis, we can read the trustpilot reviews that orders are lost by Nike and the brand simply delays indefinitely the refund. [https://ch.trustpilot.com/review/www.nike.com](https://ch.trustpilot.com/review/www.nike.com) 

Nike delays the order in 2 main stages: after you place the order and the order is never shipped, and after the order is shipped, it gets lost. Nike does not allow you to cancel the order if it‚Äôs never shipped neither they refund you the money if the order is in a delivery state.

If you order from Nike.com, I strongly recommend that you pay the order with a VISA card to ensure that you can use the bellow guideline. 

From reviews I have read, this is not a problem in the US, it‚Äôs more an issue to European customers. Luckily, European customers are protected by EU laws so here is the procedure:

The first step is to do a formal request to demand a refund by email. Nike will take 5 to 7 days to respond (first attempt to stall). You must wait those 5 to 7 workdays before doing anything. In the 7th working day, write back to Nike demanding your refund. Nike will never respond to this email so after this point you are entitled to do a formal chargeback complaint considering it a fraud from Nike.com.

Usually, the bank will send you a form that you have to fill. Pay special attention because the entity that charges you the money from your VISA card is not Nike.com so you must provide that information to the bank when you are doing your chargeback complaint.

According to EU laws: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/chargeback\_report\_revised.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/chargeback_report_revised.pdf) , you can have in your country a specific chargeback legislation.

Important things to take in consideration: 

\-the chargeback complaint should be done within the first 120 days of the transaction. Nike.com usually stalls for some time before going dark and not responding to your emails so pay special attention to that because they count that you forget about it and if you need later to do a chargeback complaint it can be too late.

\-the investigation procedure of the chargeback can take from 30 up to 90 days so you have to be prepared to wait some time to get your money back.

My general advice is to avoid buying from their online service and use authorized retailers."

If you see a colorway listing by name, is there a way to look up the hex code that would go with that color name for shoes? Sometimes it can be hard to get an accurate hex code because of the lighting of the pictures.

Example: I know some different Nike colors names turbo green, university gold, team orange, court purple, etc Is there a way to find a specific RGB code for the colorway names that they use?

My white mesh Nike Air Max mesh got dirty (the mesh part looks grayish).

Honestly they don't look bad, it just the grayish color that kind of annoys me, I'd like them to be like brand new white (or close to it). 

I've  been thinking putting them in the washing machine on coldest option or putting them in a bucket of warm water and laundry detergent. I don't think a brush and soap would help in my case...

Has anyone tried it? Will it harm the air bubble of the shoes or deform them?

I am going to do this by running a very specific route on the app so that it shows up on the map (overall will be 20-30 miles most likely) and it will spell out ""prom?"". However, I'm doing this over the course of a month or so, so I would, for example, do half the ""P"" one day and finish it another. How can I keep track of my running locations for a long enough time frame to accomplish this? Thank you guys very much!"

You may be limited to paying collectors type prices on online auction sites. Beware that many products sold on suspect 3rd party sites are counterfeit product.

**Shoes:**

If you have access to the shoe, look behind the tongue or inside the shoe for the size tag. There is a 6 digit code followed by a hyphen and 3 digits representing the model and color. Search Google for ""Nike"" followed by the code and you'll likely find the correct shoe.

Whether you know us or not, this doesn't really matter - I'm one of the founders of the Legit Check App, and I want you to help us improve our new tool, the Price Comparison.

The purpose of the PC (Price Comparison) is to reduce your effort of opening tens of tabs where you're looking for the best price on your item, as it's all in just one place.

Can you please tell me your thoughts on it, and if you find it useful? That's basically what I want to hear, whether you find this idea cool or not. Don't worry, I can take both likes and dislikes, so if you have something to say against the Price Comparison, bring it on and I'll try to fix it - let's have an open discussion about this tool :)

Let me know if you want to have a look at the website and I'll link it in the comments.

Also want to mention that this post didn't intend any sort of self-promotion, as I just want to hear people's thoughts on this."

But the quality kinda sucks and quality assurance shit the bed on this pair. There are folds in the arch of the shoe that cause discomfort when wearing them. Seriously, this is very clearly not right, just by looking at it. 

&#x200B;

What to do? Reach out to customer service via chat, right? Ha!  


CS person identifies the defect after I send photos. Then says my options are to get a refund and send back the shoes or keep them and accept the defect and that typically there would be an exchange offered, but they aren't selling this shoe right now (mind you I bought them last week in that shock drop). Their suggestion was for me to monitor the Nike site and wait for the shoe to become available again and then ask again for an exchange. 

Da fuq? Dude was stone cold serious. Somehow their shitty QA process that allowed this defective pair to be shipped is now my problem to fix. I kindly asked if he could mark my profile as priority or literally anything so that I didn't have to continually monitor the site for a shoe we have literally no intel on when it's going to be released to the public again and that maybe Nike should do their best to solve this problem for a first time customer... I'm highly suspect that I'll be getting any kind of follow up. Hopefully anyone else that got a pair of these didn't get this shitty of a product.

They contacted Nike and everything and the only response they were able to give was to refund the money which I think is not worth since everywhere else is selling it for $400. Is there any other way to get a better outcome or is this it? 

Also the delivery company never received the package it seems like it was Nike‚Äôs fault for the package going missing."

First thing I notice was the box was smaller then a men size box and it leaves me a little skeptical because the shoe look narrower then other shoes but I'm not sure since it's my first pair of Dunk. I want to know if there's a difference between men size Dunk and women size Dunk. And if I should try to trade it for a men size since there around the same price.

Gender: Women‚Äôs (probably also unisex)
Color: They were white, possible a very light grey
Height: They were lower to mid height. 
Distinctive Features: They looked extremely ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù like I understand there are current models with ‚Äúshoelaces‚Äù and everything printed on them, but on these the fabric seemed to hang loose all over the shoe, and the Nike swoosh was only held on by a small amount of thread, leaving the rest of it to hang off pretty loosely. I don‚Äôt even believe the stitching holding the swoosh on was colored.

Kevin Durant lurks on the wing, waiting for the right time to strike before slicing his way through defences. The KD14 is designed to help versatile, relentless players like KD feel fresh all game long. Multi-layer mesh and a midfoot strap help reduce the foot's movements inside the shoe. Full-length Zoom Air cushioning plus Cushlon foam give back energy for lasting performance. This EP version uses an extra-durable sole that's ideal for outdoor courts.

Zero-Distraction Fit, Broken-In Feel

Multi-layer mesh in the upper is lightweight and dimensional with a broken-in feel. Added thickness in strategic areas helps to keep your foot in place by reducing small movements.

Strap In

A hook-and-loop strap wraps over the top of the laces for support and a secure fit. It's a subtle nod to the strap of the KD4 and takes inspiration from the shape of the grim reaper's scythe.

Ultimate Responsive Sensation

The full-length Air Zoom Strobel unit is stitched directly to the upper. It helps cut unnecessary weight and provides full-foot responsiveness. Cushlon foam adds a soft, comfortable sensation.

Tuned Traction

Grooves and ridges in the sole help provide multi-directional traction and court feel. A stiff piece under the arch helps keep the shoe stable. Both shoes together reveal the face of a skull.

More Benefits

Stiff piece on the outer edge provides midfoot stability.

The extra-durable sole is designed to play on outdoor courts.

I really want to buy these shoes but I've been seeing several people reviewing these shoes as either too large/small for them or fits perfectly. So I wanted to ask here. Do these shoes fit perfectly as the size chosen?

I have a pair of Nike shoes and my size is 9.5 (US). But I wanted to know if I should buy a size lower or a size higher. The thing is for buying a size smaller, I can't do that because the store ran out of size 9. The store is also on sale so I don't want to miss this. 

As well, I wanted to know what are these shoes good for? Like can I use them to play basketball,  running, or dancing? Or are they just for walking? Does anyone know if they're comfortable to wear for the whole day? 

Thanks for all the help!"

But the 5.5 is a tad too big and there‚Äôs a good 1.5cm between my toes and the end, so my toes move around a lot in the box?

AF1 users, do they stretch out at all so will the 5 be ok? It‚Äôs comfy but I can defo feel it on my foot. Will it stretch and will the upper become more comfy/stop pressing in??
Or should I go for the slightly too big 5.5??

On a daily basis, we can read the trustpilot reviews that orders are lost by Nike and the brand simply delays indefinitely the refund. [https://ch.trustpilot.com/review/www.nike.com](https://ch.trustpilot.com/review/www.nike.com) 

Nike delays the order in 2 main stages: after you place the order and the order is never shipped, and after the order is shipped, it gets lost. Nike does not allow you to cancel the order if it‚Äôs never shipped neither they refund you the money if the order is in a delivery state.

If you order from Nike.com, I strongly recommend that you pay the order with a VISA card to ensure that you can use the bellow guideline. 

From reviews I have read, this is not a problem in the US, it‚Äôs more an issue to European customers. Luckily, European customers are protected by EU laws so here is the procedure:

The first step is to do a formal request to demand a refund by email. Nike will take 5 to 7 days to respond (first attempt to stall). You must wait those 5 to 7 workdays before doing anything. In the 7th working day, write back to Nike demanding your refund. Nike will never respond to this email so after this point you are entitled to do a formal chargeback complaint considering it a fraud from Nike.com.

Usually, the bank will send you a form that you have to fill. Pay special attention because the entity that charges you the money from your VISA card is not Nike.com so you must provide that information to the bank when you are doing your chargeback complaint.

According to EU laws: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/chargeback\_report\_revised.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/chargeback_report_revised.pdf) , you can have in your country a specific chargeback legislation.

Important things to take in consideration: 

\-the chargeback complaint should be done within the first 120 days of the transaction. Nike.com usually stalls for some time before going dark and not responding to your emails so pay special attention to that because they count that you forget about it and if you need later to do a chargeback complaint it can be too late.

\-the investigation procedure of the chargeback can take from 30 up to 90 days so you have to be prepared to wait some time to get your money back.

My general advice is to avoid buying from their online service and use authorized retailers."

My white mesh Nike Air Max mesh got dirty (the mesh part looks grayish). I tried wiping the shoes, and it only cleaned the leather (I think its leather, not sure though) part of the shoe, but not the mesh and laces. Honestly they don't look bad, it just the grayish color that kind of annoys me, I'd like them to be like brand new white (or close to it). 

I've  been thinking putting them in the washing machine on coldest option or putting them in a bucket of warm water and laundry detergent. I don't think a brush and soap would help in my case...

Has anyone tried it? Will it harm the air bubble of the shoes or deform them? 

Any other methods that worked for you would be appreciated."
